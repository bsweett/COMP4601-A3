Even Wes Craven's new flick has been slated PG-13. It almost sickens me. Even if Saw was completely horrible, which it isn't, it would still get points in my book for at least being R. Saw proves to be a great reminder of why scary movies need to be R.<br /><br />Saw is an uncomfortable psychological thriller that follows in the footsteps of David Fincher. Think of the savagery and bloodiness of Seven with the atmosphere and puzzlement of The Game. Saw is extremely well-paced, has some great visiual (often disturbing) imagery, and has an awesome ending you won't see coming for a thousand miles. And I can't stress the fact that it is rated R enough. What more do you want?</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"Live or die. Make your choice." - Jigsaw lays down the law in "Saw"<br /><br />Carey Elwes, Danny Glover, & Monica Potter star in this semi-thriller that has some lukewarm twists, but, comes off as another rip-off of "Se7en".<br /><br />Dr. Lawrence Gordan awakens to find himself barefoot and chained to outer piping in a disgusting, & decrepit men's room, with no recollection of how or why he got there. He isn't alone as he discovers Adam, a young man in the same predicament as Gordan  sitting in the opposite corner of the room. But, worst of all is, in the center of the room a dead male face down in its own pool of blood with a gun in one hand and micro-cassette player in the other.<br /><br />After some clue searching, both men discover that there the pawns of a deadly game orchestrated by a serial killer who has a penchant for playing twisted games, in which he is the only winner. This particular game has Dr. Gordan killing Adam and going free. But, if Gordan doesn't kill Adam by 6 P.M., his wife & daughter will be slaughtered and Gordan will rot in his chains until his death. With time winding down to the dinner time hour, its up to Dr. Gordan to figure a way out and save everyone from certain death.<br /><br />"Saw" is one of those films that tries to scare, disturb, &  offend at the same time, but comes up short in each category. The film won't have you losing sleep over it & it's nothing to write home about. There are a few good shots in the film though. The twisty ending is okay, too.<br /><br />Carey Elwes gets the wussiest performance of the year as the shackled doctor. By the time he gets to do some fatal cutting, I could care if he lived or died, with the all the crying & whimpering that carried on. Danny Glover channels the dark side of Roger Murtaugh, the cop he played in the "Lethal Weapon" quadrilogy & his performance isn't near as menacing enough as the characters he portrayed in "The Color Purple" & "Witness". Monica Potter is window dressing at best with a decent fight scene at the end.<br /><br />"Saw" is a decent enough time passer (catch it when it hits HBO), but it just doesn't have enough teeth.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />It has been a very, very long time since I've walked away from a horror/suspense/serial killer film nearly pumping my fist into the air. FINALLY, my faith in American suspense has been restored. Never have I said this, but not since The Silence of the Lambs (the undisputed king of this genre) has a movie affected me as strongly - although the aforementioned film is still leaps and bounds ahead of Saw.<br /><br />Comments about poor acting have been made. I don't necessarily agree. My question would be: what were people expecting from Elwes? He's not exactly Oscar material, though I've enjoyed his performances in several films. As far as the rest of the acting, it was extravagantly believable. There wasn't a second during this movie that I wasn't entirely, fully engaged: and that simply can not be accomplished without good acting. Story and plot only take you so far.<br /><br />This movie achieved something that very few do. Examples of what I'm about to mention would be David Mamet's House of Games and The Spanish Prisoner. All three of these films lead you to believe that you know exactly what's going on, and that empowers the viewer - you think you know something that the characters on the screen do not. However, you find, even when warned that you are going to be tricked, that you *still* fall for it. You are entirely controlled by the film.<br /><br />The settings are immaculate, and the camera angles and lighting serve to bring the viewer into the movie. This is easily one of the best films of the year. Yes, horror/suspense can be considered "one of the best" - remember, the aforementioned The Silence of the Lambs won the "Big Five" Oscars: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. Granted, I don't think that Saw will win any of these because it was a tad too formulaic (with a few Scream-like scenes in it), and it lacked the one thing that Silence had: Anthony Hopkins. Still, it was an amazing film.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>From those who liked Saw (2004) `A Cut Above the Rest', `I Came, I Saw', `See Saw', `One Severed Thumb Up', `What I Saw Was Good', to those who didn't, `(S)awful', `Wish I Never Saw This', `Saw Just Couldn't Cut It', `Saw It Coming', it seems like many of the clever title variations have already been used, leaving me with...nothing (okay, it's early and I was up late last night, so gimme a break)...co-written and directed by James Wan, the film stars Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Days of Thunder) and Leigh Whannell, who co-wrote the film with director Wan.  Also appearing is Danny Glover (Grand Canyon, Gone Fishin'), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers - she was the redhead who got topless in the group shower), Ken Leung (Vanilla Sky), Shawnee Smith, whom many may recognize from television's Becker as the dumb as a brick character of Linda, and cute as a button Monica Potter (Along Came a Spider).<br /><br />The movie opens, oddly enough, in my bathroom, or, at least a very good facsimile...it's dark, dank, slimy, dirty, gritty, moldy, and generally funkified, as my good friend Robbie Van Winkle used to say, to the extreme.  As the florescent lights come to life, we see three men, two alive, one dead (I'm assuming this as he was laying face down on the icky tile in a pool of his own blood with a ginormous hole in the back of his head).  The two remaining men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) and Adam (Whannell), find themselves not only wondering how they came to be in such a place, but why they are shackled by the ankle to large pipes, each at opposite ends of the room.  Some answers are found on cassette tapes found in their respective pockets (the dead man in the middle of the room had a player) in that of a raspy voice and various clues that indicate the survival of the two men, among others, depends on their having to perform some unusual acts (two men in a bathroom performing unusual acts?  No, this isn't a George Michael video...).  The question soon becomes one of what someone would be willing to do to stay alive, and the answers may shock you...<br /><br />The general opinion for Saw seems clearly divided, and I can see both sides...but I enjoyed this nasty little movie, for what it was...so many have already compared it to (or claimed it ripped off) the popular film Se7en, so it must be true, but I found myself likening the tone of the film to the ambiguously dark and disturbing videos released by the band Tool in the 90's (I think they're still performing, but with a slightly different line up).  I think most agree the acting in Saw isn't the best, Cary Elwes' performance the most flawed, and there's a good many plot holes, but I think the good outweighed the bad, and the end result was favorable.  I was a little disappointed that Glover and Potter's roles weren't more substantial, but the upside was the story moved at a brisk pace.  The movie had a really strong opening, and kept me interested throughout, although it did sort of peter out as it went along...I will say that not once did I look at the running time left to figure out how much more I had to sit through (I'll do this often with films that bore me).  Did I find the movie scary?  Not really, but it was tense, unsettling, and definitely creepy.  I like how things unfolded, as the audience starts out knowing exactly what the main characters do, which is very little, and then revelations present themselves, but even as we become more informed (more so than the main characters), what are we to believe?  One or two of these elements were easy to discern as a means to throw us off (especially those regarding the identity of the mysterious Jigsaw killer, as he was named), but for the most part, I found myself second-guessing my theories.  The sets for the film so clearly fit the dark nature of the material, especially the dilapidated bathroom where a majority of the story took place.  My favorite scene involved Adam, learning from a clue that there may be something of use in the toilet, reaching into the thick, brown, water in the bowl...I dunno about you, but I would've checked the tank first, as I think most know the best place to hide something in a toilet would be the tank, and not the bowl... Dr, Gordon then asks, "Find anything?", to which Adam replies, "Nothing solid..." Hee hee...he then realizes it's the tank he should be looking in, and admonishes himself appropriately.  No, this isn't a comedy, but it does have a few humorous moments that were integrated nicely to enhance an overall sense of realism.  I wouldn't call this a straight up horror film, but more of a crime thriller with horror elements.  The main element that really intrigued me was the idea of placing people in situations where they have the choice of doing nothing and dying, or doing something really dangerous and quite possibly lethal (to themselves or others) for the remote chance of surviving (You know, if the producers of that Fear Factor show had any cajones, they would more closely model their show on this concept...it'd be a ratings bonanza).  In the end, looking at the film for what it is, an inexpensive (under 2 mil, I think), quickly shot (18 days), glossy initial outing, I'd say it turned out very well, and is worth checking out for a few thrills.<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen print looks great, with matching audio.  Special features include a short featurette titled `Sawed Off), rated and unrated version of the Cold Play video `Bite the Hand That Bleeds You', trailers and TV spots, a poster gallery, a commentary track with Wan and Whannell, and a cool, transparent case with an artwork overlay.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, if you dug this cinematic nugget, be on the lookout for the sequel, aptly titled Saw II, coming sometime in 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>This DVD comes in a very chic clear box, that's the good news - the bad news is everything else.  The real horror of Saw is watching a fine actor like Danny Glover damage his reputation by appearing in it - I would suggest that a much more interesting film could be made showing how a gentleman like Mr. Glover could be driven to such desperate ends.  After that, the most disturbing thing about Saw is the pretensions to intellectualism exhibited by its director, James Wan, and writer Leigh Whannell (who also acts like a person acting in the picture).<br /><br />These individuals have studied their betters carefully, combing through Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and more obscure efforts like Deathtrap and Sleuth.  Indeed, if these two had any skill at all, they might have structured the film as a play and shot the whole thing in that filthy room with the two protagonists and alleged corpse. Unfortunately, they aren't clever; they just want you to believe they are.  What drives all four of those better films is fantastic characters whose obsessions and peculiarities are fascinating.  Saw offers us a women slitting open the belly of a man so that she can paw through his intestines in time to find the key that will save her from having her head split in half.  (Edward Albee eat your heart out!)<br /><br />Which brings us to Jigsaw, the mastermind behind these devious "hands-off" killings, orchestrated so ingeniously.  Just where do the Jigsaws of the world come from?  These psychopaths seem to have unlimited time and resources, whiling away the hours dreaming up imaginative tortures, leaving lots of cleverly encrypted clues, adding presentational flair and panache to their intricate delivery, and of course, spending countless hours on victim research and pre-planning diabolical snares.  How convenient for everyone!<br /><br />If you're a 14-year old boy and video games aren't violent enough for you, you will find something satisfying in Saw.  However, if you know better, but you just have a hankering for senseless gore and mayhem, spare yourself the pseudo-intellectualism and get High Tension instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>While I will admit, with several other critics, that the acting was not great, I must resort to a comment that I made in my Grudge comment.  I did not come into this film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting.  I came into this film expecting to be impressed with a story that I hadn't seen and some imagery that would resonate throughout my mind long after the film was over.  Saw successfully accomplished this task.  While I will admit that it is nowhere close to toppling the popular Se7en, it did stand on its own two fee and provide some interesting thoughts about life and the choices we must make when placed into life-challenging moments.  It was classy in the way that it presented the story, staying away from the pitfall of being too gory, it instead placed more emphasis on simplicity and raw human emotions.  What impressed me about Saw is that it revamped the age-old Hollywood formula for these types of films.  That is what ultimately made this ending so difficult to decode.  I thought I knew exactly what was happening up until the final key moments when my mind shattered and the wildly implausible became a reality.  That is what pushed this film from your average "serial killer" film to a wickedly delightful noir-styled thriller.<br /><br />I continue reading more reviews about the acting in this film and how under par it was.  I would like to quickly mention that you are working with two of the teetering "B" to "C" grade actors of our generation.  Cary Elwes and Danny Glover could be classified as 80s superstars, but as the years passed they found themselves with less and less work, thus fading their acting ability.  After the Lethal Weapon films, I am not sure I have seen Glover in anything worth writing home about, while Elwes can be said that his career went down after Robin Hood: Men in Tights.  So, you are not dealing with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of Hollywood, but instead two actors who read a story that was original and chilling at the same time and chose to jump onto the project for sheer enjoyment.  While their acting is not outstanding, their effort and overall feeling of excitement cannot be matched.  You can watch huge blockbuster films and think to yourself that the $20 million dollar actors are just doing it to sustain the lifestyle that they have and ultimately their performances don't seem to reach their pay scale, then you can watch these smaller, limited budget films like Saw, and appreciate the work that the actors are doing.  I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with the critics out there that the acting wasn't great, but there was excitement and appreciation for their roles, and I have to give them credit for that.<br /><br />Outside of the acting, this film impressed me.  The originality of the story shocked me.  I thought it was going to be this unoriginal butcher/killer film, but instead it turned into this deeply thematic film about the values that we place on our lives as humans.  Without giving anything away, you have to appreciate what this supposed "killer" is doing to his victims.  The killer is opening the eyes of those that have taken their life and literally thrown it out the window.  While I do not think that it was done in the most appropriate way, this film did allow your mind to open.  Just like in Se7en when our killer is talking to Pitt and Freeman in the back of the police car, the words and ideas that are created will remain with you for a very long time.  Saw was a very intelligent film that coupled gruesome scenes of violence with the apathy of human existence.  To me, it worked.<br /><br />I am also extremely passionate about films that allow you to discuss the possibilities of the ending, middle, or even the beginning.  Any film that evokes conversation the moment is has finished, in my book, has done a great job.  Now, if the conversation is continually about the negative aspects of the film, then it succeeded in making a bad film, if the conversation is about the great moments, the endless possibilities, and the deeply rooted themes that pertain to life in general, than the film was successful in being good.  I despise those films that just shoot for the middle of the road, forcing you to walk away from the film or theater just not caring that you just spent your hard-earned money and time into the film.  Those films are a waste in my book.  Saw had, actually, still has me thinking about the different possibilities of the ending.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I finished the film thinking ... wow, but what does this mean?  How did this happen?  Where are we going from here?  Yada yada yada ... (did I just yada yada yada Saw?)  I could have watched it a second time back to back just to find points that I missed.  Any film that makes it exciting and interactive deserves some respect in my book ... and Saw earned it.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a much better film that I was expecting. The deeply rooted themes of human life and our choices to praise what is handed before us are strong and not often argued in film.  While the acting was about average, I did not walk into this film expecting to be blown away by performances, it was the bigger picture that I was more excited about.  Saw worked well as a whole, from the acting to the story, all the pieces put together brought a very enjoyable movie to the table, but if you look at them separately, you will not find the enjoyment, just random bits of chaos.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>I decided, after watching "SAW 3" this weekend, to give this movie another look-see, to re-evaluate and check if my original thoughts had changed over the past three years. Nope.<br /><br />"Saw" is a hack-job of a movie, cribbed from superior scripts like "Se7en" and "The Cube," where victims get lured into totally illogical situations in some psychopath's attempt at teaching them a lesson. But "Saw" completely lacks "The Cube's" fascist police state backdrop or "Se7en's" gruesome moral bent. Instead, two random men, (writer/director Leigh Whannel and Cary Elwes) are trapped in some music video concept of a warehouse bathroom with a dead man, gun and tape deck between them. And things go downhill from there.<br /><br />Cary Elwes' acting is so strident that he becomes funny by the final act, as he simply just doesn't have the chops to portray that madness he's succumbing to. Danny Glover - obviously slumming it - turns into a hysterical twit as time rolls on. Whannel is so cardboard that you need only to look at his other credentials to understand how he got his part. Dialogue is beyond corny. And that's just the actors.<br /><br />When you get to the script, the continuity is howlingly laughable. Men step from bathtubs and are dry. Items removed from water are also dry. Blood appears on victim's clothing and disappears. And in one of the most hysterically ridiculous gaffs in modern movies, a truck involved in the chase scene changes MODELS by the end of the chase!<br /><br />OK so I sat through the whole thing two times. But the movie's concept is relatively slick - enough to lure in scared patrons to two sequels and make Tobin Bell's Jigsaw one of the better movie villains in recent horror genres. (Incidentally, I feel "Saw 2" to be the best of the three films, and "Saw 3" a shade better than the original if only by benefit of better budget and better acting.) But if you take your horror/suspense movies seriously, you'll understand just how "Scary Movie 4" made hash out of "Saw" with barely an effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>A decade ago I used to watch my fair share of horror movies, but at some point I started to have trouble finding good films in this genre. This resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of horror productions I watched each year. I am happy to say that "Saw" was reminiscent of the good old times. This is a movie that has an electrifying pace, plenty of gore, thrills galore and a clever plot.<br /><br />It all starts with two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy, rusty and generally disgusting bathroom. Between the two, there is a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. The two prisoners are clueless as to what is going on, with Dr. Lawrence Gordon being by far the calmer of the two, and Adam freaking out. Of course, at this point we are asking ourselves, what does the kidnapper want? But we do not have to wait long, and soon enough, the games begin. Adam finds a tape in his pocket, and Lawrence finds not only a tape, but also a key and a bullet. You can probably guess, but just in case, let me tell you that the key does not work on the locks that are keeping them chained.<br /><br />The point of the game is that Lawrence has to manage to kill Adam by 6 pm, or the psycho will kill his wife and daughter. At that time, we also find out that Lawrence has been a suspect in previous murders by this killer. We then get a combination of flashbacks to previous events related to this case, and the ordeal the two men are going through.<br /><br />The previous cases show us a very creative and twisted individual, who does not really kill his victims, but makes them kill themselves. In these scenes you will get a high dose of gore, so this movie is not for people that are even a little bit squeamish. If you like horror films though, I guarantee that you will be entertained through the duration of this movie and that your nerves are going to be seriously tested. There is only one reason I did not give this movie five stars; the acting. Both, Whannell and Elwes, deliver sub par performances, with exaggerated facial expressions that do not fit the mood of the film. Everything else on this movie is right on target.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>Now that the mask of SAW's killer has joined up with the masks of SCREAM and HALLOWEEN in our collective unconscious, it's maybe time to take an objective glance at James Wan's movie. I haven't had the time yet to see the two sequels but the original SAW is really excellent. Good actors, which is pretty rare in this kind of production, a smart screenplay that should please amateurs of whodunit and serial killers movies as well as hard-edged horror movies fans and not too many references to previous films or disguised borrowings even if the atmosphere of CUBE and SE7EN is tangible in a few scenes. In short, SAW is a movie not to be missed if you're a movie buff.<br /><br />A DVD zone your library</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Saw with Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell is so good, so creative, and so brilliant. I thought this movie was gonna be stupid but to my surprise it's probably the most strongest horror film I have seen since Scream. The camera tricks are cool and modern, the film has this great dark green color to it, as it does in the sequel Saw II (just as good as the orginial). Yes this film is gory and bloody but it works to the point where the film is not unbearable to view. Make sure you watch for all the clues, Saw is the perfect horror flick, highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>When this movie came out in the movie theatre's I didn't see it because of my stupid friends who told me it was boring. So I decided to wait for it on dvd and I rent it at first and it was great almost every part was great so I decided to buy it and so should you there are plenty of gory parts and puzzels for you to figure out who the killer is and By the way I won't listen to my friends again because they never know what there talking about.</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>So many people have dissed this film because of the "bad acting," and "excessive gore." Well, maybe it is because I'm a dumb horror fan who is used to the so called "bad acting," but I really liked this film!<br /><br />Don't listen to those neanderthal whiners, the acting is fine, and it was not as gory as I expected, but did have some great bloody scenes, as it should! When you pick up a case that has a sawed off limb on it, then expect to see some carnage...morons.<br /><br />I'd catagorize this more as a psychological thriller. It starts off with a doctor and a freelance photographer, who are chained in a bathroom, on opposite ends. Between them is a dead body holding a gun and a tape recorder. In each of the mens' pockets is a micro tape with instructions on it. Through the dialouge, the viewer picks up on the fact that there is more to these men than meets the eye.<br /><br />Won't say more about the plot, you need to just go into this without any semi-spoilers.

"Do you think they wanted this to be dark humor or something ?"<br />I replied "No.. the actors are trying to act extremely terrified, they just can't pull it off and come across like they are doing a spoof"<br /><br />If you overlook those acting ability limitations...the whole film as a package is well done.<br /><br />At least I stayed awake thru this film unlike the horribly boring and overated "GRUDGE", which I have no idea how anybody finds interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>...to make a film more horrifying and gripping than it actually is. First off, let's get something straight. Saw is NOT a horror film. It's a thriller. Horror films, by definition, involve the supernatural. Everyone got that clear?<br /><br />As far as the movie itself, Yes, it's bloody and a little shocking here and there, but as a whole, Saw is as lukewarm as the water in the tub. That the plot is a piece of Swiss cheese is secondary. The movie's biggest problem is the acting. Both Whannell (who should really stick to writing and let attempting to act go) and Elwes shamefully overact, chewing scenery almost non-stop. Even more maddening, when Elwes stops chewing, he underacts, as if he's reading from a cue card. He was always an average actor at best, and pretty much destroys any credibility he ever had here. Danny Glover looks like someone drugged him to do the film. The worst performance I've ever seen him turn in. And, a lot of the rest of the cast is mediocre, too. As far as the story goes, well... it's a movie. The problem is, if Wan and Whannell (sounds like a comedy team) would've tried to make the screenplay smoother, and Wan himself stopped trying to be so damn "I went to film school" artistic with all the unnecessary (they add exactly zero to the film) speed-ups and weird angles, this might've been a far more shocking and engrossing film. As it stands, far too may holes and unexplained or undeveloped areas. Overall, it's just weak. Finally,in a movie like this, when one of the major premises is gore, why not go for the whole thing instead of cutting away? Yet another example of a potentially terrifying,lasting film botched by poor handling. Makes you wonder what another director and writer might have done with it. Let someone who knows how to see Saw. See?<br /><br />PS: For those folks who considered this "gripping," "terrifying,"<br />Intense" or, God help us all, "award-winning," you really need to see more movies made before 2000. That's not being condescending, but truthful. If Saw represents a great film to you, you haven't had nearly enough exposure to the medium.<br /><br />PPS: be aware that a lot of reviews give away key scenes and/or the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>It's good to know they really know what to do with those halloween body parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2O97GKCSISM3F.html">A2O97GKCSISM3F</a><br/><p>I've only seen the first four...so far, honestly I didn't have an interest in this series until I started it, after months of people trying to get me to give it a shot. Let me say, color me impressed, this isn't your typical slasher series. Tobin Bell does a very creepy charecter, but he's a demented genius concerning what he thinks of in the series. This makes SCREAM look like Disney, I only have two complaints-the violence is very graphic, and doing 8 parts maybe overkill, no pun intended. However, I do look forward to the rest of them. A word of caution though, the images in these films will Not leave your mind easily, they could also cause nausea for anyone with a weak stomache, so if that's the case you may want to avoid them...like a disease.<br /><br />August 08,2010<br /><br />I've seen the whole series at least 4 times as of recent. I also recently purchased/watched the 2-disc uncut edition. Let me start by saying the uncut is not much different than the theatrical version-the twist never fails me either. The special features are plentiful unlike the first DVD edition. I do feel that Lionsgate should've retained the traditional clear case/dust cover treatment with the 2-disc. Are there any added scenes with the uncut version? Not really, dialogue is a little different in the end scene, but it doesn't ruin the story, I don't have the blu-ray edition yet but that may change. The plot of the whole series (to me, at least) is alot more impressive<br />than I ever expected, in part one-the game per se, involves two men shackled in an abandoned restroom and they're trying to figure out how and why they are there, the twist at the end makes my jaw drop every time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>When Saw became a hit out of nowhere in 2004 nobody expected it to become a successful franchise with numerous sequels. After all with its cheap 1.2 million budget you wouldn't think it would be possible for Saw to be the highest grossing franchise in horror history. Saw is labeled as horror but it's much more complex than that, there's a lot of psychology involved. For instance the main character John Kramer, known as Jigsaw because he removes a puzzle piece from the skin of his victims, is labeled as a serial killer but it goes deeper than that. Jigsaw chooses his victims very carefully, he selects persons because 1) they don't appreciate life or 2) they've done something really wrong. He is testing their will to live trough his "games" which are traps that often necessitate the victims to lose a body part or to go to extremes. You see, Jigsaw's goal is not to kill but rather to have the survivors enjoy life; it's a therapy he made. Saw puts photographer Adam and Doctor Lawrence in a disuse industrial bathroom both with their ankle chained, I the plot is now known enough that I don't need to explain what happens next.<br /><br />Saw became a phenomenon and in my opinion is one the best horror movie of the 2000s decade; it gave the horror genre a boost and inspired other movies. Whatever people may think about some of the sequels, the original one remains a great film and I think it's one of the best horror movies made.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Initially I will admit that I had no desire whatsoever to watch 'Saw'. My expectations were that it was going to be nothing more than just another one of those splatter films whose sole aim was to nauseate and repulse the audience.<br /><br />Miracle of miracles, I happened to be wrong. While the gore element is there, for the most part it is an anticipated horror more than an actually realized one (at least by today's standards). For most of the film the terror and dread is psychological in nature and proceeds from an intelligent storyline and a thought-provoking script which dialogues with the audience on such concerns as the nature of life, death and what a person would be willing to do to retain ones life.<br /><br />For me what really makes the film work is the protagonist nicknamed Jigsaw. While his actions are indeed horrific and grotesque his reasoning comes across as rational, his goals subtle and his attention to detail flawless. Well worth a watch, or two.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I saw this movie a few years ago, and I remember it very well. This is actually a very impressive thriller. It contains lots of high tension, severe gore, and clever plot twists. The actors have done splendid jobs, and the writing is crisp and not too complex. Music is also fantastic, and the cinematography is to die for. I give this an A.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Saw begins promisingly by thrusting the viewer into a dirty basement with the two main characters, but quickly builds up so many plot holes that a good deal of the sequels' running lengths are devoted to clearing them up; if you like your horror leavened awful acting and nonsensical plotting, by all means check out Saw.</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>"Saw" is one of those movies that divides its viewers straight down the line in opinions. You either love it or hate it. Most people that dislike it will say because it's too gruesome and twisted for them. That's understandable, because "Saw" is one of the definitive in the infamous but small, "torture horror" subgenre. So that explains why people would dislike it, but what about the people that like it?<br />Well I, for one, loved this movie, and here's why: "Saw" is not just a movie about people getting thrown in a room and slicing their legs off with giant blades or else their friends will get decapitated. No, "Saw" is actually a lot more than just a "torture" horror film.<br />If you manage to look past the gruesome violence of this movie, what lies beneath is actually a very intelligent crime film, like a really good episode of "Law and Order" or "NYPD Blue", just with harsher graphic content.<br />This movie also shows us the villain's ideals. It tries to convince us that Jigsaw, the villain of the movie, is actually not a serial killer and just goes about showing people the value of life in his own, twisted way.<br />A lot of the movie is also a flashback to the police-story behind it, whereas the present in the movie takes places where two guys are chained down and locked into a room, set to a timer.<br />This "Saw" is actually a little less graphic than any of its following sequels, save for a gory headshot and sawing through your own ankle. But what this movie lacks in the heavier gore of its sequels, it makes up for in its exciting suspense and smart film-making.<br />Overall, "Saw" is one of those movies that you have to give a chance before you decide whether you like it or not. I'm sure glad I gave it a chance, because it showed me that rumors and popular talk can trick you into thinking whether or not a movie is good, or something like that.<br />But anyway, if you want a great horror movie, mixed in with some crime and thriller elements, give this a shot. You may just end up loving it. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is the best of the Saw movies by a long chalk.

This movie is very original and the ways the writter has Jigsaw torture these people is cool and very disturbing.  Personally, I didn't see the twist at the end coming and was blown away, I think that is why this is my favorite of the Saw series.  Highly recommending, but be forewarned; it's demented.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Many people are either going to enjoy Saw or hate it, and both for the same reasons - those sick, twisted games you gotta play to shed blood (and usually more) to see how badly you want to live.  Not only did Saw raise the bar on horror, it practically started the whole "gore" horror sub-genre (thus leading to films like Hostel, and making it a rare find to not see a recent horror film focused more on gore than the classic horror scares.  Personally, I can't say I am in love with this film because of the gritty nature, but it is still scary entertainment to an extent nonetheless.  However, with questionable films such as these today, I still enjoy the pleasure of seeing if there is a positive message I can still hack out of this, and though it's certainly wrapped around in insanity, the message is clear - are you grateful to be alive?<br /><br />This is where Saw gets my praise for being very original.  It's certainly scary at times and packed with grit, but it also has a side of it that makes you think.  Kind of a mystery to be solved, and when the answer is revealed in the heightened climax, its quite rewarding cause no one could have ever seen it coming.  The story uses flashbacks and pieces them together like a puzzle up til the very end, and just when you thought you knew what the puzzle is going to look like, it turns out to be a whole other picture.  The traps in Saw also carry originality, putting people in near impossible situations to escape, but not impossible.  Our villain Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is no murderer, but he finds ways for people to kill themselves - which is usually the case.  The reason for the traps is explained as a game you must play (in Jigsaw's eyes) to test and see how much you desire life.  Generally those placed in the traps are not grateful to be alive, and these horrific games quickly put things in perspective.  Once you see these scenes, its enough to say "Yes I am grateful."<br /><br />The cast is an interesting mix for a horror film.  Danny Glover is probably the most famous actor associated with the film, but the script is somewhat limited for his role that any actor probably could have pulled it off.  Cary Elwes is also an interesting addition when I think back to his roles in Princess Bride and Men in Tights...his character is the main focus in this film and his acting may have been better suited in non-horror films.  Tobin Bell, while he gets very little screen-time as Jigsaw and even then he is usually wearing a cloak, he feels like a perfect cast (though I say this after watching the Saw sequals where he gets a lot more screentime). Tobin Bell is to Jigsaw like Anthony Hopkins is to Hannibal Lecter - you see the actor's face and that's the role he was born for.<br /><br />Overall, Saw brings a variety to a horror film, though really its much more than your basic horror film.  It focuses less on scares and more on what's truly scary - very disturbing scenarios that ask a simple question, and the mystery of events that is impossible to solve.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Horror/Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Back in 2004, Lion's Gate released an ultra low budget yet very inventive horror film that spawned one of the most profitable horror franchises in the past decade.  The original Saw draws inspiration from older slasher and exploitation films with some great ideas of it's own.  Two, seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell) wake up in chains with a hacksaw between them.  They both are caught in a game weaved by a serial killer called Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) who claims to have their families captive.  In the meantime, a desperate cop (Danny Glover) is on the killer's trail, and it's safe to say that no one gets out of this in one piece.  It took me a while to check out Saw, as I'm not very much into what's considered modern horror movies.  However, it was good to see a new age horror film that takes advantage of the genre by offering up gallons of blood and gore to go along with stomach churning set pieces.  If there's anything bad to say about Saw, it's that the acting is very wooden, there's plenty of leaps in logic, and the first is definitely the best.  All in all, if you've never seen the original Saw, it's better than you might think, and definitely worth checking out, particularly for older horror fans missing that bite that the horror films of years gone bye were infamous for.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>When I went to go see "Saw" late last night I was thinking "saw" as the past tense of see and not "saw" as the noun ("a hand or power tool or a machine used to cut hard material and equipped usually with a toothed blade or disk") or as the verb ("to cut with a saw").  What was I thinking?  "Saw" is in the Grand Guignol of "Seven" and "The Bone Cutter," and apparently had to make some last minute cuts to avoid getting saddled with a NC-17 rating.  That alone with give you an indication of what first time director James Wan and first time writer Leigh Whannell were going for in "Saw," even with only $1.2 million to make the film and 18 days to shoot it.<br /><br />Adam (Leigh Whannell), a young man, wakes up underwater in a dark room with a chain around his ankle.  He is not alone, and when the light come on he finds himself is what appears to be a long abandoned public restroom.  At the other end is Lawrence (Cary Elwes), who is also chained to a pipe.  On the floor in between them, out of their reach, is the corpse of a man who apparently killed himself with a gun.  In his hand is a tape recorder.  After becoming oriented to his strange surroundings, Adam discovers a plastic bag in his pocket, containing an envelope.  Inside is a key and a small cassette tape with the words "Play Me."  Let the game begin.<br /><br />Beyond that you really do not want to know that much about this before you see it, and given the dreck that passes for horror thrillers in recent years "Saw" is worth the seeing in the theater.  The last time I actually went to see a film in this genre in a theater was probably "Hannibal," and I have not had any reason to regret being selective in this regard.  However, this is not going to be a date movie, but one for hardcore fans of the genre who prefer their DVD editions to be the director's unrated cut of the film.  "Saw" is a film that works more in the world of horror films than it does in the real world, but that is certainly part for the genre at this point.<br /><br />The entire film does not take place in the abandoned restroom, although that is main arena.  Lawrence knows something about the "Jigsaw Killer," who has been constructing elaborate dances of death in which his victims have to try and save themselves.  Only one victim has survived to date (Shawnee Smith), so it is possible to get out of this alive, just extremely difficult and we are treated to a couple of examples of where it did not go as well.  Investigating the case are a couple of detectives, Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), and the chronology of the film gets skewed as the present and the past become confused.  The game also involves more than the two men chained to the wall, because Lawrence's wife, Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter, Diana (Makenzie Vega) are part of it as well.<br /><br />During the film's endgame things are moving fast enough that you probably will not be able to figure out how it will all play out even though "Saw" overplays the obvious red herring card.  The film pushes one of my least favorite buttons a couple of time, which is when somebody has a gun on the villain and does not blow them away.  If there is one thing we have learned from all of these movies it is that hesitating when you have the bad guy in your sights is never a good thing.  I especially go through the roof when a trained law enforcement officer is pointing the gun right at the killer and the killer still gets away (even Clarice Starling is guilty of this sin in "The Silence of the Lambs").  So there is some heavy handedness to Whannell's script that hopefully will be replaced by something more elegant when he and Wan make their recently announced "Saw 2" sequel for 2005.<br /><br />But "Saw" is not an elegant horror film, although Wan gets points for keeping the most horrific moment of the film off screen (even though the rationale is small budget and not true aesthetic choice, which makes me fearful for what will happen when Wan and Whannell have a much bigger budget for the sequel).  The "Jigsaw Killer" has a warped interest in having his victims better appreciate their lives, so getting out alive has to do not only with Lawrence and Adam solving the tasks they are given, but also with finding out some important things about each other.  The important thing here is that the film's final scene is pretty horrific, even if the film cheats a bit to get to that point, and that even when the screen goes dark and the credits start to roll, Whannell keeps the horror going.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>With some of the PG-13 tripe coming out as horror nowadays, SAW is a refreshing step back into the good old days where horror meant blood, and blood meant horror.  No annoying harpies or pretty pictures of hell or tragically humanized vampires here, just an ingenious killer with an obscure motive.<br /><br />SAW dives right into the depths of the madness too, opening with our killer's current victims, two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy restroom, a body in the center clutching a cassette player and a handgun.  Each man is given a tape to play, which provides him with a nice dilemma to ponder during his captivity.  The background of the killer and the events leading up to the men's current situation unfolds nicely during narrated recollections and well-placed flashbacks, while the actual motive stays hidden underneath the obvious delight the killer derives from the simple pleasures of torture.<br /><br />Because SAW also brings to film an excellent `Whodunnit?', I am not going to elaborate on the storyline any further.  Suffice to say that Cary Elwes and Danny Glover give excellent performances (Elwes surprising me since I have only seen him in comedy roles), the photography is good, the killing methods tasty, the blood not really overdone but still dosed out well, and the plot sustainable.<br /><br />Lets face it fans, we don't go to horror movies to learn how to do decoupage, we go to get scared and grossed out.  SAW fulfills that primal hankering, leaving you to utter `blech' and `bravo' in the same troubled breath, and wondering what your punishment would be like under the careful ministrations of this psychopath.<br /><br />Aficionados of the genre are going to love SAW's mixture of gore, insanity, ingenious traps, and filth, while non-lover's of the theme should stick to `Sleepless In Seattle' and other such ilk.  SAW put the taste of terror and gore back in my mouth, something that has been lacking in some of the recent sugar-coated intruders into this bloody domain.  Enjoy!!</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Saw' is a delightful movie to review, as it is such a mix of both good and poor qualities that it is a challenge to weigh them against one another to see what comes out ahead. For the impatient, I will say that I think the two cancel one another out in weighing the overall quality of the movie; however, the interesting aspects make the movie worth seeing and buying, in spite of the negatives.<br /><br />The first and most important positive for a horror film is the visceral reaction of the viewer. Did the movie scare, frighten, or cause mad dashes to the bathroom to clean out soiled underpants? The answer to this question for me is a tentative yes, but only with regard to a single, minor character, where the movie played the `Aliens' / `The Exorcist' card which put a child at genuine risk, not the supernatural, kinda spooky, kinda neat type of menace of `Poltergeist'. So my score on this point is positive.<br /><br />A second important positive for a horror film is the inventiveness of the threat. `Halloween' scores big on this point with its creative minimalism of a psychopathic stalker with a blank, white mask. This is in strong contrast to a lot of more elaborate scare scenarios done up until `Halloween' was made, whereupon everyone copied John Carpenter's idea. Another prime example among `B' movies is '28 Days Later' which changes the rules about how zombies are expected to act. It doubles its impact by adding a twist to the behavior of a group of survivors which seems to be making a psychological statement not unlike the classic `Lord of the Flies' survivors novel. My favorite example from A list movies is the nature of the threat in `Alien'. The object lesson here is to be sure to hire a great graphic artist when you design your monsters.<br /><br />The seemingly most striking original element of `Saw' is the fact that the perp is not literally killing the victims himself, he is putting them in situations where they do things which leads to their killing themselves, or at least failing to find their way out of a trap before the trap is sprung and they are killed by the environment created by the perp. While this is the element of originality explicit in the movie, this story line may not be quite as original as the authors would have you believe. There is a strong similarity between the fate of the victims in `Saw' and the way in which the murders are done in `Seven'. In both cases, the scenario in which the vics die is connected to perceived past sins. And, the deaths in `Seven' are to some extent a result of the victims' own actions.<br /><br />The truly more original aspect of `Saw' is that it is laid out very much like an adventure video game, where progress or even survival is based on solving puzzles. Clues are doled out by a very stingy puzzle master and they are generally couched in riddles, so we double the fun by making one answer one puzzle to get the clues needed to solve the next puzzle. The frustration in seeing the nested puzzles, yet you are stuck at the first step. Reminds me of the frustration of trying to find my way into the Underground Empire in `Zork I'. I must also say that most of the perils created by the perp win points for originality. These add to the dangers to those among us with weak bowels.<br /><br />The biggest question for the audience is for how long does the filmmaker maintain the suspense for the viewer? The answers to some of the puzzles are evident to the audience long before they dawn on the characters, partly because the producers let the cat out of the bag for at least one major piece of business in their promotional material. The writer did manage to keep the identity of the ultimate perp hidden until the very end of the movie, largely by presenting us with a fairly transparent red herring that kept our attention diverted from the real puzzle master.<br /><br />Weighed against these positives is a rather serious list of negatives beginning with the question of whether the two main characters would really behave as they did in the movie if they were presented with their situation. I think the initial panic is real enough, but I think the writer does not give enough credit to the problem solving abilities of a normally intelligent person, and at least one of the two principals is a highly educated surgeon. I really suspect that with the tools at hand, the two principle vics would have been a lot more clever in being able to free at least one, so he could go get help. As evidence of this, I offer the resolution to a similar problem in Stephen King's novel `Gerald's Game'.<br /><br />If you resolve the improbabilities, you are left with some bad writing for the roles of the police detectives working this case, lead by Danny Glover. The glaring contrast between Glover in this movie and Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman in `Seven' makes my point better than anything else I can say. This is not Glover's fault, except in the fact that he decided to play this weak role to begin with. I am inclined to say that the movie would have been much better if the roles of Glover and his partner had been eliminated or minimized. The movie makers probably felt they needed the detectives' business to have someone to chase perps and take bullets from the potential perp and from booby traps, since the two main characters are trapped inside their own personal dungeon. The cops also introduce scenes from past perp scenes that fill out the way in that our perp works and thinks.<br /><br />The movie does not live up to its hype, but it is worth a good chill.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Oh, what this movie could have been.  I don't think the directing or acting was that bad.  But the script was too generic.  A little research was needed.  Let me explain:<br /><br />#1. A doctor would never say he had been electrocuted because he knows what the word means!  It means you are dead.  The average person does say that when they are shocked; doctors NEVER do, ever.<br /><br />#2. Why would the good doctor use the saw (removing...well, I don't want to give anything away)when he could have used his shirt to reach the cell phone on the floor?<br /><br />#3.  The twist of the movie is not really a twist at all.  I don't want to give away the plot, but it doesn't hold up as being a "Wow, I never would have guessed that?" movie - if that is really what the author was shooting for.  The viewer was not given enough information to make the shock value come out.<br /><br />#4.  The detectives would have discussed the "other" evidence in the case: hundreds of feet of razor-wire, timing devices, the safe, the candles, etc.  Why did none of this material lead them to a purchase location?  This needed to be explained, because there has never been a killer, in the history of killers, who has left so much material behind.  He had to buy or steal this stuff from some place.  And some of the material was so unique, like the contraption he strapped to the one woman's head, that they would have to be able to trace the origins.<br /><br />#5  I was sickened by another film where a person who has just been terrorized by an EVIL person doesn't pull the trigger when the tables turn.  I've seen thirty years of that ridiculous scenario.  When will Hollywood learn how dumb that is.  I would have shot the guy in the forehead until his brains became artwork on the carpet.<br /><br />Okay, all that said, the movie did have some good acting and some really creepy scenes.  It is disgustingly horrific and a little interesting.  The film could have been so much more with a little more thought and research put into the script.  Ya can't blame this one on the acting.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>I went to "see saw", simply because I am a huge elwes fan. I haven't always liked every film he's been apart of, but all in all he's very dependable. After reading the reviews of several critics and balancing whether or not I should spend the twenty bucks, I sauntered into the theater with low expectations. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Saw opens with two men in complete darkness. Only their voices are heard, as they figure out a way to turn the lights on. It takes a little courage to start a film this way. No explosions. No endless galaxies. Darkness and two voices. That drew me in pretty quickly. Then, once they take that step, the film begins.<br /><br />Saw is not perfect. Is any film? It has dozens of puzzles that unfold at exactly the time the plot deems it necessary. Yes, it feels sometimes forced. To me it felt like a train ride, you know its always going to go in one direction, but as long as you reach the destination, no one cares. I didn't. I just sat there, allowed the film to have its way with me, sipped my pibb, then walked away with a grin. It does touch on other films like se7en, which is sitting on my shelf right now, but if it wasn't made, would we still be bashing Saw? Also a key difference is in this we get to see the actual events, rather than the aftermaths. Also, you cannot guess the ending before it comes. Its near impossible. Yes, that's a challenge.<br /><br />I am going to conclude on this. I do recommend Saw, simply because it has managed to do something very few films have accomplished. It has a secret. A one million dollar budget. That is unheard of! It continues the trend of low-budget, independant films that are sweeping the globe in massive success. Saw has earned nearly 72 million dollars world wide. I say congratulations to all envolved, and cudos on making something out of nothing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>This film harkens back to the old days of horror films which were loaded with blood and good old-fashioned terror.  Many of today's horror films have left out much of the blood, but that is not the case with "Saw".<br /><br />Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) find themselves in a very dirty and unkept bathroom, each chained at opposite ends of the bathroom  to a pipe.  There is a dead man in the middle of the bathroom, lying in a pool of blood and clutching a tape recorder in one hand and a gun in the other.  After overcoming their initial shock, Lawrence and Adam decide that they must work together in order to get out alive. They begin to search the bathroom for anything that might help them escape, but the only items they find are two hacksaws that prove to be worthless in cutting through the chains that are holding each man to their respective pipes.  Each man discovers that they have a small cassette tape in their pockets.  After retrieving the cassette player from the dead man, Lawrence discovers that in order to survive, he must kill Adam before the clock on the wall reaches 6:00. Also, Lawrence finds out that his wife and daughter have been taken hostage, and they will be killed if Lawrence fails to kill Adam.  This sets off a desperate race against the clock to try to escape, as well as finding out the identity of their captor.  Will Lawrence and Adam survive?  Will Lawrence kill Adam?<br /><br />This movie is very good.  The plot is brilliantly conceived, and the twists and turns are definitely the highlight of the film.  A lot of good background information is provided in the flashbacks expreienced by Dr. Gordon.  The ending of the film was totally unexpected, and it will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The plot is extremely well conceived and the story is teriffic.

Not for the squeamish and it's really dumb to see some scenes where they go into fast motion (example...car chase scene). Also starring Tobin Bell (THe Pelican Brief), Benito Martinez (TV'S The Shield) and Ken Leung (Rush Hour, AI:Artificial Intelligence).</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I had been told by a few people who had seen the movie that it was laughable and in no way frightening, yet other reviews here on Amazon seemed to speak from a different standpoint.  So, as a true fan of terror on film, I had to judge for myself.<br /><br />I found the plot to be quite creative and intriguing.  The scenarios Jigsaw stages are intricate, alarming and bizarre- leaving his victims to make terrifying choices in order to survive his "game".<br /><br />At the opening to this movie, you are thrown straight into the thick of things.  The movie begins with two men chained to pipes in a dilapidated room, with a dead man lying in the middle of the floor.  The story then slowly and deliberately begins to unravel, with each man ultimately learning why he is there.  Danny Glover is introduced soon after as an investigator on the Jigsaw case.  Cary Elwes surprised me in this role, showing a far darker side than he's ever before revealed on-screen.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful and interesting, with a good and somewhat startling ending.  It turned out to be far better than I was told it would be.  I'm glad I decided to see for myself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>This movie doesn't have much to offer. It's typical horror, psychological stuff that will either thrill you or leave you wondering why you even bothered to rent it. And one shock (which happens in the end) doesn't make up for a mediocre movie. The characters don't learn anything about themselves, the "killer's" (he's more like a puppermaster) motivation lacks depth, and his choice of victim is screwy with what motivation we do get. This movie is just, well, stale.<br /><br />So Adam and Lawrence wake up in a dirty bathroom, each chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room with a guy who has blown his head off laying between them. They don't remember how they got there, nor do they know why they of all people were so unfortunate as to end up in a smelly, disgusting bathroom. Lawrence thinks he knows who did it-- the same guy, known as the jigsaw killer, who had killed (or rather set up his victim's to kill themselves) several people. We learn that Lawrence was a suspect. Anything of importance about Adam, Lawrence, and the killer, are revealed in a series of flashbacks. It's a tad confusing, but it's all sorted out in the end. And the final shock is actually pretty good. I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />This movie is just under par in terms of character. I really want to see a horror movie that has a killer with awesome motivation and victims who use their heads instead of machetes to discover the mystery murderer. If Lawrence had thought about the situation a little more, he would've concluded that sawing his foot off (yes, he does that, and it's cringe-worthy) was a bad idea. Not a bad movie, not a good movie, just a typical Saturday night horror flick. Better than other horror films that have come out recently though. House of Wax, anyone?</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>This movie scared the living daylights out of me.  The bad guy was so twisted and evil that I won't forget him for a while.  I felt the acting was quite good also.  The premise of waking up and finding yourself chained up with no memory of how you got there kind of reminded me of Cube, which is another great film if you haven't seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Lawrence (Elwes) and Adam (Whannell) wake up chained to pipes in the world's filthiest bathroom.  They have little freedom of movement and cannot even come close to reaching each other.  They do not remember how they got there or know each other.  Their captor (presumably) has left them two saws, an unloaded gun, a tape recorder,  two cigarettes, and a dead body in the middle of the room.  They are victims of the Jigsaw Killer, and that same killer is holding Lawrence's wife and daughter hostage.  At the same time, an ex-cop (Glover) is hunting down the killer, bent on revenge for the murder of his partner.<br /><br />"Saw" is an intense, twisted movie.  It is reminiscent of "Seven" in both mood and atmosphere, and leaves you with about the same feeling when it is all over.  For me, that is good, because I believe "Seven" to be an excellent movie.  "Saw", however, is not at that level...but it is close.  Director James Wan ratchets up the tension with each passing moment until the final scene.  And while the explanation might not hold up as well as the the viewer might like, it was still a hell of a ride.  Elwes especially does an excellent job as a man first confused by his situation, then terrified for his family, then resolute in what needs to be done.<br /><br />"Saw" is a great Halloween movie, and if you are looking for a good scary movie at this time of the year, "Saw" is your best bet.  Highly recommended for horror fans.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>When `Saw' was first released it took the nation by storm.  It was the freshest thing to hit the world of horror and it still to this day has a large following.  With `Saw IV' set to hit theaters this weekend the anticipation is already thick for what new and disturbing things lay in store for the general public.  With the sequels though there has been an onslaught of critics for the original film as well calling it an overrated piece of trash.  I feel that this is an unfair assessment.  The original film was unique and thought provoking.  Finally we had a detour from the abundance of prefabricated copycats, horror films that relied heavily on severed limbs and large amounts of gore to establish a fan base.  This is not to say that `Saw' is lacking in the gore department, or even in the severed limbs area (just what do you think that `saw' is for) but it's smarter than that.  By the closing credits the audience has been forced to really open their minds, turn on their thinkers and delve into the material presented before them.  Saw is gritty, real, disturbing and most importantly stimulating.<br /><br />The film opens with two men waking up in a room alone with a corpse.  The two men are chained to opposite sides of the room, the corpse lying between them just out of reach.  The two men are Adam, a student, and Lawrence, a doctor.  Soon after awakening the two men are informed that they only have a short period of time before they are to be killed.  They have been left clues in order to lead them to survival but they must find and follow them.  Before long it becomes apparent that they are being toyed with by a mastermind bent on making them atone for past indiscretions.  As their sanity begins to fray they uncover that they are linked in more ways than their current situation.<br /><br />As far as acting is concerned, this is far from a showcase that's for sure.  Cary Elwes is somewhat all over the place here and Leigh Whannell (who co-wrote the film with director James Wan) is very amateur.  Danny Glover is decent as is Monica Porter but really the only effective actor is Tobin Bell and he's rarely seen, only heard.<br /><br />What `Saw' lacks in acting it makes up for in originality and sheer eeriness.  In fact this is one of the only films that have kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  It has been compared to `Se7en', which is a nice compliment (`Se7en' is the better film), but `Saw' really is a film all its own.  Aside from the scare tactics there really is no similarity between the two films.  The subsequent sequels have been less effective than this original and it's a shame that Hollywood rushes these things because of that `it' factor, embracing a hot commodity to the effect of tarnishing a good thing.  If only a little more time and effort had been placed into creating sequels with the same originality and gritty flare as this original film then maybe we would have a complete set of worthy horror films.  Sure `Saw' has its flaws (mostly found within the acting) but it works hard within the script and plot to make up for its flaws and deliver one disturbing, horrific and gruesome good time.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Jigsaw, what a crazy man, so he has an illness, okay so now everybody has to pay, espically the people who don't value thier lives or thier famliy, how messed up is that. Well it is twisted. this movie has an original story to it. its not like those other serial killer films. This movie rocks. and to top it all of it has the best and most suprising ending to it unlike most horror films. this movie is awesome.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Jigsaw is a diabolical and ingenious menace.  He is not a serial killer per se, but someone who puts people in situations where they kill themselves and others.  Each victim finds themselves in tense situation where they have to make hard decisions regarding what they will do to go on living.  The main story concerns two individuals who awaken in an abandoned bathroom chained and confused.  In the middle of the room is a dead body in a spreading pool of blood.  There is a gun and a tape player, both out of reach.  But each of the two men have found a cassette with the words Play Me on them.<br /><br />The to men discover the game they are part of.  If successful, one of them will be dead.  If not, certain loved ones will die instead.  There are rules to be followed.  As the two become more and more desperate, we learn more about them and the evil mind that has put them in this situation.  Although the two are the center of the story, we also get tied up with several other victims and the police investigation.  The action get more and more tense as the time limit is almost reached.  In the end the story delivers with a series of twists at the end that just leave you stunned.  A very good film.<br /><br />This two-disk edition has some interesting features including the original short film that was expanded into the current film.  I have to say that it was a pleasure to see an intelligent horror film again (they are so rare).  I hope the sequel is just as intelligent.  The acting, action, and settings were top notch.  Several moments made me jump (also a rare thing).  As the credits began to roll and all of the twists sank in fully, all I could think was, "Neat!"  If you like your horror raw and intelligent then this is one for you.  If you just want a mindless killer like Jason, then this will not fit the bill.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I avoided this film for so long until a friend loaned it to me. I watched it last nite and I was quite impressed. To compare this to "Se7en" is absurd; there's little or no comparison. Director James Wan's youthful zeal and excitement is beautifully executed, but nothing can compare to David Fincher's meticulous style.I was expecting another stupid slasher flick, and was pleasantly surprised to be presented with quite an original narrative that had me fascinated. I did NOT guess the ending, though I tried, because it was so well written and edited. The acting wasn't very good, though not totally unbelievable. After all, hysterical is an emotion that's hard to sustain for 98 minutes if you're an actor. James Wan's focus may not have been as precise as he'd wished, but I look forward to his next project. The extras on the DVD are minimal, but Mr. Wan's enthusiasm on a short extra impressed me. I enjoyed it and was entertained a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I was impressed with the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in 2003...<br /><br />That's about it.  It just seems that no matter how hard they try, movie execs can't seem to release a decent horror film, something gritty and disturbing and downright horrifying.  They just can't do it.<br /><br />And then there was Saw.<br /><br />This movie is amazing in the fact that it breaks down to a simple formula of twists and thrills, bypasses the special effects and CGI crap that pollutes too many scary movies these days and focuses on something that could take place, something that could really happen versus the faux thrills expidited by cheap ghost storys and sci-fi.  This is the type of movie that will leave you disturbed long after you watch it.  You'll think about it a week, two weeks, a month later while you lay awake and wonder if there really is a man that sick and twisted...<br /><br />Yes...<br /><br />He is out there...<br /><br />So by now EVERYONE knows the premise.  Two men wake up in a nasty restroom chained to oposite ends and theres a dead man in the center of the room.  They both have choices to make, clues to unravel in order to make it out alive.<br /><br />That's all I'm going to tell you...<br /><br />Trust me, if you haven't seen Saw by now you need to watch this movie.  It is truly an origional film with genuine scares and real backbone.  Not for the faint of heart, but for the horror fan in us all, the fan whos getting increasingly preturbed with the lack of scares and the redundancy in recent horror instalments...this is for you my friends...<br /><br />Relish in it.<br /><br />It won't come again.<br /><br />Not for a long time...<br /><br />(Actually, Saw II is even better...but I didn't see that coming!)</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>SAW is one of those movies it will take you repeated viewings to dissect certain parts and understand the plot and the importance of the characters, and boy are you in for one hell of a surprise ending when you see it for the first time. This is one of the best suspense horror movies in recent years, and hopefully SAW II will be no different.<br /><br />SAW tells the tale of a serial murderer known as the "jigsaw killer" who decides to kidnap two men, one is a doctor who is married to a beautiful wife and has children with her, while the other man seems very insignificant to us, not bearing any importance or meaning to us in the movie, except that he committed some kind of heinous act according to the the killer. Both of these men are put in dank room with dirty white walls and a mysterious body lying in the middle of the room (and we're to believe that it's dead). The doctor (played by Cary Elwes) is handcuffed by the ankle to a fixture, and the other man is handcuffed by his wrist, and this ultimately becomes the precursor of an evergrowing race to break free and stop the killer himself. The jigsaw killer is committing a series of grisly killings, all the while tormenting the two men he has trapped. The movie's tension builds and paramounts into a shocking and grisly climax that ultimately descends into the movie's surprise ending...you will never see this coming, trust me. It worked quite well to jolt my chill factor. And this new UNCUT edition of the movie is even more grisly. You are going to be even more repulsed by this smart horror film.<br /><br />SAW spins a web of suspense, scares, and brains into a complex and jolting thriller that most certainly will prepare you for what's to come with it's follower, SAW II. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>This is definately one of those movies you'll have to watch a few times to fully understand what exactly is going on.

The overall premise is very clever:  A young man (played by Whannell, who also wrote the film) and an established physician (a much heavier, less charismatic Cary Elwes than in previous works) wake up in a disgusting, polluted bathroom and have no recollection of how and why they wound up there.  They are chained to the walls and accompanied by only one guest-a dead man with his head blown off.  As the doctor and his youthful companion piece the puzzle together, they realize that they are being tormented by the infamous "Jigsaw" killer, a maniac who juxtaposes his victims within scenarios in which they have to choice between their own lives or the deaths of others.  The identity of the killer is unknown, but as the truth from both of the captured men seeps through, the film picks up momentum and unfolds to a rather incomplete, far-from-stanch climax.<br /><br />Danny Glover stars as the aging detective who was originally assigned to the "Jigsaw" case, but was unable to completely close the case.  Due to an increasingly devote fascination with the killer, the detective attempts to stop the evil murderer once and for all.  "Saw" does possess some pizzazz and intelligence, using Elwes and Co. as players in a strange and macabre game of chess; however, the film is too disjointed and acted with such mediocrity that it cannot be taken too seriously.  The novice director Wan uses some excellent, hip cinematography to liven up the film and create some tense atmosphere, but "Saw" is never incredibly scary, but does keep you guessing until the very last frame.  Disappointing performances from Elwes and Glover.  A nice attempt for modern horror film standards, but films such as "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs" did it much, much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>Great suspense and great plot= a great movie.

When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to "Seven" started to float through my mind.  About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to "Seven".  Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan.  Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well.  About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed.  For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Over the last decade or so, little has excited the Hollywood establishment more than the 'Thriller', or 'Serial Killer Movie'. (Well not all thrillers involve serial killers, but virtually all the major recent ones do)  I generally don't watch these films.  Sure, 'Silence of the Lambs' was pretty good, and 'Seven' was good too, but most of these films just look tedious and formulaic, and what little I have seen has fulfilled these expectations. Now we have 'Saw', and I'm pleased to say that it isn't really a thriller, and leans more to the horror side of the spectrum.  Sure, there's a serial killer in the movie, and the visual style is massively indebted to Fincher, but at it's heart, 'Saw' is really just a low-budget horror film.(Only about a million dollar budget, shot in 2 1/2 weeks)  These sorts of films can't complete with major productions in terms of acting and production values, so they put all the emphasis on ideas and scenes.(Well, the good ones do, anyway)  So understand this all coming in- the acting isn't going to be up to major production standards, and the plot isn't going to be as developed or plausible.  If you can't get over those two things, you aren't going to enjoy this.  'Saw', however, makes up for it in other ways.  It's got frightful, intriguing ideas and interesting scenes and a strong, expressionistic (if derivative) visual style.  It may not all add up cleanly at the end, but the scenes are good enough that that doesn't really matter.<br /><br />Though I'm sure everyone already knows, the basic setup is this: Adam and Lawrence wake up in an old, abandoned bathroom.  They are each chained to pipes on the opposite sides of the room.  There is a corpse in between them, an apparent suicide victim, who is holding a tape player and a gun.  They soon learn that they are the victims of the Jigsaw killer, who places people in a elaborate games of death, from which they may be able to escape alive.  They will have to suffer, however.  In this case, Jigsaw requires that Lawrence kill Adam by 6:00, or else Jigsaw will kill Lawrence's family.  The rest of the movie is just their attempts to deal with this situation, and some flashbacks to help them figure out just what is going on.(They're more than a little disoriented, initially) This basic setup is more horror than thriller, as the police only play a very minor role, and there is very little investigation into the killer's life or identity.  They are simply common people in a life or death situation, who must escape.  In lots of ways, the basic plot is pretty Giallo-esque.(Italian thriller precursors which involved a crime investigation,but almost invariably placed style, atmosphere and set-pieces ahead of plot or plausibility)  It uses numerous giallo conventions: the protagonists are regular people, every character matters, the killer's motivation is very giallo-esque (can't be completely specific w/o giving too much away) most everything proves to be connected, and the mandatory twist ending is more of a ludicrous sick joke than a grand revelation. (Not to say that I don't like the ending. I like it a lot)  Naturally, this sort of film is even more convoluted and unlikely that you typical thriller, and I suspect it's just a reflection of sloppy writing rather than same grand scheme, but it reveals the general aesthetic of both these types of films: scenes and ideas first, plot second.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a combination of ultra grimy, sleazy settings with a few high-class but cold and dark places as well.  As I said before, it is massively indebted to David Fincher's work, but that's a very good style.  Well worth ripping off.  The intense griminess and stylization of visuals also sets it apart from most thrillers, as it is taken to such a point that the world no longer seems even remotely real. (Though some thrillers are like this. i.e. `Seven',) Sometimes Wan over does it a little, with some fast-motion-spinny-camera stuff that's just sorta silly, but most of the time it works.  There are some very weird visuals that are, once again, quite typical of independent horror and giallos while being foreign to mainstream thrillers.  For example, `Jigsaw' likes to use a disturbing little ventriloquist dummy as his avatar while communicating with his victims.  He can also be quite flamboyantly dressed, with a huge, shimmery red or black cloak and a bizarre mask.  There's really no explanation why he would choose to be like that, he just does, because the filmmakers thought it would be cool or scary.  Though the film is very dark and grisly it isn't extremely gory.  Much of the violence is shown fairly obscurely or not at all, but what happens is conceptually nasty enough that it is plenty effective even without being given a close, detailed view.  What gore there is is generally fairly well done, particularly considering the budget they had.<br /><br />As I keep saying, this film has great scenes, even if they doesn't always make all that much sense.  Most notably, the whole setup is just great, I think.  Convoluted and highly, highly unlikely, but great.  Some specifics:  A particularly effective scene is when we see the ordeal of Jigsaw's one surviving victim, who had to dig a key out a man intestinal track in order to remove a giant metal device from her heard, which is set to rip her jaws apart if she takes too long.  Similarly excellent is the scene where Adam is abducted, as he wanders about his powerless apart, randomly taking pictures to provide a small, brief bit of illumination.  And, the climax, while I cant go into specifics, is really very intense and grisly.  A very effective closing the the film.<br /><br />Despite what anyway may tell you, the acting in this film is perfectly serviceable.  No, it isn't first-rate, and they occasionally blow some lines, but most of the time it's at least passable.  And anyone who really has that big of a problem with the acting doubtless isn't much of a horror fan, so who cares what they think.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Not terribly plausible, but I've never cared about that much anyway.  Virtually everything else works quite well.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Saw was interesting.  I think I was expecting a more senseless out-and-out gore fest and while it is gorey, it pretends to have higher aspirations.  That is actually what kind of diminsihed the film's fun factor for me.  The whole theme about appreciating life, the cat and mouse intrigue were fine - actually it then raised my expectations for the film.  The problem is that after that, the script gets a little sloppy.  The ending is quite frustrating and just a little too silly given the greater depth they had hinted at earlier.  Some fine scary moments and supsense are guaranteed however.<br /><br />Elwes' real accent keeps slipping out toward the end as his anger and fustration mount and numerous folks have pointed out the kill-him-while-you-have-him gaffe that occurs multiple times.  Both annoying factors as the film moves along.  Still, it can be a fun ride for thriller people.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>There were some things that didn't make sense in this movie. For starters, the Asian cop who was killed in that house of horrors. You would think there would be a major criminal investigation in that place. But no. Nothing. And why did they go alone instead of calling for backup? That didn't make sense. Another thing, we're to believe these people are being put through all this because of something bad they've done in their lives but the two main characters in the film who are chained up have done nothing wrong. The doctor was going to have an affair but he didn't. The other guy who works at the hospital...well there weren't any questions answered about him. I can't bring up the biggest problem in the movie without giving the ending away. All in all, the movie was all right. I liked the set up but it lacked suspense and the plot just didn't make sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Saw is a movie that starts out stylish and smart and gets silly and dumb before it ends. When watching the beginning and middle I thought "how could Richard Roeper call this one of the worse movies of 2004". Then as it gets closer to the end I thought "ok I get it now, that's why". Carey Elwes (Kiss the Girls) gives about the same bad performance that Kim Basinger did on Cellular. It's overly dramatic and just laughable. Still entertainly laughable at least.<br /><br />  Anyway the movie is about a killer who gets people to kill themselves trying to escape. They are people who have wanted to kill themselves and he gets them to fight to try to live. The movie is entertaining through-out even if it does lose it's touch a little at the end. It starts out as a good mystery/horror film and becomes just  laughably bad entertaining at the end.  Still it is a lot better than most recent horror films that came out recently.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Pardon my theft from a classic Easy Money line, but this movie just plain stunk. Saw is a Seven clone but without the heart, soul or intensity of the original psychological thriller. Saw tries in every way to mimic the better aspects of Fincher's masterpiece, the ultra-quick cuts, the psycho who's fed up with the wrongs of society and the no win choice that the main character of this film is left with. Cary Elwes plays Lawrence, a middle aged surgeon who is married with a small daughter. Elwes just doesn't have the grit needed to pull off this grimy, dirty, angry role. He's too much of a pretty boy and you can see right through his rantings and ravings as ultra-scripted. The plot twists a number of times but the ending has to rank among the worst I've ever seen. It leaves the viewer angry and feeling hollow, besides this, lots of loose ends are never tied up. The premise is what drew me to the film certainly not the star power (or lack of star power for that matter) eventhough Danny Glover does play a cop in search of the killer. Saw is late night cable fare at best and a poor imitation of an original idea (Seven). Not Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This film could have been so much better. As a die hard horror fan I thought this movie had a lot to offer. The story although it borrowed from Seven was still fairly interesting, and the mood was very creepy. The acting however, particulary in the last act falls completely apart. In the theater everyone started laughing that's how bad it got. It's really a shame though, this one had potential. A true blue horror film with an R rating and no cutesy teens. I've heard that much of the acting sucked because the budget didn't allow for any second takes and most of what made it into the film were more like practice takes than real takes. It's really a shame that a jackass like Michael Bay can secure millions for junk like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon, and the creators of Saw couldn't even finish their movie the right way.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Two men, Leigh Whannell and James Wan, obviously had a lot of time on their hands when creating the now breakthrough film that redefined what Horror really is; "Saw".<br /><br />The story goes about when two strangers find themselves trapped in a mysterious room chained from the leg to the wall.<br /><br />Now, for a plot as simple as that, the creativity has room to grow and even to pulsate with ingenious gimmicks and clever plot twists.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about this movie is the fact that it started out dark and began to open up more, almost like it was giving birth to the new creative side of franchise horror, introducing you to the new baddie that will take the place of Freddie Kruger, Jason Vorhees, and the Seven Killer. In fact, one would say that the tone of the movie has a slighly "Se7enish feel."<br /><br />The good part is that that doesn't take away from the excitement or the suspense. Along the way, the film educates you on the one holding them hostage and his method of killing. The Killer, apparently called Jigsaw, wants the victim's to figure out the puzzles of the death game that he has created. There are several ways to escape but all of them are either preconceived or pre-thout out ahead of time in where the chances of survival and escaping are both on a very jagged plane.<br /><br />I'd say that this movie finally captures what every other director was trying to do with modern day Horror. I'll go one step further and say that this movie Re-invented the Horror franchise. And, for a first try, debut film, these two filmakers really raise the bar higher than ever anticipated.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this film if you are a hardcore horror/thriller fan but also want the thinking that goes along with it, as with the Movie Seven.<br /><br />I saw this movie when it first came out around Halloween and let me tell you that this Franchise did something Newer, Bolder, and that they have invented a new Franchise for the Horror fans in need. You ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM!!!<br /><br />IT'S GREAT!!!!<br /><br />I GIVE IT TEN STARS!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Actor-writer Leigh Whannel stars with Cary Elwes and Danny Glover in this horror-thriller in the vein of Seven. Newcomer James Wan takes on the directing duties for this ambitious, but flawed film called Saw. Financed by Lions Gate Films which is quickly earning the reputation for taking chances on small, low-budget horror films that other major studios and their independent house won't touch.<br /><br />Saw succeeds in creating a palpable dread and tension as the character of Adam (Whannel) and Lawrence (Elwes in scenery-chewing mode) wake up with no memory of how they got into chained-up in adingy and dimly lit shower room. Slowly the two characters try to figure out why they've been chained into pipings in the room. Soon ehough a tape recorded message informs them of the situation they're in and all of it due to demented criminal who the press and the police have dubbed Jigsaw. The premise of their incarceration is simple. Jigsaw wants them to play a game where they must find clues and tools hidden around the room and escape from just in time to save Lawrence's wife and daughter. This premise and the reasoning as to why they must play this game is one of this film's strong points, but it also becomes one of its flaws as the Whannel overwrites the dialogue into trying to explain everything through the Elwes character. Whannel as a writer doesn't seem to trust his audience to solve or even understand the premise and Jigsaw. Unlike Seven which gives just enough hints and clues for people to try and solve the problem, Saw pretty much tries to give everything away. Fortunately, the story in convoluted and twisty enough that the audience might be confused by the time Elwes character over-explains everything. Saw is the kind of film that surely would've benefitted from the concept of less is more.<br /><br />The acting is average to say the least with Elwes chewing up every scene he's in. It's hard to gauge whether Elwes' performance was due to the pedestrian script he had to read from or if he thought that was what the character needed. Either way his character dominated the film even in scenes when he should've stayed in the background. Whannel as an actor is believable enough and probably a level better than as a writer. Though he was abit too subdued, but then that might've been due to the fact he had to act opposite of the over-the-top Elwes. Danny Glover makes an appearance as a burned-out cop whose earlier run-in with Jigsaw led to his partner's death and him scarred for life. Glover's seems to barely register in the film and his character seems abit tacked on to give the story an added dimension to make it complex. Horror films should really try to stay simple.<br /><br />Saw does deliver in the gore department, but not overly much. It just had enough squirm-inducing scenes in the beginning, middle and end chapters to make the film worthwhile to fans of R-rated horror. This film will not be mistaken for one of the PG-13 Japanese ghost remakes of the last five years. As stated earlier this film owes alot more to Fincher's Seven than to Nakata's Ringu series. The quick frantic beginning makes way for a middle part where too much talking and not enough horror sequences. Fortunately, the pacing speeds up once more in the last 10-15 minutes as Jigsaw's game and manipulations come to a bloody and twisted end.<br /><br />One thing to mention as a stand-out character even though he's only on the screen a limited time is the genre actor Tobin Bell who plays Jigsaw with a twisted sense of tragic nobility. As much as Jigsaw may be the demented creator of the game and trap Adam and Lawrence have been put in, it was very difficult not to admire Bell's character. He's not on par with Hannibal Lector, but he has that potential to be one of the classic cinematic villains.<br /><br />In the end, Saw was a good enough horror movie for fans of the genre. Though casual horror fans may be more shocked with the film's scenes and premise than hardened horror-aficionados. Saw could've been very good or great if not for its overexplanation of everything going on in the scene and the average acting performance of most of the cast. Tobin Bell's performance being the only real highlight of the entire group. The ending of Saw seems well-suited for sequels. I wouldn't mind seeing what new complex game Jigsaw has in mind for a new set of unworthies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>When I went to go see "Saw" late last night I was thinking "saw" as the past tense of see and not "saw" as the noun ("a hand or power tool or a machine used to cut hard material and equipped usually with a toothed blade or disk") or as the verb ("to cut with a saw"). What was I thinking? "Saw" is in the Grand Guignol of "Seven" and "The Bone Cutter," and apparently had to make some last minute cuts to avoid getting saddled with a NC-17 rating. That alone with give you an indication of what first time director James Wan and first time writer Leigh Whannell were going for in "Saw," even with only $1.2 million to make the film and 18 days to shoot it.<br /><br />Adam (Leigh Whannell), a young man, wakes up underwater in a dark room with a chain around his ankle. He is not alone, and when the light come on he finds himself is what appears to be a long abandoned public restroom. At the other end is Lawrence (Cary Elwes), who is also chained to a pipe. On the floor in between them, out of their reach, is the corpse of a man who apparently killed himself with a gun. In his hand is a tape recorder. After becoming oriented to his strange surroundings, Adam discovers a plastic bag in his pocket, containing an envelope. Inside is a key and a small cassette tape with the words "Play Me." Let the game begin.<br /><br />Beyond that you really do not want to know that much about this before you see it, and given the dreck that passes for horror thrillers in recent years "Saw" is worth the seeing in the theater. The last time I actually went to see a film in this genre in a theater was probably "Hannibal," and I have not had any reason to regret being selective in this regard. However, this is not going to be a date movie, but one for hardcore fans of the genre who prefer their DVD editions to be the director's unrated cut of the film. "Saw" is a film that works more in the world of horror films than it does in the real world, but that is certainly part for the genre at this point.<br /><br />The entire film does not take place in the abandoned restroom, although that is main arena. Lawrence knows something about the "Jigsaw Killer," who has been constructing elaborate dances of death in which his victims have to try and save themselves. Only one victim has survived to date (Shawnee Smith), so it is possible to get out of this alive, just extremely difficult and we are treated to a couple of examples of where it did not go as well. Investigating the case are a couple of detectives, Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), and the chronology of the film gets skewed as the present and the past become confused. The game also involves more than the two men chained to the wall, because Lawrence's wife, Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter, Diana (Makenzie Vega) are part of it as well.<br /><br />During the film's endgame things are moving fast enough that you probably will not be able to figure out how it will all play out even though "Saw" overplays the obvious red herring card. The film pushes one of my least favorite buttons a couple of time, which is when somebody has a gun on the villain and does not blow them away. If there is one thing we have learned from all of these movies it is that hesitating when you have the bad guy in your sights is never a good thing. I especially go through the roof when a trained law enforcement officer is pointing the gun right at the killer and the killer still gets away (even Clarice Starling is guilty of this sin in "The Silence of the Lambs"). So there is some heavy handedness to Whannell's script that hopefully will be replaced by something more elegant when he and Wan make their recently announced "Saw 2" sequel for 2005.<br /><br />But "Saw" is not an elegant horror film, although Wan gets points for keeping the most horrific moment of the film off screen (even though the rationale is small budget and not true aesthetic choice, which makes me fearful for what will happen when Wan and Whannell have a much bigger budget for the sequel). The "Jigsaw Killer" has a warped interest in having his victims better appreciate their lives, so getting out alive has to do not only with Lawrence and Adam solving the tasks they are given, but also with finding out some important things about each other. The important thing here is that the film's final scene is pretty horrific, even if the film cheats a bit to get to that point, and that even when the screen goes dark and the credits start to roll, Whannell keeps the horror going.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>After consecutively watching the entire Saw series over a recent weekend (and LOVING it), I decided that a single review with modified details could be used for all the films.  Enjoy.<br /><br />A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.<br /><br />Saw ONE begins with THREE people trapped in an abandoned BATHROOM.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John "Jigsaw" Kramer) game, ADAM STANHEIGHT (Leigh Whannell) and DR. LAWRENCE GORDON (Cary Elwes) have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), DET. STEVEN SING (Len Leung), and rugged veteran DAVID TAPP (Danny Glover) are investigating as a team, but DAVID TAPP may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participants learn that ADAM may be an accomplice to their abduction, and their situation provides a choice between a SAW AND A LEG or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead the captives (aka life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.<br /><br />Several previous murderous contraptions like the RAZOR WIRE MAZE (for a CUTTER), and the NAPALM/POISON/GLASS ROOM (for a HYPOCHONDRIAC) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the REVERSE BEAR TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S MIND, and on to Saw II.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Two men awaken to find themselves chained to thick metal piping at the opposite ends of an old abandoned bathroom. Adam (Leigh Whannell) is a photographer; Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, The Princess Bride) is a surgeon. Both men have no idea how they ended up in this room together. Nor how a dead body laying between them got there. In the dead body's hands are a gun and a micro-cassette tape player.<br /><br />They soon discover a micro-cassette tape in each of their pockets, and quickly uncover a creepy message that awaits them by their captor. The "jigsaw" killer has caught them: a psychopath who doesn't necessarily "kill" people, but helps them kill themselves . . . or survive by killing others.<br /><br />**********************************************************************<br /><br />The psychology surrounding the events is sound enough: the slow descent into suspicion of each other, the lack of external stimulation that leads to a decline in mental faculties, and the eventual near insanity that would insue if you found out you had to kill someone in order to save yourself and/or your loved ones. Do they deserve to die anymore than you do?<br /><br />Where this film fell a bit short was in acting and plot. The acting was subpar. Cary Elwes, who I absolutely LOVED in The Princess Bride, here comes off like an amateur (could be that they were pressed for time and money, filming on a budget of $1.2 million and in 18 days). Makenzie Vega, Elwes' wife in the film, was flat, uncharming, and a bore. As were the estimable Danny Glover (Grand Canyon), and Ken Leung (Rush Hour and Red Dragon).<br /><br />There were also enough plot holes to make this film resemble swiss cheese. There was the fact that the main antagonist turns out to be someone who could NEVER have pulled off such cases (mainly because he was deathly ill); Dr. Gordon was allowed to sit and watch the interrogation of a survivor of the Jigsaw Murderer (which NEVER would have happened if, as the film shows us, Dr. Gordon was an initial suspect); the "game" that is played out by this killer is given to the captives bit by bit, as if it were a simple video game and all you had to do to survive was to put the pieces together. But, what I didn't understand, is that if this psycho enjoyed watching people tear themselves or others apart, why would he give them a way out, with simple clues and instructions? Didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />For the horror fan, though, I'm sure this film will be coveted and hailed as a great film of 2004. For me, though, it's a pretty big disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Sometimes the mind has tunnel vision. But details need to be ingrained.<br /><br />"Saw" is a no bones, graphic crime thriller. Knowing that going into view this film can only lead to predictable assumptions. Who is the Killer? That question is always in the viewer's mind. As a side note: Your first instinct is usually right!<br /><br />Director James Wan plays with those viewer's assumptions. "Saw" is about a sadistic serial killer with a conscience on changing his victim's outlook. This is a great story with many twists and options to play with as a scriptwriter. Will you make a drastic decision to save your life?<br /><br />"Saw" starts out with a great premise but ends with the believable factor. How much time would it take to set up these elaborate scenarios with life choice decisions?  The plot is intertwined in massive coincidence of circumstances. The inept detectives (Danny Glover/Ken Leung) round out the mislead manhunt.  Hopefully the sequel will be better. But worth viewing to find out who is the killer!</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Wow!  Very few times I get suprised, especially in the horror genre.  Then out of nowhere comes a movie that leaves me breathless.  Intense, gory, thrilling, and complex.  This film has it all.  It is like "Se7en" meets "Hannibal."  This movie is twisted, even sick at times.  Just when I thought I knew whats going on, bam!  A new twist.  The ending is top notch.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Well worth seeing twice, to see if you can pick up clues that were missed the first time.  I see a sequel is in the future, hell this could be a new franchise.  Move over Freddy, Chucky and Jason.  There's a new killer in town, and he's smart.

The only way they can escape is by cutting their foot off.<br /><br />good movie, good directing, mediocore acting, and a interesting screenplay</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Simply put, Saw is the best horror movie I've seen in years.  I know some people don't seem to like it, but this horror fan is just wallowing in the bloody effectiveness of this extremely dark, intelligent, gory masterpiece of a film.  It's such a thrill to see something certifiably different make its way to movie screens; these days, Hollywood horror filmmakers have gotten so lazy that they can't even make sequels of films - instead, they just remake old horror films that don't need remaking.  Frankly, I'm a little tired of watching teenagers get slashed up in the woods by rednecks and inbred mutants.  I want something new, something fresh, something bold, something ruthless in its execution, something that engages my intellect while assaulting my senses.  Saw fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />As Saw moves toward its gory denouement, it unleashes a number of great surprises, and the ending is well-nigh perfect - I certainly didn't see it coming.  You may think you know what is going on, but I'll wager that you'll be mistaken.  Best of all, there's no deus ex machina plot device to ruin everything - i.e., as surprising as the final revelations are, everything comes together in a heartbeat to make perfect sense.  I really can't say enough about the script put together by Leigh Wannell and James Wan - it's bloody brilliant.  I love this movie.<br /><br />The Bad Man in Saw is downright sadistic; rather than merely hunt his victims down and kill them himself, he creates elaborate "games" that lead to painful deaths brought about by the participants themselves.  He chooses his victims carefully, selecting only those who are guilty of some "crime" or indiscretion that he feels should no longer go unpunished (and when one former victim won the game, he did in fact let her go - and in one twisted sense, she was better off as a result of having played the game).  The particular game at the centerpiece of the film (which is actually rather mundane compared to some of the killer's previous ones) pits two men together in a filthy underground room and challenges one player to kill the other within a certain time limit if he wants to keep his wife and daughter alive.  That would be Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes); his partner in torturous suffering is a young fellow named Adam (Leigh Wannell).  Both of them wake up in this room without knowing where they are or how they got there.  Our imaginative dark lord of sadism provides the two with some hidden clues and "tools" that do much to keep things really interesting.  Did I mention both men are chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room, and that there's a bloody dead guy lying in the middle of the floor?  Oh, how I wish I could tell you more about what happens, but I wouldn't dare deprive any Saw virgins out there from truly enjoying this magnificent film.<br /><br />I must admit that I expected to see nothing but gore in this movie - mindless, bloody gore.  Certainly, there's gore all over the place, but this is the exact opposite of a mindless thriller.  Yet again, a small-budget film has far surpassed the best horror films Hollywood has to offer, proving once more that a strong and intelligent plot, not gore in and of itself, is the secret for succeeding in this darkest of genres.  Saw is truly a horror film for the ages, the first true horror masterpiece of the 21st century.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Wow, what a horrible movie.  I really mean it.  I haven't seen a movie so bad in such a long time.  An interesting premise and a very well put trailer would lead you to believe that this movie follows in the footsteps of Se7en.  Let me tell you how much of a joke this movie is.  Well, here is the plot, two guys wake up in a bathroom chained up to the wall and are being tormented by the Jigsaw killer.  A madman who actually gets the victims to kill themselves.  Interesting? Yeah it is. So what wen't wrong? Well the number one problem here was the acting, oh my god the acting.  I am going to say it here and now that this movie had some of the worst acting I have ever seen in my life. That goes for you too Danny Glover, shame on you.  You wanna know how bad the acting was? The acting was so bad that the entire audience was laughing at the film's climax, which was supposed to be the tensest scene in the movie.  The dialogue was so utterly horrible, so laughable. This movie follows the same goddamn formula that every psychological thriller does, except here there is absolutely no point to it.  Every psychologocal thriller has a "big twist" at the end, it's a must, but when the twist is the stupidest thing in the movie that has no connection to any of the characters then your movie has failed.  I didn't guess the ending, I knew it was coming, but I didn't figure it out.  The only reason I didn't figure it out was that there were no clues for the audience to pick off of, the plot is so literal and meaningless that they forgot to throw in the meaningful dialogue and visuals. There is only one scene in the movie that would allow you to figure out the ending, but the way it was done was so the filmmaker's made sure that the audience wouldn't pick up on it.  When I go see a thriller I want the filmmakers to outsmart and outwit me so I get a big slap in the face when the end comes and I say to myself "my god why didn't I see that in the first place".  Saw is a case where the filmmakers are too stupid to make a witty and clever plot so they fill it up with gore.  When a movie has a scene where a guy trips on a wire to trigger 6 shotguns to fire onto his head you know that the filmmakers are too stupid to come up with anything else.  This was the biggest joke I have ever seen and I am pissed at myself for going into this movie thinking it would be good.  I'm pissed because I know that the movie's marketing campaign worked on me and I fell victim to it.<br /><br />ACTING: You would see better acting from a blind mime.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Not scary, not disturbing, not fun to watch.  The audience knows exactly where the plot is going except they will have no idea who the killer is because the filmmakers won't allow it, that way they are sure that its a surprise for the audience at the end.  Okay you got the surprise, now what's the purpose? The only scary thing about this movie is the plot and acting.  Not once did I jump, not once was I questioning what will happen, not once was I impressed. If you haven't seen Se7en, then I beg of you to see it. Please see Se7en instead of this meaningless piece of crud.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Saw (James Wan, 2004)<br /><br />The people who are criticizing Saw because Cary Elwes' acting ability breaks down at the end (which is an inaccurate statement in the first place, but oh well) are probably the same ones who criticize Se7en because of Brad Pitt's infamous "what's in the baaaaahhhhhhx?"line. Consider that when trying to decide whether you're going to see it.<br /><br />Saw is the best psychological thriller in years, perhaps since Radha Bharadwaj unleashed the most underrated film of all time, Closetland, on us in 1991. The story concerns a mysterious sadist, known as Jigsaw (because of a distinctive mark left on those whose lives he touches), who cooks up inventive ways for people to kill themselves and applies them to those whose wasted lives they fit with most appropriately. Even saying that much really constitutes a spoiler, explaining how the movie works would be even more of one.<br /><br />I find it all too amusing that the pre-release reviews of the film were overall positive (before it opened, its tomatometer reading at the indispensable Rotten Tomatoes site was 86%) and post-release reviews have been overall negative (as I write this, it sits at 46%). What's even more interesting is that so many of these reviews harp on the gore factor. The movie had two full minutes trimmed in order to get its R rating. I'm still wondering why. Aside from a few uses of the one word guaranteed to give your movie an R rating (cf. the brilliant horror spoof Student Bodies), only one scene in that movie would barely rate above a PG-13, were I voting; aside from that scene, there's nothing in this movie you won't see in an episode of CSI or The Shield. Most of you won't need to hide your eyes, except in one scene. (Close them at the words "Hello, Amanda," and keep them closed for approximately the next three minutes.)<br /><br />As I read through the reviews for this movie, I wonder if they all missed the point. I keep seeing the word "scary," usually in a negative connotation (as in, the word "not" is before it). People, Saw is not a horror film. Se7en was not scary, either, nor was Closetland. The whole point of the movie, as with any mystery, is to lead up to the main plot twist, where you figure out whodunit. And in that regard, Saw excels like no movie since The Usual Suspects. In fact, were it not for that film, I'd have started this review with the words "Best. Ending. Ever." As it stands, it runs a pretty close second.<br /><br />Since so many people in so many places are harping on the acting, this seems a good time to bring it up. Yeah, there's some below-par acting here, especially from Makenzie Vega (The Geena Davis Show), who often seems more like a robot than a girl. Elwes does his job well; what I assume people are talking about when they say "his acting abaility breaks down at the end" is actually about an hour into the movie, when he really starts getting mad. Yeah, it's kind of amusing, and certainly not tense, but then I'm not sure it was meant to be. (If you're really criticizing him for his acting at the end of the movie, I'm wondering if we saw the same movie, or if you realized what condition he was supposed to be in. His acting at the actual end of the film was spot on.) Excellent supporting performances are turned in by screenwriter Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, and a number of others. Special attention should be paid to Shawnee Smith, who's miles away from her amusingly bad performance in the 1988 remake of The Blob. Monica Potter makes appearances, but mostly in the film's weakest moments; she's not really given enough to work with to see what she's capable of.<br /><br />I really wonder if the people who reviewed this film before I got around to it really saw the same movie I did. Maybe they were all lucky enough to see the uncut version. Maybe they're just not used to seeing suspense films that contain gore (which would actually explain a lot of the seeming misinterpretation). Go see it without any preconceptions, expecting a mystery/suspense thriller rather than a horror film, and you will be mighty entertained. **** ?. Originally a ****, but half a point got added for the movie's last two minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Two men are chained up in the bathroom of a filthy abandoned building.

However, the "Saw" series of films are all freightening, hair-raiing, fast paced, involving, and, blood-curdling. The plot is simple: a psychopath named Jigsaw kidnaps people who take their lives for granted and puts them in torture chambers to see who can escape. The "Saw" films are not for the faint of heart, so if you have a weakness for gore these are not for you to view. But, if you want good horror that will scare you out of your seat watch the "Saw" films. I can't say I have a particular version I like the best, for all the sequels are well produced and follow the same formula as the original.

Instead, it became the surprise horror hit of 2004, birthed a new killer icon--the Jigsaw Killer, prompted two sequels (so far), earned over $100 million worldwide, and revived the movie career of Cary Elwes.<br /><br />The film opens in a disgusting, dirty, disused, and probably diseased bathroom with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) chained at opposite ends of the room to pipes by their ankles with an apparent dead man lying between them.  The dead guy holds a tape player and a handgun and each of the men has a tape in their back pocket.  They each play their tapes: one is threatened, but the other isn't.  Dr. Gordon must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and daughter will die.  The men discover hacksaws in a toilet, but fail to cut through their chains.  Time is running out.  Meanwhile, Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) is hunting Jigsaw as the movie flashbacks to scenes showing some of Jigsaw's other victims.  Jigsaw wears a giant puppet head and he never actually kills his victims himself.  Instead, he forces them to kill themselves or to kill each other, the whole time watching his little "game" which he believes is a public service to set people free (think of a psychotic and murderous Tyler Burden from FIGHT CLUB).  Put it all together and it makes for one bizarre movie.<br /><br />Personally, I found SAW to be better than I had expected it to.  The idea of a gamemaster who doesn't actually kill anyone himself but lets them do what he wants them to, is an interesting concept.  Danny Glover is a pleasure to watch on film and it was nice to see Cary Elwes again, even if his performance was terrible.  There's a lot of blood and guts in the film, though much of it has been toned down through editing and lighting, yet there are some things that the filmmakers leave up to one's imagination.<br /><br />Overall, even though SAW is pretty much an average horror flick, it has enough sparks of originality to make it one cut above the rest.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>These two guys wake up chained up on opposite ends of a dirty utility room.  Whoever chained them up was brilliant, because the hand saw they are given doesn't cut through metal, but goes through flesh and bone.  They wonder why they're there.  One is calmer than the other.  In the room with them, there's a dead body, and in each of the hands there is a tape player and a handgun.  The two guys each have a tape with instructions on what to do in order to stay alive.  The madman behind all this is nicknamed Jigsaw, and he put his victims in these situations so to show them how precious life is.  In his eyes, people are killing themselves with drugs and whatnot that they don't take time to appreciate their own lives and what they got.  As the movie goes on, we, the audience find out information on the two guys.  One of the guys is a doctor and doesn't spend enough time at home with his wife and daughter.  The other is a photographer who, throughout the movie, we find out that he's been secretly taking pictures of the doctor.<br /><br />This movie isn't as scary as I thought it would have been, but it is pretty disturbing and intense.  I'm pretty good at watching blood, but when the part where he had to saw his own leg off to free himself from the chain, I had to cover my eyes.  This movie made me think a lot.  Life is too short, and this movie will tell you to savor each breath you take.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>Saw is a must see for any fan of horror movies. I've been hard-pressed to find a truly horrifying horror movie over the last few years, and finally they give us Saw. It was worth the wait. It's mentally thrilling as well as full of gore, particularly if you get the uncut version, which I wish I'd waited for but I'm just too impatient. The uncut version has a cooler cover but it also has more gore to it. After viewing the uncut version (which my best friend has) it was easy to see why they cut some of those scenes to make it more movie-friendly for those who are too squeamish. You'll have a lot of fun trying to figure out the game in this movie, and when the ending comes you'll be quite surprised. At least I was. I made my best friend check all my closets after this one, but if I told you why it would give away the ending. Not just recommended...mandatory for horror fans everywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>I expected this to be just another slasher film with unnecessary nudity and people running upstairs instead of down. But, it's actually nothing like that surprisingly. This is a fresh feel to a horror movie, probably seen before, but hasn't been done to death over the past few years.<br /><br />The movie starts off a bit confusing, but you pick up on whats going on. It starts off showing the two main actors, already stuck in their prison that the villain has placed them in. They're locked in chains, have no idea how they got there and don't know what is going on. As it goes on, they find these sort of clues, and have to solve little riddles or something while a clock is running down. If they run out of time, pay the consequences. Also it follows a story of an ex-cop played by Danny Glover who is on the hunt for the "Jigsaw" killer. During the movie there are flashbacks to things the main actors are remembering from their pasts, trying to remember how they got into the situation they are in, what they had heard, who they thought it was, who they where etc...<br /><br />It's hard to say anything really without giving away the whole deal. So I'll just say, this an interesting movie because every-time you think you predict something, you don't! Plus it's interesting that the killers actions aren't murder, he puts his victim in a situation where if they want to live, they must make sacrifices to stay alive.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Saw is a good movie. It's suspenseful, gory, and keeps your attention. At the end you'll be wondering what happened, and will have to rewind. The only thing is that it doesnt fully live up to its hype.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Word of warning to start things off:  NOT FOR KIDS!!!  Not only is the movie rated "R," it is quite grizzly.  While not unusually "graphic," it is unusually disturbing.  The creators have gone out of their way to concoct disquieting deaths and some pretty disquieting ideas.  It's the kind of movie where at the end you have to kinda wonder what kind of sick mind came up with this stuff.<br /><br />If you liked SE7EN, you might like this too.  That's the movie it's most often compared with, but that's not quite fair.  It's seedy, like much of SE7EN, but it doesn't have a Hollywood gloss on it. For all it's deranged ideas, SE7EN had a sheen of respectability brought to it by the presence of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow...all comfortable, well-known, attractive actors.  Not much of that in SAW!<br /><br />It deals with a serial-killer who isn't really.  The crazy person in this film concocts extremely elaborate ways to get his hostages to kill themselves.  One victim, for example, is told she can save herself by unlocking the huge device on her head, which, when a timer goes off, will essentially rip her head in half.  To unlock the device, she must retrieve the key from her cellmate.  Or rather, her cellmate's stomach.<br /><br />The killer watches all the shenanigans from lots of hidden cameras and such, and communicates in taped recordings that distort his voice.  We've seen all that sort of stuff before.  The cop who is chasing the bad guy (Danny Glover) is obsessed with his work, to the point where his sanity loosens and he loses his job.  Hardly original either.<br /><br />What DOES work in the film is the central scene (which feels almost like a play) where two men wake up in a most horrifically filthy abandoned public restroom somewhere.  They are chained around the ankle to thick pipes and cannot reach each other.  In the middle of the room lies a previous victim, a man who has apparently shot  himself in the head and left quite a mess on the floor.  Each man discovers a taped recording with instructions, telling them how to survive.  The main character, played by Cary Elwes (oh, how far the star of PRINCESS BRIDE has fallen), is a doctor who has been told that his wife and daughter are being held hostage, and that they can only have there freedom if Elwes kills his cellmate.  Oh, and each man has a hacksaw...not strong enough to cut the chains, but perfect for sawing off a foot to get free of the chains.  Nice, huh?<br /><br />Well, I have to admit that as the men acted out their little scenario throughout the film (the rest of the backstory is told in flashbacks) I was intrigued.  It carried a lurid fascination.  And the resolution of the film, while a bit pat, was surprising and twisty.  We think we know who the villain is...but do we?<br /><br />So, the pluses are there:  it's a compelling story (although we feel a little unclean watching it), has some surprises and has an over-the-top art direction and cinematography that is admirable in its fearlessness.<br /><br />On the down side: the acting is pretty uneven.  Glover really has nothing to work with and poor Elwes...in the past, he has done an American accent quite convincingly, but in this movie, it gets away from him time and again...lapsing into British pronunciations just enough to be quite distracting.  The young man who is the doctor's cellmate is played by screenwriter Whannel, and he comes across as a guy who's maybe done a little acting in college for fun...he's got energy, but no subtlety.  Monica Potter plays Elwes wife, and she's a cipher too.  The movie isn't terribly interested in its characters...just its situations.  And for the most part, that's good enough.  This is no SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  If the filmmakers aspired to that...they missed the boat.  If they aspired to achieve everything that the execrable FEAR DOT COM missed, then I think they did okay.  The movie shows some originality, but it feels a bit rushed.  No doubt the filmmakers were given a pretty tight budget and schdule.  Parts of it feel scotch-taped together...tug too hard and it'll all fall apart.  You don't want to think about this one too hard.<br /><br />Who to recommend it to:  filmgoers who don't mind being a little uncomfortable in exchange for some serial-killer / sicko thrills.  If you like stuff like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SE7EN and that ilk, you'll probably be okay with this film.  If you're squeamish, like your murders tidy, then stay away.  And again, if you're a parent, please keep your young kids away.  When I saw the film, there were about 10 little children in the audience, and I felt bad for them.  They'll remember (and dream about) the disturbing images...but won't actually understand what happened.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>For my part, it was quite an impulsive move to view "Saw".  I had no real pre-conceived ideas beyond having heard that it was similar to "Seven".<br /><br />Although I can only give the film 4 stars, I can recommend it to all viewers of crime thrillers.  The reason for not offering a further star is that, upon reflection, the plot is perhaps too far fetched.  That point aside, the film was truly chilling.<br /><br />In brief, two men are chained together in a filthy basement toilet area.  They each have a saw although the saw is only sufficient to sever a limb and not adequate for braking their chains.  If they cannot escape within about 8 hours they will be killed.<br /><br />Through a series of flashbacks, the viewer is able to piece together a series of horrible murders that are all connected.  The connection is both the horror of the crime and the fact that the victims have a link with a local hospital.  Yet, it is only at the film's end that we come to learn who is the mastermind of the murders.  It is at this point, however, that the plot becomes somewhat implausible.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings about the plot, "Saw" is excellent drama that will keep all viewers on the edge of their seats.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>I wouldn't exactly call this "horror" as much as a crime film, since there's no supernatural element in at all.  Whatever Wan was originally going for with this strange little piece, it really is a double edged sword: while lacking the power of "Seven" or "Silence of the Lambs", it has a more interesting psychopath at the base of the events than any of them.  Although we never find out who the "Jigsaw Killer" really is or about his life (other than that he is dying), his "morals" are very existential and go above and beyond the dimestore psychology of such people we are offered in most movies: "something in happened in his/her childhood, he/she is repeating the pattern, etc".  Nothing like that.<br /><br />I was misled about this film: it does NOT take place in one room.  Most of the important parts which compose the real plot<br />take place outside of the dirty utility room the men wake up in.  This is no cinematic experiment. Leigh Whannel, who wrote the film, plays Adam, one of the two who gets thrown in the proverbial pan along with Cary Elwes, who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon.  One would think that if Whannel cared enough to write this very complex story, he would have done a much better of job of acting in it. At times the acting and one liners were so bad that you would think these guys were trying out for a part in a high school play.<br /><br />The real substance of the film lies elsewhere, though. The Jigsaw Killer is a particularly volatile and concealed psychopath with a point to prove more legitimate than most of his serial killer peers: he thinks people should appreciate life while they have it.  From this he reasons that putting them in the most horrendous situations (like locking a drug addicts' head into a time-bomb-vice and leaving her to find the key might make her appreciate her face more) might shock them out of their complacency.  I don't if this is what Wan was trying to do, but I found most of the "protagonists" so boring and annoying that you're just itching to know more about the killer--the only character who isn't one dimensional.<br /><br />Some of the symbolism is unforgettable: the really deranged puppet the killer has popping up at crucial moments, and the Samurai-esque costume he wears when on the attack.  The scene in which Danny Glover (who does little but sweat, obsess and get his throat cut) and his partner happen upon Jigsaw "in the act" and the aftermath is so sadistic and gruesome that some people in the theatre screamed.<br /><br />The ending, though, is the big shocker.  This isn't a masterpiece, but it approaches one.  Worth buying when it comes to DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>Overall Saw was a decent movie I just wish that the lead role would have been given to someone else, Carl just couldn't get that emotion across for some reason and it took something away from the movie.<br /><br />The story and irony of of this film were great, it also had some pretty good gore along with some genuinly scary scenes,but,<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD-KEEP CARL EWLES OUT OF HORROR/THRILLER FILMS!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I'm probably going to get my share of flack from others on this site after they read this review, but I'm going to voice my opinion anyway.  I'm being completely honest in everything I say here.  I just viewed this earlier today at my local theater and it has to be the biggest letdown for me out of all the movies that I have seen this year.  To me, Saw has a weak and uninteresting plotline with a bunch of horrific actors weaved into it.  Cary Elwes was completely unconvincing in this picture (I've never seen him in others, so I'm only going by his performance here) When the film first started, I wasn't getting into it then, but I decided to wait it out, hoping that things would pick up by mid picture, but sadly to report, it did not.  I wasn't scared at all, I was disinterested.  I was so bored, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.  I wasn't the only one.  I was the only one left in the theater because everyone was walking out (I never walk out of films, but I REALLY wanted to).  I heard one comment as a dad and his son were exiting: "this is too long." I also agree, what was shown here could have been accomplished in less than an hour and forty minutes.  The concept of using Jigsaw to freak people out may work with young kids, but it didn't work with me.  I was completely unaffected by this picture, psychological thriller/horror or whatever genre would be the appropriate placing for this.  I did get the message out of this as some people are stating in their reviews, but did they really have to put it in such an overrated and dreadful film? I think this movie gives psychological thrillers a bad name.  I've seen some exceptionally wonderful films in that genre, including One Hour Photo.  I wouldn't recommend this picture to anyone, rental or otherwise.  I firmly believe it's a big waste of money and time.  It sure was for me, at least.  I had to chuckle to myself when "game over" was said-I was counting my lucky stars that I didn't have to sit through that "game" any longer. I've never seen any of the movies that this has been compared to (mostly speaking of Seven here) but I'm sure those movies are much better in storyline and acting than this (I honestly doubt it could be worse)</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>A very effective horror movie.  It proves that you don't need a huge budget to create a scary movie.  There are certainly flaws, but they are easily overshadowed by what is good.  The new uncut version is very similar to the original, but does contain more gore, and some new music.  Lots of nice special features and commentaries make this a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Director James Wan and writer (and star) Leigh Whannel met each other at Australia, where they developed their friendship.  They established friendship there, and made this film, which has been picked up the marverick indie company Lions Gate Films for Holloween release.<br /><br />Now, the premise is intriguing.  Two guys are chained (literally) to the walls of a filthy disused restroom, both apart from each other, and in between them lies an apparently dead body soaked in blood.  They cannot untie the chain, and the room is perfectly sealed.  It's the beginning of the game, set by the serial killer called 'Jigsaw.!<br /><br />And two guys, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Wannel himself) try to figure out how to get out of this place.  Obviouly the third person has hidden the clues there as to the escape, or the reasons for their predicament.  And they will see that if they fail to do something by the time appointed, they must stay there for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />Intersting, isn't it?  The film often gives very intense moments (which include gore and violence) but the sad thing is that the script cannot hold the initial tension for long.  If you imagine the film like 'Cube' (in which the camera does not leave the cubic areas), you are mistaken, for the camera goes out of it, to show us other characters like Danny Glover's cop who chases the murderer, or Monica Potter as poor doctor's wife.<br /><br />And that's the problem, for in spite of the occasional intense moments, the film fails to use its premise to the full.  It unwisely includes the incredible coincidences and unexplained (or inconvincing) motive of the character(s), especially that of the killer.  Frankly, I don't believe it.  Compared with this, the killer of 'Se7en' is more plausible.<br /><br />Plus the opinions will divide about the ending, which is full of impact, I admit, but after a while you might start to think, 'Can this person really do that?' or 'Is this person (I mean, the killer) capable of doing that, chaining the two perfectly heathy guys?'  Sorry, but I don't believe that either.<br /><br />Anyway, as a thriller, it is done with a certain flair for visuals, and the filmmakers' guts to tuckle the morbid material should not be dismissed.  But if you ask me whether or not 'Saw' deserves the extensive national release it will receive, I say, No.  It is good, just good.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>"SAW", Is one of the smartest, most<br /> intellegant and well thought out films<br /> of the modern day (American) horror<br /> genre, like most american horror films<br /> at this point in time it loads up on<br /> the blood & guts BUT, what alot of<br /> people dont pay any attiontion to is<br /> that their is a much more deeper<br /> meaning than the basic blah, blah,<br /> villian cuts a little hear, maybe a<br /> little their yada,yada so on and so<br /> forth.

I mean, it had a micro-budget and just over two weeks shooting time! How many recent "horror" movies have come and gone, costing zillions of dollars and taking months to complete, only to stink up our theaters? I like it when unknown directors come along and give us movies that ignore the hollywood formula of $$$ + HYPE - ORIGINALITY = $$$$$$ (like: Night Of The Living Dead, Dementia 13, Carnival Of Souls, Spider Baby, The -original- Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Donnie Darko, May, etc.). SAW actually held my interest throughout, and genuinely shocked me at the end. Remember how the ending in SE7EN made you feel? I sure do, and SAW made me feel that same wonderful mix of dread and amazement! Any flaws can be easily excused considering the aforementioned budget and time constraints. Just watch it and enjoy it...</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>"Saw" is a creepy low budget film with high wattage actors. It promises to deliver tense moments and it does. Several reviewers have stated that it puts up one too many red herrings and, you know, maybe that's true, but frankly I love that stuff - I eat up Agatha Christy-type story lines. And this is somewhat in that vein - just extremely gory.<br /><br />A couple of guys who don't know each other wake up in a disgusting bathroom (I think it's the one that Ewan McGregor went toilet diving in Trainspotting...)chained to the walls. The corpse of someone who blew his own brains out lies between them. They can't free themselves unless one or both of them can saw off his leg using a saw provided by their tormentor (yes, they try it on the chains first to no avail).  Provided with piecemeal clues, the men try to devise a way out of their prison, only to find that if they don't do exactly as their tormentor has stated one of the man's family will be murdered.<br /><br />The cast includes Cary Elwes (Princess Bride and Twister), Danny Glover (do you really need help here?), Monica Potter, and a few unknowns (one of whom wrote the story).<br /><br />The acting is well above par for such a film. The film is sufficiently claustrophobic when it needs to be and expands outside to give us a bit of breathing room only to reel us back in for more.<br /><br />If you have a stomach for some gore and a few really good thrills, check this film out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>TWO MEN [CARY ELWES AND LEIGH WANNELL] BOTH WAKE UP IN A MYSTERIOUS ROOM WITH A MAN WHO'S KILLED HIMSELF.

Not because I was afraid it would be gross, but because I've long since lost any interest of watching horror movies with an audience; movie horror audiences tend to be loud, scream at stupid things, and otherwise just plain irritating to anyone who wants to actually, ya know...enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Someone finally lent me Saw (thanks Matt!), so my wife and I got the chance to see it. This becomes problematic when you talk about the film to other people.  "Did you see Saw?" "I saw Saw."  "You saw what?" "I said I saw Saw." "Stop repeating yourself..." You get the picture.<br /><br />Anyway, the plot begins with Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) waking up in a nasty-looking bathroom.  A dead guy is in the center, apparently having blown his brains out.  In one hand is a gun, in the other a tape recorder.  Eventually, our two protagonists discover they have a tape in their pocket, and a lot more in common than they think.<br /><br />The first half of the movie unfolds in flashbacks as Gordon explains who they're up against.  Their nemesis is the serial killer known as Jigsaw.  Only he doesn't technically kill people; Jigsaw makes his victims kill themselves or each other. Jigsaw is a genius on the level of a Batman villain, a master of puppeteering, trap making, and disguise.<br /><br />If you've seen Se7en, you've seen most of what Saw's all about: the dark blue/green lens, the ever-present filth and grime, the weary black detective (in this case, Danny Glover). The difference is that Jigsaw's violent morality plays are considerably more contrived.<br /><br />That said, this is a film that revels as much in the psychological horror of the human condition as it does in gore.  What are you willing to do to save your life?  And assuming you're a paragon of morality...what would you do to save the lives of your family? Finding out how our protagonists answer those questions is half the fun.<br /><br />The movie has its flaws.  For one, poor Elwes still sounds like a Brit pretending to be an American with an aristocratic accent.  Glover doesn't seem to have much to do but growl.  And Jigsaw is a diabolical genius with a lot of time on his hands.<br /><br />By far Saw's biggest problem is that it's just plain cheap. The supposed car chase looks like two guys pretending to drive cardboard vehicles while making "vroom vroom!" noises.  Blood looks like ketchup.  Weird cut scenes skitter away from anything of substance, cleverly disguising the poor special effects with blinding headaches.  That's what you get for a $1.2 billion budget and an 18-day film shoot.<br /><br />Still, Saw managed to surprise me with its ending.  There's so much going on and so many plot twists that I wasn't expecting the sudden revelation of Jigsaw's identity.<br /><br />Is it gross?  Not really.  Other than the thought of how disgusting some things are, the "wet" factor is it relatively mild.  Is it scary?  Definitely. There's enough gruesome traps and awful choices that one of them is bound to strike a nerve with every viewer, enough to make your skin crawl.  In that respect, Saw is a resounding success.<br /><br />See Saw.  There, I said it.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Saw is a horror movie released last year that certainly delivers.

It certainly has its faults as does every movie but it is a genius horror movie compared to the rest of them.<br />First off, most of what happens in the movie is effective. It opens with two men in a room, chained to posts. They don't know each other. Information is left telling them that one of them needs to kill the other in a certain amount of time or his family will be killed. Soon, they realize that they've been abducted by the Jigsaw Killer, a highly insane madman. Meanwhile, detectives are investigating his murders and are trying to find the newest victims before it's too late for them.<br />The movie packs chills a plenty and some scenes will make you grossed out. For a horror movie, it's in the top 5 I've ever seen; for a regular movie, it still is a very good movie worth the watch.<br />The ending has a huge twist that was geniously conceived and worth the watch alone. Everything clicks right though in this movie that is simply a must see. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel but I doubt that it will be able to surpass this movie.<br />So this Halloween, rent Saw, check it out and then watch the sequel which I'm sure will be great.<br />The ending in my opinion is one of the best ever in horror movies and really came out of nowhere and it will make you view the movie differently every time you will see it.<br />Now for the real review...This movie is in my opinion better than all of the Hannibal movies. Why? Because this movie is very entertaining. It is obvious that it was a low budget movie but this plot is genius. The whole time, you're on the edge of your seat. You're like on a roller coaster ride..and when you think that it will slow down, it just keeps on going until at the end when the roller coaster just blows up. The ending is to me the best I've ever seen. Look how genius it is. Don't tell me any of you thought of it! Sure the Silence of the Lambs has better acting but really..this movie is splendid and really entertaining. I loved it and now own it because it's a one of kind movie regarded by most as your average horror flick but it's not..like Identity, this movie becomes more than a horror movie..it becomes an excellent movie..a smart thriller with great thrills and twists that is worthy to add to your collection. So please don't regard this as your typical so so horror movie that you might want to rent for Halloween. Because what you will find here if you look a little closer is a geniously thought out movie that is trully one of a kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>Good movie doesnt really get boring which is a good thing. But in a sense it is a bite off of "SEVEN" and some other movie but i cant remember. I wont go into detail but, its an ok movie. Im a big fan of 70's and 80's horror some 60's a majority of my collection horror atleast is like I said 70' and 80's so alot of this new stuff does not appeal to me much, at all. I did buy it from best buy cause it was only $14.99 whcih is not bad and I will watch it again from time to time on rare occasion, i more or less really brought just because I like to collect DVD's and it is good enough to buy. If you want a movie with a similar plaot and IMO just way better ,Buy the movie "SEVEN" which is one of the newer late 90 movies that i actually think is an excellentaction/thriller/horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>Saw functions on two levels, as a serial killer thriller and a psychological horror film. It achieves success in both areas, and is actually a good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe. While hardly a great movie, it is good for it's genre, and should appeal to it's fans.<br /><br />The movie opens with two characters, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and nondescript young Joe-everyman Adam (Leigh Whannell), waking up in some dingy forgotten bathroom, chained to the walls with a dead body lying between them. We soon learn, well ahead of the main protagonists, that they are the victims of a serial killer known as "Jigsaw", known for his unusual MO of having his victims kill themselves somehow. To elaborate on that would be giving too much away. Both men discover that they are in danger, and they must work together to find their way out, otherwise Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter will die, and they will rot in their "prison". Added to the mix is the disgruntled cop (Danny Glover) who has personal reasons for finding the serial killer, who basically adds filler to the story that would otherwise be too short for a feature length movie. While Saw borrows from more prominent serial killer movies, especially Seven, it does have some unique twists and clever fright scenes. Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere. The dank bathroom and the spooky interior settings make this movie very unsettling, while the more visceral horror works on a more psychological level.<br /><br />Saw works on the whole, but it is not without flaws. For starters, a good plot doesn't necessarily mean a good script. The dialogue, written by star Leigh Whannell, it totally banal and stilted, and it makes the screenplay seem very much like the work of an amateur. Next, the acting is less than first rate. Whannell is not bad, but Elwes is definitely out of his element in this movie. While he is not known as great actor, he has done much better than this before. However, my biggest problem is with the Danny Glover character, the clich&eacute;d "bitter cop out for revenge" subplot that has been done to death, and it adds nothing of value to this movie.<br /><br />Despite it's shortcomings, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience. The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>What a great choice for a rental for this weekend!<br /><br />When Saw was released, it got mixed reviews.

It eventually turned out to be a far different film that I ever thought, being far more of a psychological thriller than the crazed, serial/slasher film that it seemed to be advertised as being.<br /><br />Saw opens with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) being held captive in a dingy, grimy, foul, and mold infested bathroom.  The bathroom from hell, literally.  They are both chained by the ankle to pipes at opposite ends of the bathroom, neither one knowing how they got there or why.  Between them lies a corpse, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.  They each find a micro-cassette in their pocket as a voice ridicules them as to the reason they are held captive.  Gordon is told he must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and child will be killed.  They also find two hacksaws...too weak to cut through their chains, Gordon realizes they are for cutting through their own ankles if the want to be free.<br /><br />Through flashbacks told by Gordon, we learn of a maniac called the Jigsaw killer.  He plays a deadly game with people, putting them in horrific traps with a small chance of escape where they usually end up killing themselves.  But who is he and why is he doing this?  We learn that Gordon himself was a suspect and investigated by detectives including Tapp (Danny Glover).  Tapp eventually is dismissed from the force when he becomes obsessed with Gordon after his partner is killed by the Jigsaw Killer.<br /><br />Saw is a heavy-handed thriller/horror.  The killer has his warped, moralistic reasons for doing what he does such as trapping a prostitute in a mask that will rip her face apart unless she locates the key for the trap inside the stomach of a corpse.  The Killer seemingly goes after victims who don't have a greater appreciation for life and this does somewhat give away a major plot surprise as James Wan simply was not subtle enough to handle it more deftly.<br /><br />Elwes and Whannell give fine performances as the two men driven to the edge of sanity by their ordeal and one wishes that more time was spent building the tension between the two, rather than with so many flashback scenes.  It is in this dark, dank cell where the movie is at it's best.  Being in a place like this would make anyone cringe and run screaming.  Being held captive there would be one's own private hell.<br /><br />If SaW is guilty of one thing it's perhaps that it tries to be a little to clever for its own good.  It tries to throw a few too many curve balls at viewers to throw them off the track but in doing so, allows one to basically eliminate every character from suspicion out of general principle.  And of course there's little doubt that the film was made with the idea of a sequel already planned.<br /><br />An effective thriller, more for the mood and settings than for the actual plot, but a well done effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>First of all, If I could give this movie negative stars I would. Secondly, If I had the choice of seeing this movie again, or bashing my head in with a big blunt object, I would grab the biggest rock I could find and smash away. This movie is a disgrace, and I'll tell you why I think this in a second. Before I go any further though, let me just say that this movie does have some very morbid and graphic torture scenes, and it does have a few good scenes to make you jump, but that's about it at the very least. Now, I hate this movie for so many reasons that I can't even keep count, but mostly because it wasn't what I expected it to be, or what they hyped it up to be on the previews. If you're looking for a horror or scary movie to watch this definitely isn't the movie for you, but if you need a good laugh it's perfect. Afterall, I laughed my head off because some of that stuff was so cheesy. I don't really think the budget was really the major problem because there have been some brilliant movies that had small budgets, but I do think this movie was just written terrible. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the concept of this movie, but what I can't appreciate is the shabby way they put this movie together, and then smacked us in the face with that horrible ending. I'm sorry to spoil the ending for you if you haven't been fortunate enough to see this movie, but I gotta say that having an old man that was already dying turn out to be the insane killer at the end was pure GENIUS! I wonder who's bright idea that was. I felt so cheated by the time the movie ended I just sat there looking at the credits going they can't be serious. For crying out loud, they could've just kept the hospital orderly the killer if that's the best that they could do, and even that was too far-fetched. I could bash this movie all night long, but the last thing I have to say is that I had a choice in seeing this movie, or watching "The Grudge", and I wish I would have picked the other movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>that is the central question in this creepy and excessively violent thriller that works well as long as you don't stop and think about it to long!<br /><br />  to men awake in a dirty bathroom chained to the walls,a dead body between them,with tapes telling them that one must kill the other to save his family. the man(a doctor) is given a bullet and the dead man has a gun in hand(he looks to have shot himself)! problem is neather man can reach him,but they have hacksaws,they won't cut the chain,but they will cut......well you get the idea! the rest of the movie unfolds as the men try to find out why they are there,and what's going on.<br /><br />  this grim story is one that will pull you in and has a great twist at the end,just don't think about it to much! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>Saw is an amazing horror flick and Jigsaw (Bell) is definitley a new horror hero. 2 men (Elwes, Whannell) are shackeled broken down bathroom. Dr. Gordon has to kill his cellmate Adam or his wife (Potter) and daughter (Vega) will die.<br /><br />Tracking down Jigsaw is a dectective name David Tapp (Glover) and his partner Steven Sing (Lueng).<br /><br />This film also stars Dina Meyer as Detective Kerry. Shawnee Smith as Amanda. And Michael Emerson as Zep Hindle. This film really has a cool idea about a killer who doesn't actually kill his victims. He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. For them to survive, they have to go through his deadly games.<br /><br />Performances are very good, some over the top, but very good. The ending really makes this film one of the best films of 2004.<br /><br />This uncut edition really has no extra scenes, just an extended scene of Amanda finding the key inside a man's body.<br /><br />Saw is a must-see horror film. And it's sequel is even more awesome.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Watching Saw, there's a feeling that this film could've been great but it never quite gets there and I can't seem to figure it out. Sure the acting is a little rough but it's a horror movie, not an Oscar contender. The film loses steam halfway through only to pick up at the end so it's not a thrill ride from beginning to end. It's got incredibly fast editing with a jerky image at times so it's obviously trying to make things more exciting than it needs too. But in the end it's a pretty satisfying film if you let it.<br /><br />The film opens with an odd idea: 2 men are chained up on opposite ends of a really dank and decrepit bathroom. In the middle is a guy with a gunshot wound in his head, a gun in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. After some searching they find out why they're there: a killer nicknamed Jigsaw put them there and wants one of them to kill the other or his wife and daughter will die. There's clues all around them to get out, including tools for one method that's quite grisly.<br /><br />You can tell there's a certain enthusiasm with this: the film doesn't have a sense of an obvious independent film as it's smartly written and has quite an ending(although it probably won't make sense). There is some gore in the film but it's not outright gory except for a few shots. In fact, except for those certain shots it's kind of tame at times. The unrated adds some extra footage but I honestly couldn't figure out where the new stuff was.<br /><br />Acting wise well..., don't forget that this is an independent film shot incredibly quickly so there's bound to be some performances that are kinda eek. The writing's pretty sharp although at times it's quite illogical. Pretty soon a character's like "wait a minute, I know this!" to actually explaining certain obvious parts. But all the clues and hidden things are clever but like I said, some are kind of like "well he figured that out pretty quickly".<br /><br />Like the other big Sundance film Blair Witch Project, it's a film that seemed refreshing and well-liked despite its flaws. I wouldn't blind buy this in case you don't like it but if you rent it and like, well why not keep it?</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>Fans of horror, rejoice! After the crapsome crap that's been spilling out of Hollywood like so much blood from an elevator for the last number of years, here is finally a movie with a lot of originality and some actual, honest-to-god shock moments!<br /><br />Although horror really isn't a fair genre in which to bracket 'Saw', seeing as how it's not really a scary movie, in the traditional sense of the term. No ghosts, no supernatural goings-on, no girls with long black hair crawling backwards out of the television, and nothing in the loft. Think of it more as a terribly effective thriller, set in a very grim environment.<br /><br />To synopsise the plot, two men wake up chained to opposite walls of a disused men's room. There's a corpse laying dead in the centre of the floor, with a cassette player in his hand. Our two protagonists find cassettes in their pockets, personally addressed to them. And from there, they must piece together the events that have led up to their capture, as well as find a way out of their predicament before six o' clock... or else!<br /><br />Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) aren't great actors, so there's not a lot on offer for fans of carefully crafted performances. Some of the plot devices, too, feel a little familiar, once the movie gets going. And there's a lot of visual fluffing, in terms of flashy camerawork and overwrought flashback sequences. So what makes "Saw" work so well?<br /><br />Originality. The first thirty minutes of the movie are as affecting in their visual melancholia as they are in the amount of tension they succeed in building. Director James Wan's success in establishing the initial hopelessness and melancholia of the captives' situation is admirable, given that it's so simple. The story, too, is a more original version of a serial killer fable, and while the flashiness of the movie won't really cause you to mull over the nature of good and evil, there's certainly a strong backstory behind the events of the main film.<br /><br />Set-pieces are similarly original - think of a slightly less plausible version of 'Se7en' and you'll get an idea of what I mean. It's not a very gory movie, either, despite what you may have heard - but the imagery that Wan uses is very unsettling in places, and very effective because of this. And performance-wise, while the two leads won't win any oscars for this one, they're by no means bad actors, nor are they unsuccessful in setting out what the intend to do - personally, I was rooted to my seat from beginning to end, and, in a time where bad horror has made it nigh-on impossible for us to feel fear in the cinema anymore, that's no mean feat.<br /><br />All in all, "Saw" is highly deserving of praise for being a truly original and very effective movie. It's well-made, it's tense, and it's very compelling. While rental might be enough for most of us, the DVD extras are enough to warrant purchase, and all in all, I can recommend this one very highly.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>I love movies that no nobody survive in them! except bad people!

It got me revived, the only better movie I've ever seen is "The Texas Chinsaw Massacre (2004)"</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>About six or so months ago "Saw" was the four hundred pound gorilla rampaging through several of the horror websites I frequent. Every other day brought new photos, new links to trailers, new behind the scenes stories, and new conjectures all pointing to the incredible potential of this movie. Those insiders lucky enough to view the film before its general release spoke in reverent tones about the carnage we all would soon see with "Saw." They furthermore whispered words like "giallo" and "Argento" to describe the stylistic aspects of the movie. Needless to say I wanted to see this picture in the worst way after reading such high praise: I love films larded with gory carnage, love gialli, and think Dario Argento is one of the great horror masters of the modern age. Sadly, seeing "Saw" in the theater would not become a reality for me. In a tradeoff with my girlfriend that I will rue until the day I die, I agreed to attend a screening of the pedestrian "The Forgotten" instead of "Saw." I just got my revenge, however, by forcing her to watch the DVD edition of a film that I consider one of the best new horror films to come down the pike in quite some time.<br /><br />"Saw" begins by introducing us to two characters who will come to dominate most of the film's screen time: Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). The two men awake to find themselves chained to pipes in a phenomenally grungy bathroom with little knowledge of how they got there or why they are there. Then they start discovering clues: a corpse clutching a tape recorder and pistol lies in a pool of blood in the center of the room, envelopes containing cassette tapes lie in their pockets, hacksaws soon turn up, and a camera watches them from behind a two way mirror. It's obvious someone with a sick sense of humor placed these guys in this room with a purpose in mind, and that purpose gradually comes to the fore with horrific implications. Dr. Gordon suddenly recalls a series of incidents a few months before involving a serial killer named Jigsaw, a killer whose victims perish in extraordinarily graphic ways. It turns out that this murderer isn't an average stalk and slash psychopath, however, but a cunning sadist who thinks his mission is to teach others the value of life. He does so by placing them in traps that require the subject to overcome their flaws in order to escape. Adam and Gordon are definitely caught up in Jigsaw's latest shenanigans.<br /><br />Most of what we learn in "Saw" comes from flashbacks from Adam and Gordon. We learn that a Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) and his fellow investigators on the force tried to pin the crimes on Dr. Gordon when they linked a piece of evidence to the good doctor. We also discover that Gordon has a lot of family problems with his daughter and wife. Heck, it isn't too long before we realize that nearly every major character--Tapp, Adam, Gordon, and a couple of others--possesses some secret that hints at the possibility that any of these guys could be Jigsaw. And we learn more about Jigsaw, his strange philosophy, his haunts, and his stomach churning props. This killer locked one of his victims, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), in a helmet that could tear her head apart and demanded she look for the key in the most unusual of places. He's a warped, warped individual, but he's also a guy who keeps his word. If his victim escapes from his scheme they are free to reenter society, hopefully with a better outlook on the importance of life. "He helped me," claims Amanda, and it's disturbing to realize you understand exactly what she means.<br /><br />Jigsaw's philosophy is one of only a large number of massively disturbing elements in "Saw," but it's one of the more interesting ones. People say his stance on life mirrors the film "Seven," and perhaps that is so. I saw a greater similarity between Jigsaw's tortures and the scene in "Fight Club" where Tyler Durden uses the threat of death to force a young convenience store clerk to follow his dream of becoming a veterinarian instead of wallowing in apathy. The idea is to get people to wake up and start appreciating each and every day. If it takes a barbed wire trap or a bear trap helmet to bring the sheep to their senses, so be it. "Saw" offers us more than mere mental gymnastics, fortunately, including Cary Elwes hamming it up as the coolly aloof Gordon, a very creepy puppet used to great effect, and a scene with a flashbulb taken right out of the original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre." In fact, "Saw" rips off a lot of stuff from other classic horror films, but it does so in way that didn't bother me. Frankly, I like to see a movie paying homage once in awhile. What did surprise me was the gore, or lack thereof. This is the unrated cut? Where's the sauce? There are a few nasty surprises but "Saw" keeps most of the grue safely out of camera range. Pity.<br /><br />Extras on the widescreen edition disc disappoint. I kicked back before starting the behind the scenes feature, figuring that the whole thing would take twenty or thirty minutes to play out. It took TWO AND A HALF MINUTES! Then there's a music video and a short documentary about making the music video. The poster gallery and trailers section don't break new ground, nor does the commentary track from director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell. Who wants to bet a double dip special edition DVD will arrive in stores soon? Any takers? Nevertheless, "Saw" is definitely worth a watch; it's a fine film that blows away most of the mainstream horror coming out today.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>If you read my reviews you know I tend to stay away from horror movies, even at my old age they give me the creeps.  However, my family tells me if they are going to watch the comedies with me, I must watch some horrow with them.  So....I sat and watched "Saw."<br /><br />I have to say it was quite a different beginning and really got my attention with the two men in the bathroom, just what was going on? We find out our killer is somewhat different than the 'norm,' whatever that maybe. He has a purpose,an intent in what he is doing and who he is doing it to. Now, to just figure out what that is and why. All of our victims have a chance of saving their lives, but will they pay the price to do it?<br /><br />I think the ending was the best, what a shocker that was.<br /><br />All in all, not too gory and really had a different storyline.<br /><br />Now on to the comedies!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>I had a female friend who thought about seeing this movie at a theater near the beach.  The question was should she see Saw by the seashore?<br /><br />Actually, beyond some puns, I'm not positive of the merit of this movie.  It is clever, probably too clever for its own good.  The story focuses on a serial killer who puts his victims in elaborate traps which over a minimal chance of escape.  Two men wake up to find themselves chained in a dingy bathroom in an abandoned building.  The only means of freedom are some rusty hacksaws which are just sharp enough to cut off a bound foot.<br /><br />Through flashback, we are introduced to an obsessed detective who is pursuing this killer.  While bright enough to pick up tiny clues, he is also inept enough to wander into this genius killer's lair without a real plan or backup (beyond a single partner).  This allows the killer to get away and engineer his next trap.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are not very many of these "dumb" moments, and in reality, the biggest problem with the movie is its convoluted nature.  For most of the movie, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, and knew it would come down to the inevitable final twist, which was neither good nor bad enough to generate any real reaction.<br /><br />One mark of a good movie is when you forget you're watching a movie:  with all the stylized direction and overly clever plotting, it's hard to get that absorbed in this film.  This is an interesting movie and not really a bad one, but it's also imperfect.  It also owes a lot to other movies, especially Seven, and you might be better off seeing those movies.  See Saw?  Some say si; I say you might enjoy it if you're a fan of these types of thrillers, but you might not.  I guess you could say I can't make up my own mind; I keep seesawing on Saw.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>"Saw" is the suspense horror film to buy on DVD for this first quarter of 2005. After hearing mixed opinions about the movie, I felt that there was only one thing to do, ..see the movie for myself. I wasn't among those that were disappointed. Although the acting was a bit rusted (not by all), it was easily tolerable. The film had plenty of suspense, chills, and thrills around every unexpected twist and turn. Sure, there are those who knew what was going to happen next, but did they really? I found the idea of the movie fresh. I welcomed each intense moment. I'm not much on breaking things down in a movie review. I just recommend them or not. In this case I recommend "Saw" to those who like well paced horror.

It is both clever and interesting. There is a lot to take in, but that is a good thing. It focusses on two men who wake up in an old change room/toilet chained to the plumbing.

Once again, very clever.<br /><br />SAW is the work of two Australian scripwriters, one of whom plays a lead role in the film. It was originally intended as a straight-to-video film but impressed the right people and gained a cinema run world-wide.  Rumoured to have been severely cut in places to enable a moderate rating, fans of the film will no doubt hope the DVD release features the full uncut version.

Neither man knows why he has been abducted, but instructions left on a microcassette order Dr. Gordon to kill Adam within eight hours. If he fails to do so, then both men will die; Dr. Gordon's wife, Alison and his daughter will also be killed. Recalling a recent murder investigation by a police detective named Tapp Dr. Gordon realizes he and Adam are the next victims of a psychopathic genius known only as "Jigsaw." With only a few hours left to spare, they must unravel the elaborate puzzle of their fate in the midst of mounting terror. The killer has provided them with only a few clues and two handsaws - too weak to break their steel shackles, but strong enough to cut through flesh and bone...Director James Wan expertly spins this intricate tale, creating a chilling landscape of dread where nothing is quite as it seems. An edge-of-your-seat ride bristling with emotional intensity, SAW will keep you guessing until the very end. However an experienced horror veteran like myself found it a bit unoriginal, but it had the right idea, just not execiution.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>I rented this and what can I say?

Not only that, but there's a minature saw blade that moves too. It defintely pushed me over the edge. Hopefully the movie is as good (especially "uncut") and creative as the package it came in.

On one hand, this movie is incredibly raw and visceral.  It gets under your skin with its disturbing images and ideas.  On the other hand, we have the most horrible acting jobs by some very talented AAA actors.<br /><br />Danny Glover plays a cop who is tracking the Jigsaw killer.  Cary Elwes is playing one of the possible victims of said killer who finds himself locked in a dingy restroom with two people, one in the center of the room who apparently blew his brains out and another unfortunate soul locked on the other end of the restroom.<br /><br />It seems that the Jigsaw killer has been kidnapping people and finds ingenuously creepy ways for them to kill themselves.  He never really does the act of it, but makes it so that it's virtually impossible for one to survive.<br /><br />That is the premise for the movie, and I won't spoil anything else.  Part of the reason I liked this movie was because of the pacing.  I found the movie to be expertly paced, with mounting tension and a lot of dread.  You wonder how or even if the two victims will ever make it out alive.  The other reason I enjoyed the movie was the way it set up the past of former victims and current victims, even pulling in Danny Glover's character in interesting ways.  There is a thread that holds everyone together and I found it incredibly fascinating.<br /><br />One thing reviewers have aptly mentioned is the gore.  This movie was a few shots over the R rating and had to be scaled down.  It is not for the squeamish.  If you've seen Se7en, you'll understand a portion of what the movie has to offer.  It's actually very surreal like Se7en and I think that movie is the closest I can compare to Saw.<br /><br />So, we have great pacing, good actors, an interesting (if ultimately unplausable in some spoiler aspects which I won't mention) story, good gore and some nice suspence.  What holds it back?  The acting.  The acting is amateurish in spots and really detracts from at least two major scenes.  Where it really hurts the movie is at the climax.  This is supposed to be a fearsome, horrible, scary moment and instead I laughed because of Cary Elwes.  I hate to say it, but it really ruined what suspense had been building.<br /><br />My other complaint with the climatic moment involving the title stems from a very sudden change in the character.  You know it's going to happen because it's been talked about constantly.  Yet, the motivation for the character to do it seemed a bit forced.  I think it would have been much much more effective if we saw the GRADUAL drive towards the act, not an instant jump.  I think his character could have been more effectively developed.  But that is just a preference as a plot buff.<br /><br />My 4 star review, then, comes from the fact that the movie was done a very small budget.  They shot the entire movie in 18 days because they could not afford any longer.  That means that each scene was not really a "final cut."  Instead they had to go with first or second takes simply because of funding.  The acting becomes understandable under that constraint.<br /><br />In the end, this movie doesn't have many jump out, cheap scares.  It has a more subtle terror that gets under your skin and makes you look under your car and in your closet before you go to sleep.  It's terrifying in a non-normal Hollywood way.  It's in your face and visceral.  In all honesty, if you like crime thrillers like Se7en, if you like horror movies, and if you aren't squeamish, then this is definitely a horror movie to see.  There are enough twists and turns and suspense to overshadow the poor acting.  Recommend a rent and possibly a buy.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>As someone who is admittedly addicted to horror films, I'd like to think I've seen it all. But every now and then, a movie comes along, takes me by surprise, and knees me in the groin. "Saw" is that film. From beginning to end, this movie is pure intensity. Directed by the young James Wan, who is just getting started in the business (and got one helluva headstart with this movie), "Saw" revolves around two seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) who wake up opposite of each other in a dirty, stinky, sketchy old bathroom, chained to the pipes and with a dead body loafing in between them. It seems that someone is playing a game with them, someone who selects the players in his game for a reason. He doesn't actually kill these people himself, but somehow, they end up dead (sound familiar, Kevin Spacey fans?). Hot on his trail, in a simultaneous subplot is Detective David Tapp (played by Danny Glover), who has a has a vendetta against one of the men trapped in the room. The movie moves at a brisk pace. It is absolutely unrelentless and virtually humorless. There isn't a moment where the movie sags, or where you, the viewer, can relax. Everytime you think you've wrapped your head around this movie, a curveball is thrown at you, straight up until the knock-out ending. I really can't explain much more about the plot without ruining parts of the movie. No doubt, this movie bares similarities with "Se7en," both in the story (which was also penned by Whannell) and in Wan's directing style. However, instead of coming off as derivitive, Wan uses his obvious influences to paint a totally different picture. He uses some stark, nightmarish images to full effect (check out the child abduction scene...how creepy) and turns old cliches (Adam's apartment scene) on their heels. The story, and more importantly, the characters are what's important here. Whannell created two very different, flawed, but sympathetic leads that we really start to care for, despite whatever events unfold (I saw a little of myself in Adam). Overall, I can't find a flaw in this film. It is just mind-blowing. It is perfectly crafted. Every little shot in this movie is in there for a reason, so pay attention. "Saw" is more than just your average thriller, and it doesn't reduce to splatterfest either (although there are some grisly scenes). Easily the best horror flick to come out last year. Fans of the genre should not miss it. The DVD is a little disappointing, with the mere highlight being the insightful commentary from Wan and Whannell. Also included is a feature, albeit brief, on the making of the movie, along with two versions of Fear Factory's "Bite The Hand That Bleeds" video and a making of the video segment. Pretty skimpy for a landmark release like this. I smell a re-release on the horizon (?).</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>I liked this movie a lot, I don't get all the negative reviews. However, I have a different complaint than most people though: I would really have liked to see more people fall victims of this killers elaborate traps (I would have liked to seen more traps) More gore please. Even though it did give some good gore, it just teased me.<br /><br />I think people didn't like this movie because of the ending, which I liked a lot. Or people are just crying because they couldn't figure out the ending. You cannot win, people either cry when a movie is predictable, or they cry when it doesn't follow the norm. Make up your mind morons. Anyway, it filled part of my gore meter, so I was happy with it. Loved the ending</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>It's become very clear that hollywood has ran into a monster<br /><br />creative wall. This movie is just trying to take advange of<br /><br />another little "horror" era that probably started with The<br /><br />Ring a few years ago. This is a rather predictable movie as<br /><br />even my moronic brother in law seen who the "killer" was just<br /><br />shortly after he appeared in the film.<br /><br />The main focus on the movie is two guys with one being a<br /><br />doctor and the other guy gets paid to snoop and take<br /><br />pictures of other peoples business. The movie for the most<br /><br />part goes for shock value. Not that I mind, but it's just<br /><br />that the movie isn't as deep/dark and scary as it wants to<br /><br />be. There are a few original ideas like "the head vice" but<br /><br />for the most part the movie just takes bits and pieces from<br /><br />other movies of the genre and puts them together.<br /><br />I'd have to say the acting is the worst. Cary Elwes is just<br /><br />an aweful actor in this film. How could the director  allow<br /><br />such pathetic work? Did Cary just come THAT cheap? Even<br /><br />Danny Glover was bad in this one! It is sad because even<br /><br />though it steals from other movies it could have been alot<br /><br />better. The acting and bits in pieces seem abit to rushed.<br /><br />And we can't forget the car scene. What's up with that?<br /><br />As somebody said, why not just have a few cut scenes? It's<br /><br />much easier and less annoying.<br /><br />However, even with the bad acting and unoriginal ideas<br /><br />even a poor mans Se7en is better than alot of movies in<br /><br />this genre nowdays. You would probably be better off to<br /><br />wait until this comes in HBO though. It simply isn't<br /><br />worth the money. It will will help out a spoof movie in<br /><br />the future though.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>This is another instance where hype leads to disappointment. Saw was a big "word-of-mouth" film when it came out in theaters. It was supposedly "different". Not typical horror, more of a mix of twisted psychological horror, suspense, and whodunit. It wasn't a gore fest by any means (although it's pretty darn gruesome at times). And some people loathe it for that because they expected copious amounts of blood and gore, and Saw didn't really deliver that.<br /><br />Its story and devices smack of "The Abominable Doctor Phibes", or the serial killer movie "Se7en" ... even a scenario from "Suspiria" is borrowed. "Saw" plays with several genres including the detective story. It comes off at first viewing as engaging but truly it's not a fun movie by any means. Some horror movies are fun because they are truly scary and entertaining. Saw is not entertaining enough or truly scary; it's fairly suspenseful and feels tantalizing in its puzzles, but it needs more than that to succeed. But to be fair, when you consider that this was a low budget indy movie, its tremendous success is really impressive.<br /><br />I'm not going to describe the premise or plot too much. Too many reviews for Saw start by saying "These two guys wake up chained to a pipe in a disgusting bathroom..." and they begin to delve into a nutshell synopsis. You'll find out what it's about when you watch it.<br /><br />Saw doesn't really quite know what it is, or what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie? Some say yes, others deny it vehemently. Yes, it's stylish enough (but sometimes the silly sped-up cinematography gets too obvious, like the film is trying hard to be cool), and the twisted scenarios that the psycho has dreamed up are pretty disturbing. But there seems to be not really enough meat here. When it's finished we are left feeling a bit empty... like what we just experienced was just an exercise in sadism, and not much more. And the entire story falls apart when carefully scrutinized. It's a bit disappointing when you see so much potential at the start, and then witness the movie fizzling/struggling until its surprise ending.<br /><br />Bottom line: worth a look for horror buffs, but overall nothing to scream about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>I dont know whether the makers of the Saw were really influenced by the 2 films i mention in the title of this review. But the parallels are very obvious to anyone who's seen them.<br /><br />As 2 people wake up chained to the walls of a toilet of an abandoned factory with a corpse lying in the middle of the room, the expectable questions arise in their minds: "How did we get here". "What's going on?". "Who is that corpse". Soon they find out that they've become a central piece in the game of a psycho who's teaching them a lesson which they don't understand. We as viewers are given more clues to figure it all out than they have, but as the thread unreels we have a disturbingly lingering sense that what we are let to know is pure deception. Their choices? To either kill each other or free themselves by sawing off one of their chained legs.<br /><br />  Sounds like this could get pretty gory, correct? Not really, as the main premise of the "Saw" is a purely mental one, in the sense that it's more aiming to be a sarcastic mindgame on the viewer rather than a cheap thrill gorefest. The violence is mostly implied and the violent scenes are actually few (keeping in mind what this could've become).<br /><br />  The film succeeds with flying colours in its mission then, as noone will easily resist trying to find out who the evil game-maker is. But as the clues pile up and the atmosphere goes from dark to darker so do the twists. Speaking of twists, there are so many here that the script writer walks a very thin line actually. The storyline is in danger of tipping over any single minute but this is a job ultimately well done. Aside of one single plot mistake (albeit sizey)  that i spotted right at the very end, the rest of the film is actually rock-solid. And even this one mistake will be inevitably excused because "Saw" offers a tremendous ride throughout to those that like their minds tested.<br /><br />  This is then the best asset of the film. It's not just a mere "whodunnit" flick but also a very stylistic dark film that will surely enter the pantheon of great thrillers in recent time.<br /><br />  The atmosphere keeps being in heavy competition with the excellent plot and in the end noone really cares who wins that contest. You want to see the story unraveling and you become increasingly addicted to the darkness oozing out of the screen.<br /><br />  On top of that, with the exception of Danny Glover, the main characters are wisely chosen to be 2 not known actors who do a more than just decent job delivering their parts. The dialogue is up to par with the rest of the film and overall "Saw" wins the bet with itself in highly convincing fashion.<br /><br />  No need to get into the details of the plot here. If you were fascinated by the Usual Suspects and the Cube be sure to see this film. It will be right up your alley.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot?  This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer.  I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so.  I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.<br /><br />I didn't understand, or care, why any of the characters were acting the way they did; or what was going to happen to them. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>SAW is a good thriller: a film with a lot of potential, but lacking in follow-through.  On the one hand, the premise is very cool.  Two men wake up in a bathroom, chained to piping, completely unaware of where they are or why.  As the film progresses, these two men start to piece together their situation: they have been planted in this situation by a deranged madman, someone who enjoys placing his victims in life-or-death situations and forcing them to make horrific decisions.  It's a marvelous setup and the surprising conclusion is right on target and thrilling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film reeks of a small budget.  The acting, in particular, is quite poor.  Unlike SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SAW fails to explore its characters.  Instead, the madman's device becomes the center of the entire film and our poor actors get to scream and cry their way through 100 minutes.  Moreover, our madman is portrayed as a deranged person, complete with a secret lair and everything.  Unfortunately, we don't come any closer to understanding him by the end of the film than we did at the start.  He appears to be "teaching" his victims a moral lesson, but what that lesson is in his mind is completely obtuse.  Both SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS also have clever plot devices, deranged madmen, and the like.  But unlike SAW, they decide to spend most of their time revealing their characters instead of merely relying on the plot devices.  The result is a much more engaging, interesting, and ultimately satisfying thriller.  It may seem like a strange thing to say, but exploring the haunted games of a madman is not nearly as creepy as exploring the haunted depths of a madman's mind.<br /><br />In the end, SAW has a really cool plot device on its hand, but lacks the heart and complexity of other thrillers.  It's definitely worth a look and will thrill anyone who loves this genre.  But with mediocre acting and complexity, it will never reach the status of either SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The nature of human motivation has usually two different sources that elicit a certain behavior.  These sources are either extrinsic or intrinsic.  Intrinsic motivation stems from within a person while the extrinsic source is influence generated by someone or something else.  Whether the source is external or internal it also presents a further division in needs and desires.  Needs being what a person requires to survive, and desires illustrates what a person wants.  Saw presents situations where human motivation is put to the test in regards to survival and the desire to live.  However, the situation that Saw presents comes at a dreadful price, which will undoubtedly terrorize the audience's own consciousness and perception of human needs and desires.<br /><br />The opening of Saw introduces two characters chained to heavy pipes in an abandoned bathroom at some unknown location where no one can hear them scream.  The room has intense lighting once the lights are turned on, which tosses no shadows of either character. In essence, it is a visual analogy for how their persona will be scrutinized by both parties, as the light will reveal everything.  Quickly one of the men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), questions why they are there because if someone desired them dead it could have been accomplished long ago.<br /><br />When the light is turned on for the first time, Adam (Leigh Whannell), discovered that he is not alone in the room, as between him and Dr. Gordon there is a corpse with a gun in it's hand and a tape recorder in the other.  It seems as if the corpse has blown away part of his own cranium with the gun in his hand.  Under the intense light the two chained men begin to search for ways of escaping, while they begin to discover small clues of what is expected out of them.<br /><br />It seems as if Adam is expected to kill himself, which he finds out through a tape that he finds in his own pocket.  Dr. Gordon discovers a similar tape and a bullet in his pocket that expresses anticipation in regards to Dr. Gordon who is expected to murder his new roommate.  The two men have a little more than six hours to find a solution to their deadly predicament.  During these six hours the audience is drawn into a number of flashbacks that provide information of how they were chosen to participate in this sick game.  It is also revealed that Dr. Gordon is aware of who the person is that has chained them in the unfamiliar room.<br /><br />Through Dr. Gordon it is disclosed that a serial killer that goes by the nickname Jigsaw has taken them hostage and chained them.  The killer himself has never actually killed someone, however, he has planned some truly grotesque schemes that have led to a tormenting death that has delivered pain of inconceivable magnitude.  The great extent to which the Jigsaw killer has planned his bizarre schemes will display a man with enormous amount motivation to seek some form of enlightenment in an outmost horrific manner.<br /><br />Saw dwells in the twilight land as it offers the audience a haunting journey that plunges deep into the darkness of the human psyche where nothing is sacred, as human motivation to live is skewed by an external source.  A mind to generate such horrors illustrates deep insights into psychology and human behavior, but it also displays the eccentricity of a creative mind.  James Wan and Leigh Whannell who created the story together offer a horror tale that evokes nightmares and difficult sleeping patterns in retrospect of the cinematic experience.<br /><br />The film had a good beginning theme, however, after about an hour and ten minutes the film seemed to begin slowly spiral downwards.  Nonetheless, Saw offers a truly ghastly film experience, which is built on good script and good mise-en-scene that helps enhance the terror in the story.  The camera work elevates the film, as it brings moments to the audience that will awaken feelings of revulsion and dismay.  In the end, do not expect a good night sleep, as Saw will haunt the mind for sometime after the end credits have been burnt into the retina of the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Saw" is an brilliant suspense thriller! It is one of the best suspense thrillers since "Seven" and "The Silence Of The Lambs"! I mean that with personal consideration for the film. It is inventive, well-executed, and, also, well-budgeted, as its production budget cost $1 million to make the movie and it is one of the best-looking movies this year. The story revolves about two men trapped in an old bathroom. Dr. Lawrence Gordon, played by Cary Elwes, is an oncologist. Adam, played by Leigh Whannell, is an photographer. Lawrence figures out that a serial killer named Jigsaw, that was involved with an murder investigation run by Detective David Tapp, played by Danny Glover and his partner, Detective Steven Sing, played by Ken Leung. Jigsaw has, somewhat, kidnapped them, and Lawrence and Adam find out that they are apart of a murderous game that Jigsaw gives to the victims that he kidnaps. Lawrence, also finds out that his wife, Allison, played by Monica Potter, and his daughter, Diana, played by Makenzie Vega, has been kidnapped by the same killer, as well. Lawrence and Adam, find out that Lawrence has to kill Adam by 6:00 p.m., or else, Diana and Allison will die, as well as, Lawrence and Adam. This is one of the best independent films in recent history and of all time. It is better than "The Blair Witch Project". Cary Elwes (who was recently seen on screen this year as Edgar in "Ella Enchanted" (2004) & on tv in "The Riverman" as serial killer Ted Bundy), does an well-executed performance as Lawrence, an man wrought with hard hitting emotion. Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the screenplay and co-wrote the story with its director, James Wan), does an pitch-perfect performance as Adam. Danny Glover (well known as Roger Murtagh in the Lethal Weapon movies) is superb as Tapp. The directing by James Wan is excellent. The story by Wan and Whannell is brilliant and the screenplay by Whannell is brilliant, as well. This is the way that screenplays for suspense thrillers should be written. It is inventive and well thoughtout. The music by Charlie Clouser (a producer for the rock group Nine Inch Nails) is excellent. The casting by Amy Lippens is excellent. The cinematography by David A. Armstrong is brilliant. The film editing by Kevin Greutert is excellent. The costume design by Jennifer L. Soulages is excellent. The production design by Julie Berghoff is brilliant. The art direction by Nanet Harty is brilliant. Go see it if you want to or not. It is a great movie to watch on Halloween. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film, which was shot in a scant eighteen days, is stunningly original in concept. I confess that I was totally riveted to the screen for the entire running time of the  film, as was my son. Edgy and somewhat surreal, the film clearly demonstrates that the director, James Wan,  can certainly do more with less, as the film was shot on a shoestring budget. Yet, he also knows that less is sometimes more, as he keeps the actual  amount of on screen gore to a minimum. In doing so, he forces a viewer's imagination to work overtime, which serves to create more suspense than a visual statement of the obvious.<br /><br />The plot is diabolically clever. It appears that a maniac is on the loose, placing people in fiendish situations that are truly matters of life or death, virtually ensuring that someone dies. The deaths occur in a highly unusual manner, indicative of a complex and maniacal mind at work. Detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung) are on the case and hot on this maniac's trail. When on the verge of his capture, however, everything goes wrong, and Detective Tapp becomes somewhat unhinged after a total debacle ensues.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr.  Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), who was himself a suspect in the case, suddenly finds himself in a filthy, ancient, cavernous bathroom, along with a young man  named Adam (Leigh Whannell). Both are chained to pipes in the wall and are disoriented and unsure as to how they got there. Between them and just beyond their reach lies an apparently dead man in a pool of blood, ostensibly killed with the gun that he still holds in his hand. Then, Dr. Gordon and Adam discover that a series of cryptic  instructions have been left for them to follow.  Each instruction clearly delineates just how precarious their position is.<br /><br />What follows is a mesmerizing cat and mouse game, replete with a number of twists and turns, that is sure to keep the viewer enthralled. This is certainly a plot driven, rather than character driven, film. Therefore, although some of the acting is not of the highest caliber, it matters not, as it is the plot, and not the individual characterizations, that are at the central core of this gripping film. Moreover, the plot is so creative and riveting, that some of its flaws become virtually insignificant in the overall scheme of things.  The screenwriter, Leigh Whannell, who also plays the part of Adam, deserves kudos for his complex and clever screenplay. He deserves less than that for his portrayal of Adam. Mr. Whannell should concentrate on screenplay writing, as it is there that his true gift lies. Notwithstanding this relatively minor criticism, I love this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think.

You struggle out of one nightmare to awake in another: you're not in your own bed. The darkness is total: the stink of death rancid in your nostrils. You're on a cold, wet tile floor, but beyond that you can't see anything, can't find your way in the ink-black dark that covers you. You panic: your breath is fast and ragged, you whimper and cry out.<br /><br />Now: most nightmares are the worst when the lights are out; when the lights come on, you're snug, cuddled beneath the blanket of Normalcy and the Everyday. In "Saw", the nightmare begins when the lights come on.<br /><br />By now, everyone knows the legendary set-up of the deliciously sick piece of celluloid that is "Saw": Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, playing a guy named "Lawrence" if ever there was one) awake chained to pipes across from each other in a filthy industrial utility room. In the middle of this abbatoir lies the corpse of a man, face down in his own blood, a .38 revolver clamped in his dead hand. Their true whereabouts? Unknown. How they came there? Unknown. The someone---or something---that delivered them to such a state?<br /><br />Unknown.<br /><br />"Saw" might pass itself off as a horror movie, but the fact is that this engine of death and destruction is a flick with more on its mind than splatter. This is a film about Crime and Punishment.<br /><br />In our enlightened age, we kill our killers with lethal injection. Think of that: those who kill children and bury them alive, hack the limbs off antique pensioners, those who scar and murder and rape and mutilate and defile---all of them are sent out of this vale of tears in a state of peaceful, drug-addled slumber. Some of you---myself included---would say this is a travesty: even the Death Penalty in our enfeebled land is hardly a true punishment tailored to the brutalities perpetrated by the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Well, then, rejoice in "Saw", for the killer---the man, or Creature, or being, or darksome thing that lurks behind the name and mask of the Jigsaw Killer---feels as we do: he is a believer in Justice. He is a believe in the ultimate Talmudic rite: let the Punishment fit the Crime.<br /><br />Dr. Gordon and Adam find their respective instructions, left on a tape muffled and distorted but wickedly clear: they have eight hours. Eight hours to kill the other man, to cut him down like a dog, to find the key, to escape the deathhouse, this charnel sewer. Eight hours: Fail, and for Adam, it is Death. For Dr. Gordon, it is death---and the death of Family as well (Mackenzie Vega and Monica Potter, both carrying their weight admirably).<br /><br />"Saw" is a brilliant little piece of terror, perfectly economical, remarkably efficient at terrorizing its audience. It is more so for being entirely unpredictable: I found "Saw" to be the cinematic equivalent of drinking Scotch on the porch, outside, on a summer night: lifting the tumbler to your lips, only to find your mouth millimeters away from a fat, bloated, dying Black Widow spider, contorted with her death throes, larger than a piece of ice, floating, seething, dying in your drink.<br /><br />I have never seen a film---outside "The Blair Witch Project"---so dependent on light and dark to evoke a mood. I have never seen a film so entirely capable and competent at conjuring up a mood of isolation, of wicked machination, of brutal death, solely by its use of light and dark. "Saw" immerses you in a charnel house sunk deep within the ground, well stocked with clues---indeed, whatever you think of this monster called the Jigsaw Killer, you must at least acknowledge his willingness to provide his victims with the means to their salvation.<br /><br />Watch "Saw" in the dark, all the lights off, preferably with a storm howling and pounding outside the window. For "Saw" is only slightly a serial killer movie: it tips its hat to "Se7en" and "Silence of the Lambs", but its dark, wicked, brutal art is born from far more truly from the monster movie. "Saw" is about a monster: a creature that crawls, writhes, plots, engineers, from the shadows.<br /><br />Director James Wan has pulled off what, by my lights, is the perfect horror movie: compactly edited, brutally effective, happy to spill blood in the service of its message, consumingly efficient and economic. If there is a scarier device in cinema than a puppet rolled out on a tricycle to gibber in the dark, I have yet to see it. Wan and Director of Photography David Armstrong use dark and light to evoke claustrophobia, fear's aphrodisiac, and spike the mixture with psychedelic images of horror and death.<br /><br />The acting throughout is solid and compelling. Much has been said about Elwes's overracting---but as you watch "Saw", you realize this is a film about surfaces, and the darkness, and lies, and deception that lies beneath. Yes, Dr. Gordon is over the top---and he has a reason to be. Elwes and Whannel carry their roles like champs, right down to the point where those rusty hacksaws become one-way tickets to the bright land of Normalcy. Danny Glover (Detective Tapp)pounds out the most engaging, riveting performance of his career, as a defrocked detective who can't let go.<br /><br />"Saw" is a brutal, seedy, seething charnel-house of death and truth. Yes, yes---"Live or Die, make your Choice"---but if Jim Morrison was right about no one here getting out alive, how much of a choice do we have?<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Saw" is a pretty turgid affair despite the quick-cut, snappy title sequence a la David Fincher. The great title sequence of "Saw" is about the extent of the creative, adventurous juices on view in this film. And the actual director of this film, James Wan (what an appropriate name!) didn't have anything to do with the title sequence: a company that specializes in title sequences always does this.<br /><br />The plot as concocted by Wan and Leigh Whannel (who also plays Adam) is a cat and mouse contraption with so many inconsistencies that we soon lose interest in trying to figure it out. I mean: two men are chained to drain pipes in an abandoned sewage plant for reasons only their captor can fathom. To top that off there is a dead man on the floor surrounding by a huge pool of blood.<br /><br />The acting is grade school by Whannell (he had to have gotten this part by way of his deal with the studio) and Cary Elwes (remember when he was actually good?). And the big denouement is silly.<br /><br />I saw "Saw" and now I have indigestion.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>You heard me! This movie sucks.

A movie that is majorly responsible for this masochistic horror sub-genre, that's really is only an excuse to see people graphically tortured & mutilated, without any redeeming qualities. I was WRONG!<br /><br />I had just got Netflix streaming & there was "Saw." I thought to myself, why not, lets see what all the hoopla is about. I mean a film that is pretty much responsible for a whole horror sub-genre, has to have something going for it, right? Right! I was very pleasantly surprised! Here we have a film with a white knuckled terrific plot, what would you do to save yourself? Great acting, an intelligent script, great pacing & direction, & it was more than just a torture porn flick, it had redeeming qualities & characters. It was not what I expected at all! It was actually closer to films like "Silence of the Lambs" & "Seven, & was the best film of that ilk since those great movies! I was almost dumbfounded, & thought, why did I wait so long!<br /><br />"Saw" is a movie that every horror & non-horror fan should see. It is a shining example of how to get much mileage out of a film, with no gas money. Though I'm not inspired to check out it's sequels, as most sequels get progressively worse, this is a film I'll watch many more times, & recommend!<br /><br />A cutting edge film!</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>At first I really enjoyed this movie but the last half was okay and the ending was so excrucitaingly awful I fealt like I wasted an hour and a half just for a stupid ending like that.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>THis is one of those movies that does not play it fair.

Then, some minutes after the movie ends you suddenly ask yourself: "What the heck...?" The next affirmative is: "This is the new champion of plot holes". Then comes the sad conclusion: "What an awful movie! How could I be fooled this way?!"

Before there was Hoffman, Strahm, Jill, and Erickson, it was just Jigsaw testing Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon in an old dirty and filthy bathroom with a dead body in the middle. They hear a tape by Jigsaw that tells Dr. Gordon to kill Adam by 6:00 a.m., or his wife and daughter will die. Zep has his family hostage and Detecive David Tapp still thinks that Dr. Gordon is linked to the Jigsaw murders.

There are some horror films that are really good, meaning they have a solid story, genuine thrills, and leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Examples of good horror films are "Final Destination", the `Scream' trilogy, and the classic "Halloween". But for every really solid effort in the horror genre there are about 10 terrible entries that give the genre a bad name, most of these inferior entries consist of sequels to average or above average horror movies that are made for nothing more than cashing in on the original film's success and hopefully making a little money before fading quickly from the public's memory. In 2004, amidst a crop of forgettable horror releases, one horror movie caught audiences completely by surprise with its in-your-face brand of terror that hadn't been seen in most horror films, with a surprisingly strong story that was full of twists and turns that would make any mystery fan happy, and a fairly solid cast of actors that didn't consist of fresh-faced teenagers that barely have any acting experience. The movie I'm referring to was the smash hit "Saw" from director James Wan ("Death Sentence"), and starring Danny Glover (`Lethal Weapon' series), Cary Elwes ("Robin Hood: Men in Tights"), and Monica Potter ("Along Came a Spider").<br /><br />"Saw" focuses on a deranged serial killer who feels that it is his mission in life to teach those who take life for granted a lesson by capturing them and forcing them to choose between fighting for their lives by surviving horrifying circumstances or giving up and dying. His latest victims are a successful doctor (Cary Elwes) and a young photographer (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay). These two unwitting participants in the killer's twisted game must try to work together to solve the mystery of why they are being held captive, while determining the means of their escape from certain death. Meanwhile, a former detective (Danny Glover) is trying to put the pieces together regarding the last case he was working when he left the force, which unbeknownst to him is directly linked to the two captives who may soon become the latest victims of this methodical killer, with a simple message of, "Live or die, make your choice."<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I was a little mixed in my opinion of. The first time I watched "Saw" I didn't really care for it all that much, I thought that it was a better than average entry into the horror genre, but was trying too hard to cross genres with being a horror film and also a thriller in the vein of "Se7en". But after watching "Saw" for a second time, I feel it was a much better horror movie than I initially believed it to be, and was also an adequate mystery thriller that set itself apart from most horror films by actually having a decent story and not relying on some supernatural killer, that for some unknown reason audiences are intrigued by, to propel the movie forward. In fact, you barely even see the killer in this movie, which is even more surprising for a horror film these days, having a modern horror film that actually leaves its killer shrouded in mystery is unheard of, and was very much appreciated here.<br /><br />Now, some of you may be wondering where I came up with the comparison of "Saw" and "Se7en", well here it is. Both movies feature villains who feel it is their sole purpose in life to teach others a lesson about what they've done wrong in their lives. Both villains are patient, smart, and incredibly deranged in their view of the world, and feel completely justified in the pain they inflict upon their victims. I also feel that director James Wan was aware of this comparison, and purposely paid homage to "Se7en" with the use of the exact same type of notebooks that were used by the killer in the movie "Se7en" spread all over Danny Glover's apartment in this movie. With all the various types of notebooks out there why choose that same exact one, unless you were meaning for people to recognize it, and therefore draw comparisons. Now, James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell may not have intended for there to be as much comparison between the two films as I have seen, but the similarities are there all the same. With all that being said, I don't feel that "Saw" as a film, suffers from its similarity to "Se7en" (granted its not as strong of a mystery thriller as the latter, but it's adequate), the two films are different enough in their execution (no pun intended) that the similarity is nothing more than an obvious influence for their story.<br /><br />The actors were of a much higher caliber than one normally expects from horror films these days. Generally the cast of horror films consists of some of the newest actors Hollywood has to offer, and generally will focus heavily on talk of sex and feature plenty of nudity from its attractive leading ladies, thus ensuring plenty of teenagers (especially guys) will give the movie a generous box office return and maybe even repeat business. But, "Saw" went a different route by casting veteran actors such as Danny Glover and Cary Elwes, along with the not as well known Monica Potter to bring their characters to life. Most of the cast were very effective in their roles, even screenwriter Leigh Whannell as the other man trapped with Cary Elwes, was surprisingly good as an actor. But the weakest link in the acting chain was Cary Elwes. For an actor who has been around as long as he has, it's kind of a surprise that he's never managed to elevate his craft from anything more than that of an average actor who has a tendency to overact in his dramatic parts, but excels when it comes to comedy which is probably why "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" and "The Princess Bride" are the two biggest movies of his career. The decision to give Cary top-billing for this movie seemed odd, since he's not that big of a name, and from a talent perspective, I figured they would have given that honor to Danny Glover, but I'm not the one making those decisions.<br /><br />One more thing regarding this movie that also further set it apart from most movies of this genre is the lack of blood and gore that was actually seen in the film. Most horror films opt for putting as much blood and gore on the screen as they possibly can, leaving nothing to the imagination, and frankly most audiences are numb to it at this point. But "Saw" went with the approach of implied gore; yes, there were moments of bloodshed on the screen but not much more than what is shown in an all-out action movie. Although the blood and gore were implied, the film still delivers on the horror, by forcing the audience to envision in their heads what could have taken place onscreen. However, in place of actual blood and gore, the director and writer included plenty of disturbing traps and images, along with creepy music and quick, frantic editing, that gave the audience the impression that the film was much more violent and gory than it actually was which may cause some viewers to dislike the film due to an implied sense of an overabundance of gratuitous graphic violence.<br /><br />"Saw" is without a doubt a very creepy horror film that delivers plenty of chills, but also gives audiences a solid story that will keep them guessing what will happen next. A word to parents, this is one horror film that's rating should definitely be heeded, as I don't feel that viewers under the age of 17 should see this movie without parental approval.<br /><br />"Saw" is available in both rated R and unrated editions both contain violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>When you see it you will know what I am  talking about, the goriest part was just absolutely pointless.<br /><br />So other than than it was a mildly entertaining movie.<br /><br />One of the main problems I had with this movie is not setting up danny glover's character, this was just stupid in my opinion.<br /><br />Also the guy running the game was also kind of stupid when you learn all that is going on.  i think the movie would be better if they left some things untold and better involvement for the smaller characters would have helped.<br /><br />Overall gore when they didn't need it, a lot of wholes, and the fact that I never got that tension feeling I was looking for from the 2 main character.<br /><br />Other than that, it was pretty entertaining, rent it don't buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>When I sat down to watch this I had no idea what it was about. And it does not take long to find out. We start off with two men chain to opposite sides of a very grimy and disgusting large bathroom. In between them is the body of a man that shot himself in the head. The corpse has a gun in one hand and a tape player in the other. Everything just out of the two men's reach. And then the game begins; they each find an envelope in their pocket with tapes in them. And all they have is a hacksaw each that would never cut through the chains they wear.<br /><br />Then we watch as the story unfolds. The two victims figure out that an ingenious serial killer known as the jigsaw killer placed them there. This plot was well thought out. And the killer has left them no choice. They have to get out our pay the consequences.<br /><br />I do not know what those other reviewers are talking about. This is the first movie in a long time that I did not figure out who the killer was until they let us know. And I was surprised. This movie is worth watching. See if you can figure out who the killer is.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Saw is not the kind of movie which will make you wanna shut your eyes,grab the arm of the person sitting with you,make you jump from your couch and the other things one expects from a movie that is believed to be of much horror and brutality. I saw it last night and I think it is well almost worth the hype owing to the things that you have to explain to yourself rather than let the movie do it for you.<br /><br />The most possible reason for my curiousity for this movie is the amount of ridicule and disappointment people feel for Saw2. This movie was never released in my city but I had to wait and get a dvd from somewhere. It is a 100 minute film and just when your brain starts wondering what is going to happen next it hits with you two or three shocker moments. I must add that the music in the film adds to the tension and strange feeling of admirable awe it arose in me.<br /><br />WHO IS THIS MOVIE FOR?<br /><br />I wouldnt say this movie is for everyone because I am pretty sure a lot of people would find a few flaws and try to explain them to one another. Most people have a "we want to hate a movie" syndrome so it is defintiely not for those looking to ridicule. What really matters is the unique storyline and the sickness behind a brain that wants to teach you a lesson by playing with your life.<br /><br />WHAT WAS WEAK ABOUT THE FILM?<br /><br />The scenes involving the doctor cheating on his wife and the very poor enactment of a fight by the wife just before the doctor is leaving. Also the scene where he is on the laptop trying to look strangely passionate about his work. The detectives were silly too. However, that is about it cause there's a whole lot of WHOA inducing scenes in this suggestive epic of sorts.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>The DVD disc of SAW has a round saw on the label.<br />  Kidnapped and instantly a victim, similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305238065">Cube</a> (1998), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDVY">Cube 2 - Hypercube</a>(2002), Adam (Leigh Whannell) had just gone to bed. When he awakens, he finds himself submerged into a water-filled bathtub.  He gets out and finds another man, Lawerence (Cary Elwes, Twister [1996]) also in this unclean bathroom.  Lawerence is chained to a pipe too.  A third man has been killed and is lying on the floor.  The men don't remember how they got there.  They discover each has an envelope in their pocket with their name on it.  Inside the envelope is a mini-tape labeled "play me", a bullet and a small key.<br />  They manage to get the tape recorder away from the dead man.  The message for Adam is, "Are you going to watch yourself die, Adam, or do something about it".  Lawrence's message is that he must kill Adam by 6:00am or his wife and child will die and he will be left to rot in this bathroom.<br />  This industrial bathroom contains many more clues for the men.  The small key does not unlock the chains their foot is trapped in, so they must find a way to survive this thing before 6:00am.

This low budget horror flick falls into that category - stories that are meant to horrify audiences.  And it succeeds, on many levels.  Written by Director James Wan and actor (in this film) Leigh Whannell, SAW drags us into the darkened sewer where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) are chained to opposite sides of a filthy room, the centerpiece of which is a corpse recently dead by gunshot suicide.  Yet on this corpse is a tape recorder and after some otherworldly instructions, each man finds a tape on his person that gives instructions on how to take up the next hour and a half of grisly fantasy.<br /><br />It seems there are loonies out there whose sick minds seek retribution for being ignored or abused by the characters trapped in the sewer lounge.  Included in this m&eacute;lange are Dr. Gordon's wife (Monica Potter) and his daughter, medical and patient personnel from Gordon's oncology practice, and two detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) exploring a serial killer bent on have victims kill themselves in bizarrely medieval methods.  It now seems the good doctor and Adam are the latest players in the sicko's trail and how all this works out is a cat and mouse chase and pulse-pounding (?thudding) run to the finish.  No, giving away the ending would weaken the effect of the story, so leave that alone.  Just be ready to accept the fact that much is left unresolved, making it VERY obvious that we re in for SAW 2 sometime this year.<br /><br />If you love SEVEN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL, and other grisly shows, you'll love this little movie.  Despite its numerous flaws it does succeed in keeping you puzzled enough to overlook the bad acting.  And that is all you can ask from this genre!  Grady Harp, February 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I've managed to miss this one over the last four years. Doesn't deserve four stars in my view. For a film that was obviously made on a reletively low budget it mostly works well though.<br /><br />The story reminded me of the sort of thing Clive Barker might have written in his Books of Blood (a series of short stories). OK there are a few inconsistencies in the plot but I thought it was pretty well acted and the twist at the end is well done. There are some genuinely creepy, not to mention grisly, moments scattered throughout the film.<br /><br />However do not be mislead by the hype and the advertising blurb. This isn't a touch on 'Seven', which is better written, acted and in a totally different class. I have watched 'Seven' many many times, but having just finished watching 'Saw' I really have no desire to see it again.</p></br></body></html>

Yes, `North by Northwest' is Alfred Hitchcock at his finest.  Engrossing, deceptive and visually stunning; this is the type of `no holds bar' entertainment that keeps you glued to your seat throughout and begging for more upon the roll of the credits.<br /><br />The ever so dapper Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a man mistaken to be a undercover agent by enemy spies.  When they fail to kill him he winds up getting himself in deep with the feds as his story about kidnapping and spies seems as preposterous as it is convoluted.  Roger has to then take maters into his own hands in order to save his own life.  This is when he meets the beautiful Eve Kendall, and as soon as sparks begin to fly his whole world gets flipped upside down.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, but the great thing about Hitchcock is being able to experience it the way he intended; knowing very little.  The more you know the less you can truly be surprised by everything that Hitchcock has in store for you; and believe me, he has a lot in store with this one.<br /><br />From the stunning sets to the brilliantly choreographed stunts, this is a complete package; a marvelously crafted action thriller that actually has substance.  It doesn't trim away the intelligence to deliver a half hearted spectacle but balances the two brilliantly, as do most of Hitchcock's films.  The film is clever as all get out, which makes watching Roger get himself in and then out of trouble so much fun.  The performances are also very good here.  Cary Grant is an actor I am not very familiar with, but general consensus of his work is that he is more charm than depth.  I found him a perfect balance of both here, able to fluctuate effortlessly between his emotions and his characters grasp of his situation.  James Mason is amazing as the sinister Phillip Vandamm and Eva Marie Saint is stellar as Roger's love interest Eve.  She has this sensuality that permeates her scenes and draws us into her mystery.<br /><br />LOVE IT!<br /><br />Anyways, I totally recommend this one.  Like I said, I fear for saying too much so I'm cutting this one short.  It is totally worth it though, for any film fan.  It is just a great film, no matter which way you look at it.  Even those who are not fans of Hitchcock (like my wife) can enjoy this film.  If you love movies, you'll love this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>This is by far one of Cary Grant's best films. We now own the collection of most Alfred Hitchcock movies and actually play a game while watching them, for invariably he appears during his films. We watch and see who can spot his cameo appearances... my favorite is when Mr. Hitchcock is part of a portrait... so we had a devil of a time finding him during the movie.<br /><br />North by Northwest was produced in 1959 and it has a recipe of romance, intrigue, thrilling action, and mystery that produces a brilliant performance by Cary Grant.<br /><br />Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, an advertising executive who is erroneously kidnapped by enemies of a certain George Kaplan, supposedly a United States undercover agent. Mr. Thornhill is drugged but escapes and a fascinating series of events start to shape the plot. During this film, we see the appearance of great actors from Mission Impossible, the Man from Uncle, and other shows, which keep us at the edge of our seat with their mystery, thrilling action, and romance.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint plays the part of the woman Cary Grant falls for. She is sexy, elegant, poised... and the two engage in some of the most interesting dialogue, which at some point, culminates in the most interesting of romantic kisses ever produced by Hollywood.<br /><br />The filming in New York City allows the audience to travel through Manhattan in the 50's and it is amazing how it all remains the same, and yet due to security... it is all so very different, especially with regards to visiting the United Nations, where there is a stabbing not to be missed for it is something that could not take place in today's terms.<br /><br />The end of the movie is a classic cliffhanger that takes place atop the stone faces of Mount Rushmore! Do not miss this movie! Cary Grant at his best!</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>"North by Northwest" is an in tense film made in the concept of the wrong man at the wrong time, just like in "The Man that Knew Too Much".  Hitchcock is  amaster ofdirection and he has chosen a brilliant cast to go with an equally briniant plot.  The characters delelop well and Cary Grant offers an amazing perfomance of an innocent man chased all over the US in order to save his life and proove his innocence.  Meanwhile romance is thrown in the plot with a mystirious but gorgeous Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />A great addition to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Colorful, gripping entertainment for the whole family, and full of the trademark Master's twists and turns. Only Cary Grant could undertake this perilous journey and keep looking marvelous with no change of clothes. Eva Marie Saint is alluring as the icy blonde who may or may not be in his corner. But it's James Mason's unnerving performance that stays in your memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I hold this to be Alfred Hitchcock's finest film, but to say that rather shortchanges the British genius as it happens to be one of the greatest movies of all time.  North by Northwest is what I would call "old school cool," and there has never been, before or since, a more charming or likeable actor than Cary Grant.  I dare anybody to take their eyes off this one--even to go to the bathroom.  This marks the third time I've seen it and I found it just as fulfilling as the two before it.<br /><br />James Mason was an amazing actor and I'd place him just below Olivier on the talent meter.  Here he plays a perfect nemesis for Grant as a foreign agent who "imports/exports" information to the east during The Cold War.  In this role, Mason is quite believeable.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is exceptional and the love that develops between herself and Grant is something that the audience readily buys into.  There's nothing contrived about their relationship.  It makes the movie just as much a romance as a thriller.<br /><br />Unlike the movies fabricated today, there is no sex or nudity to be seen here, but we are made to fully understand the emotions of the characters.  The dialogue between Grant and Saint is absolutely precious, particularly when they meet on the train and speak in the dining car.  Words like these are seldom heard in the movies of the present: "How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?"  And my favorite:<br /><br />"Men like you don't believe in marriage."<br /><br />"But I've been married twice."<br /><br />"See what I mean."<br /><br />One wishes that some of these exchanges were examined before screenplays were stamped out in this new century.<br /><br />The entire movie is shot in the "man alone" motif as Grant, ala Gary Cooper, stands up to forces far superior than himself.  His resourcefulness is the glue that binds the plot together. This advertising executive is quite successful in outpacing East German (presumably) agents and the police who are out to hang him. The ending is marvelous but, of course, in case you're one of the rare people who has never seen it, I will not give the climax away.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>It's one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, even if the plot makes less sense than usual. There's nice chemistry between Grant and Saint; the set pieces are unusual, especially the crop dusting; Grant's mom, Jessie Royce Landis, has sardonic style and it's pleasant to realize that they were both born in the same year. Leonard (Martin Landau) with a crush on Mason is also great. The train through the tunnel at the end is an excellent example of how Hitchcock could be naughty without being explicit.<br /><br />Most of all, in my view, Hitchcock and Grant have a worthy adversary in James Mason. The guy was a superb actor, a genuine heavy weight, and he brings such style and menace to the part. I think he easily matches Grant in the suave department.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>One of Hitch's best and most effortless suspense movies has the benefit of a brilliant, witty script by the late Ernest Lehman and star performances by Cary Grant as the put upon Thornhill (whose initials are R.O.T. a nice representation of what's happened to his world), the sexy Eva Maire Saint, the menacing Martin Landau (in his first film role)and the charming but deadly James Mason.<br /><br />Grant plays Thornhill an advertising executive who, through a case of mistaken identity (he raises his hand calling for someone to come take a telegram at the exact moment that a telegram is announced for Mr. Kaplan). As a result, he's kidnapped, taken to the country retreat of a diplomat by the name of Vandamm. Vandamm (Mason)believes that undercover agent Kaplan has too much information about his spy ring and plans.<br /><br />He has his men get Thornhill drunk and they put him behind the wheel so he can have a fatal auto accident. Fortunately, Thornhill survives. He's determined to find out who Kaplan is and what Vandamm really wants. From there Thornhill's life spirals out of control as Vandamm tries to have him killed during the famous cropdusting sequence and convince his lover Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint)to become involved with him and, later, betray him. There's so many twists and turns in this hairraising classic that you have to see the film to appreciate the beauty of the direction, writing and performances.<br /><br />This new spruced up digital transfer looks terrific. Warner evidently had the film digitally restored (not quite as painstaking as the restoration for Vertigo, Rear Window and Lawrence of Arabia but considerably less expensive)so that the colors are closer to the original release prints from 1959. The soundtrack has been beautifully remixed for 5.1 Dolby Digital. While the soundtrack can't completely take advantage of the remix, it sounds terrific. There's also a really good feaurette on the making of the film featuring Landau, Saint, Lehman and Patricia Hitchcock.<br /><br />The inclusion of Ernest Lehman's nicely detailed audio commentary is a nice extra as well although it's clear that some of the same comments show up again in the documentary.  Bernard Herrmann's marvelous music score is isolated on one track so that music fans can hear the original score in all its glory.<br /><br />North by Northwest was the next to last in a string of classics directed by Hitch during the 60's (Hitch only made one movie in the 60's that comes close to his best films and that's the brilliant, dark The Birds). After a string of great movies and box office smashes including Rear Window, To Catch A Thief, Vertigo, The Trouble With Harry, Strangers On A Train and other lesser known works, North By Northwest was a brilliant conclusion to a decade that showed enormous growth in Hitch's directing ability and style. Psycho which would come out the following year would continue Hitch's groundbreaking approach to cinema as well but North by Northwest was the last of Hitch's complex thrillers to capture the public's attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VUO1LJGMSZQY.html">A3VUO1LJGMSZQY</a><br/><p>1st saw approx 5 yrs ago, and yeah, it was ok.  Recently decided to revisit with purchase of 50th anniv. 2-dvd set.  Wow! I must have been asleep the 1st go around! Everything about this film clicks: writing, directing, acting, cinematography, scoring, and the sheer class of it all. Disc 2 has 3 hrs of substantial extras, incl. 90 min. spotlight on Cary Grant, and 60 min.  on A.H. himself ("the master's touch"). All in all, a superb set. The visual quality is top drawer, but can any one tell me if the blu is a significant improvement over this dvd (before I purchase yet again!)?  (thanks in advance)</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />I would rank North By Northwest (1959) as one of the great movies from Alfred Hitchcock's prime, which, in my opinion, was the period from 1954-1964.  This movie was sandwiched between two of his greatest movies, Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960).  Basically the plot involves an innocent man who is chased from New York to Chicago to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota by agents who want to stop the man's interference in their plans to smuggle microfilm that contains government secrets.  It's a case of mistaken identity.  He's abducted, chased by these agents, and framed for murder.  Cary Grant gives a great performance in the role of Roger Thornhill, the innocent man being mistaken for somebody else.  James Mason plays the villain Phillip Vandamm, one of the agents in pursuit of Thornhill.  Mason was always great playing villains (think Salem's Lot 1979).<br /><br />Hitchcock always liked to use good looking blonde women in his movies.  Think of Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, 'Tippi' Hedren, etc.  Eva Marie Saint fits this mold perfectly.  Her acting and screen presence are good in the role of Eve Kendall, a counterspy who is working with the agents, but assists Thornhill by hiding him in her cabin on a train heading for Chicago.  That's all I want to say.  Watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />The opening credit sequence is a classic.  The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and matches up well with the action on the screen.  The movie has a lot of action.  Some of the scenes have become iconic through the years.  The movie of course has a lot of suspense (as you would expect from Hitchcock).  The DVD's clarity is excellent.  Disc 2 contains over three hours of extras, including documentaries on Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock, the movie's iconic status, and the making of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best Hitchcock movies ever and I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>There are few films I have in my film library that is as consistently pleasing as this one.  Even though we have nearly memorized every detail, each time it is as fresh, intelligent, funny, and suspenseful as ever.  This is one of our all-time favorites.<br /><br />RoT, the normal man played by Cary Grant, is one of Hitch's greatest creations.  He is naive about the situation he has fallen into, but turns out to be resourceful and intelligent enough to stay alive through the most daunting of threats.  In the beginning, his skeptical mother is there making sarcastic comments about his explanations with a low key matronly scorn.  But RoT is also full of dark humor, even in the ruses he employs to escape or save his skin.  The disorderly scene in the auction house, for example, is absolutely classic and we laugh at it every time.  Grant's timing is perfect.  Then, when he buys in to what is happening, he takes the initiative with admirable cunning.  Even the love scenes and the exquisite chemistry between Grant and Eva Marie Saint are believable.  The other actors, such as Landau, are first rate.<br /><br />Though produced at a more innocent time when the CIA was generally in a more positive light than it is today, Hitch's touch makes it instantly suspect to the point that the viewer will question its competence and motives.  In a way, the spy they are chasing is more sympathetic, and certainly has more style.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  It is a true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>This Alfred Hitchcock film is a definite classic.<br /><br />It features Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) as a victim of mistaken identity.  He is thought to be a spy and has several 'bad guys' trying to kill him.  When Thornhill starts his day, he is just a regular businessman.  Before long, his world is turned upside down.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint plays Eve Kendall who is Thornhill's love interest.  She also wears some other hats in this movie.  I will forego mentioning more about her to avoid any spoilers.<br /><br />The action ranges from the United Nations building in Manhattan to the top of Mt. Rushmore as well as several others in between.<br /><br />There are several twists and turns throughout.  This is a very good show that is well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />Movie`s hero:  "My wives divorced me."<br />Movie's heroine: "Why?"<br />Hero: "They said I lived too dull a life."<br /><br />The above dialogue is found near the end of this classic suspense movie that is even today unparalleled in producing an optimal combination of plot, humour, action, mystery, and intrigue without resorting to clich&eacute;s.  It was directed by "The Master of Suspense," the great Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />Look for Hitchcock's characteristic brief cameo appearance after the opening credits.  Some say that there is a second cameo.<br /><br />Briefly, our hero in this movie, mid-mannered advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is plunged into the bizarre world of spy (James Mason), counterspy (the heroine in this movie played by Eva Marie Saint), is kidnapped, framed for murder, chased, and even crop-dusted.  I should also mention that he "visits" Mount Rushmore and gets up-close to the faces of former U.S. presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln) carved on the mountain.<br /><br />The debonair Cary Grant effectively carries this movie.  (This was Grants fourth and final teaming with Hitchcock.)  Kudos must also go to the terrific supporting cast of Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau (who plays the spy's main henchman), Jesse Royce Landis (who plays Thornhill's mother where in real-life Landis was only eight years older than Grant) and Leo G. Carroll (who plays the head of the C.I.A.).<br /><br />Another key ingredient of this movie is its background music.  This fantastic orchestral score was composed by Bernard Herrmann.  It effectively adds to each scene.<br /><br />Where does the movie's title come from?  There are actually many theories for its origin.  Personally, I think it comes from the fact that as the movie proceeds, Thornhill travels north on Northwest Airlines.  (One of the original titles for this movie was "The Man in Lincoln's Nose.")<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of those movie gems that, in my opinion, deserves to be called a "classic."  Roger Thornhill's ex-wives were wrong.  He definitely does not have a dull life!!<br /><br />Recommendation: watch this movie on as large of a screen as possible.<br /><br />(1959;  2 hr, 15 min;  wide screen;  46 scenes;  colour)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>Ernest Lehman's screenplay for 'North by Northwest' must have caught Hitch's eye from the start--it's so typical of the kind of film he loved to make (a man on the run from unseen or unknown enemies). He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor and sexual innuendo with the usual blonde femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint) providing a good number of delightful moments. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.<br /><br />It's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist. He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.<br /><br />As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows. An all-time great that has to rank as one of Grant's and Hitchcock's best films.<br /><br />Trivia note: Watch the goof in the scene where Eva Marie Saint shoots the gun at Grant in the dining room. A small boy at a nearby table in the background covers his ears to muffle the shot just before anyone is aware of the gun's existence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>When Roger Thornhill is mistaken for a spy named George Kaplan and abducted by some very bad guys, no one believes his outrageous sounding story. His kidnappers are good at covering their tracks and even Thornhill doesn't realize that George Kaplan doesn't really exist! Thornhill (played by Carey Grant) must find out who Kaplan is, what the bad guys want with him and how to clear his own name in a murder he didn't commit. There are great 'one-liners' and an unforgettable plane/human chase that helps this movie stand out as one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

Bear with me while I simply point out the following:<br /><br />This is an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Hitchcock is regarded by many as the best movie-maker of the twentieth century. Furthermore, NBNW is is not just any Hitchcock movie, it's generally considered one of his best.<br /><br />The story begins with a classic case of mistaken identity in which our hero (played by Cary Grant) gets caught up in a case of international espionage. As the story unfolds, it's hard to be sure who can be trusted and who can't. The plot twists and turns, carrying the viewer on a roller-coaster ride from city to countryside and from the east coast to the Dakotas. The cast is excellent, several of the scenes are among the most memorable in cinematic history, the background scenery is often spectacular, and the music builds on the story's shifting moods extremely well.<br /><br />NBNW is a genuine Hollywood classic. The American Film Institute currently has in the fortieth position on its list of the 100 greatest movies and it's in the fourth spot in the sub-category of the 100 greatest movie thrillers.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock made a slew of great movies. While a few (i.e. PSYCHO, THE BIRDS) are probably better known, NBNW and REAR WINDOW are my personal favorites. Both are simply excellent. Coincidentally, the proprietors of this web page are currently offering NBNW and REAR WINDOW together as a package deal. If I didn't already own both flicks, I'd be all over that. So, this is your chance to pick up two great movies in one quick purchase. My advice? Don't miss out. Get both. You won't be sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>The period betweeen 1958 and 1963 was perhaps the most productive time in Alfred Hitchcock's career. In those five years, he made what are arguably his four greatest films: "Vertigo", "North By Northwest", "Pyscho" and "The Birds". It's hard tp pick which one of those films is THE best, but I think those are his four best films.<br /><br />The second movie in that quartet, "North By Northwest" is the subject of this review. Cary Grant reteams with Hitchcock for his fourth and last film with the Master of Suspense to play Roger Thornhill, a Manhattan advertising exec who is mistaken for a spy and is kidnapped by an organization trying to shut him up. Their leader (a menacing James Mason) as well as his ruthless henchmen (includign a young Martin Landou) will stop at nothing to see Thornhill out of the way, as he frames him for murder, chased across the country, and in one of the finest and most parodied scenes in motion picture history, nearly mowed down by a crop duster. To elude from harm, he enlists the help of beautiful counterspy Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). However, the enemies get wind of this, and now are more forceful than ever. This leads to an unforgettable climax atop Mount Rushmore.<br /><br />Well, wow. This film is incredible. Cary Grant's performance in this film may well be the best of his career. The same can be said for Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. Hitchcock's work behind the camera is very creative. His directing for the crop duster scene is, shot for shot, perfect. The extras are excellent. The featurette is highly enjoyable, as the commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who recently passed on. This dvd is a must for all movie fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>It's one of Hitchcock's later movies. He puts his signature cameo in the first few minutes of the movie, so people will get on with watching it instead of playing the "where's Waldo" game of finding him.<br /><br />It's also an American classic. Some of the scenes have truly become part of the culture's visual memory: the crop-duster chase, climbing across Mt. Rushmore, and of course the train and tunnel. It's a good action movie, 1950s style, with Cary Grant - what more needs to be said?<br /><br />Here in the next century, perhaps a few more things. This is remarkable as an artifact of the cold war, which provided entire basis for the plot. It's also noteworthy as a snapshot of 1950s style. I don't just mean clothes, though the women's styles have a quaint look now. I mean the railroad sleeper cars (do they even exist now?), the Prairie School architecture as the height of sophistication, and the morals of a simpler era. I'm also interested in that chase across that most reconizable of American monuments, as if the gunfire represented an attack on all of America's citizens at once. Well, I guess that's how the Cold War eye really saw the world.<br /><br />Among Hitchcock's movies, it's not the one that builds tension the best - "The Birds" is a lot more nerve-wracking, for example. It's still a good one, for itself and for the 1950s sensibility that it has frozen in time.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>One of Hitch's best! Roger Thornhill is no more a secret-agent than he is a brain-surgeon and yet he gets so believably swept into this suspenseful drama that you might think that you have missed something early on! The superb direction of Alfred Hitchcock combines perfectly with the Academy Award nominated screenplay of Ernest Lehman. The performances of Cary Grant,Eve Marie Saint,and James Mason are equally superb!</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest is by far his best film.  The production, screenwriting, and musical score made this classic what it is after 45 years.  This film has indeed deserves its coveted place among the American Film Institute's 100 all-time best films.<br /><br />The actors along with the plotline pulled the film off with flying colors.  However, Hitchcock uses the same cat and mouse espionage that he used in his earlier film, Saboteur,, which captured the fear and paranoia of World War II.  Despite that somewhat unoriginal film idea, Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau were quite convincing in this thriller of a film full of suspense and intrigue.  And the romance between marketing advertising executive,Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant),  and stranger on the train, Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint) did not hurt the film at all. What would a Hitchcock film be without that tinge of femininity and Eve Marie Saint's glowing profile?<br /><br />This is one of those films where you're rooting for the "good guy" over the "bad guys".  Indeed, this film has political overtones of the Cold War and McCarthyism.  Could this be a film with nationalistic fervor?  Could this have been a film about US consumerism and the sinister USSR?  Possibly, but it's a "hot" picture amongst the "coldness" of the period.  It captures the American landscape with New York's metropolis, which includes the UN building.  In addition, the wheat fields of the Midwest to Mount Rushmore keeps you hanging at the edge of your seat; Cary Grant holds on to dear life both from a crazed-out cropdusting plane to the heads of Jefferson, T. Roosevelt, Lincoln,and Washington.<br /><br />This film is perfect for the movie buff or anyone who enjoys watching a well-crafted film.  Indeed, the 1950s had not been all about the neat fixings of suburbia and "Leave it to Beaver." You had Alfred Hitchcock to draw you back to reality, but in sophisticated film form.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Marvelous old film with Cary Grant, who really made very few truly bad movies.  It's a romance, it's a comedy, it's a thriller - three genres that only someone of Alfred Hitchcock's myriad talents could pull off so well. Grant plays an ad exec who the enemy mistakes for an undercover agent; when he realizes the bad guys are after him with intent to do serious bodily harm, he of course takes off running, leaps onto a train, and meets Eva Marie Saint. Romance ensues amid continuing skullduggery. There are several unforgettable scary thriller scenes, including the chase by a plane in the middle of a cornfield and the final beauty on the face of Mt. Rushmore - and the final, final scent back on the train with EM Saint.<br />Top notch entertainment that never gets old.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This movie is frightfully good because it captures you into it.

The musical score(Bernard Hermann) spells trouble even in the opening credits,the camera angles are signature, his favorite actors(Cary Grant Eva Marie Saint, Leo G. Carroll),and the edge of your seat story. All the things we love.<br />It gets better though, if it weren't for the style of clothes and cars, you would think this film was made yesterday. Warner Bros. has made a beautiful transfer of this 1959 classic, "North by Northwest", onto DVD.<br /> A little of the story though for those who have not seen it(not too much though,don't want to spoil anything for you). It's a case of mistaken identity. Grant's. He is taken for a goverment agent by some counterspies, abducted, framed for murder and nobody believes his story. He goes on the run from the police as well as the thugs.While on the run he meets the beautiful Eva Marie Saint and sparks fly between them.

Maybe even triple crossed? Find out as the thrilling chase goes from New York to South Dakota. And check out all the great scenery and landmarks along the way, as Cary travels by train,is chased by a plane(very scary stuff)and ends up atop of Mount Rushmore.<br />  It's one of Director Alfred Hitchcock's greatest thrillers.Grant,Saint, and Carroll, well, they shine as usual.And along for the ride also thrilling us are James Mason and a young Martin Landau. There's also Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's mother who's wit matches his quip for quip. She's great.<br /> Now back to the DVD. It should be the poster child for why we love DVDs now. I have never seen this film look so good. Picture sharp, widescreen(matted) gives us great views, and the soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 is amazing for a film of this age.It's a film to be watched over and over(and now that it's on DVD you don't have to worry about it wearing out!)If you can't get enough there's several features, the making of,audio commentary,still gallery,audio only if you want to hear just the score,trailers, and subtitles.Hitch fans..you'll love it.<br />  Oh by the way...do you know where Hitch makes his cameo appearance in this one? Of course you do, but just in case...don't miss the first 5 minutes.<br />Goot Eeeevening...and have fun......Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Wedged between two exercises in the psychosexual ("Vertigo" and "Psycho"), Alfred Hitchcock made a truly entertaining chase flick. "North by Northwest" features a cross-country joy ride of familiar landmarks as Cary Grant's "Roger Thornhill" tries to elude both the henchmen of James Mason (SUPERB!) and our own government (headed by Hitchcock stalwart Leo G. Carroll). Eva Marie-Saint, though not as alluring as other Hitchcock "blonds" adds the right blend of mystery and sex appeal to her character. Martin Landau, in an early role, is featured as Leonard, Mason's right-hand man.<br /><br />The movie also sports a brilliantly exciting Bernard Herrmann score.<br /><br />So, set your travel plans to include a trip "North by Northwest."</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who gets mixed up in espionage when he is mistaken for a secret agent named George Kaplan.  He meets up with the beautiful and mysterious Eva Marie Saint and the two embark on a dangerous game of cat and mouse that culminates in a chase across Mount Rushmore.  <p>This is a suave and intelligently scripted entertainment, although it is quite contrived at times.  After all, could anyone really  cradle a dying man and pluck the knife out of his body by accident the way Grant does at the UN?  And, handsome though he may be, Grant seemed a little old for a hottie like Eva Marie Saint to be throwing herself at him without an ulterior motive.  It seemed odd to me that he never appeared to question that her attraction to him was spontaneous and genuine.  Maybe I'm nit-picking.  James Mason and Martin Landau are fantastic as the villains!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>Every element in North is done to perfection Hitchcock is at his most self indulgent and that is a good thing in this case. The color pops thanks to the tranfer to dvd and the script is as beautifully written as Shakespeare! The film begins with a hilarious situation playing on Grant's under comedic timing and never stops or slows down. The injokes are plenty between Mason and Landau's characters less than subtle sexual interest in each other. You have to be really sharp to catch it but it's evident or Eva marie Saint's dubbing of &quot; I never have Sex on an empty stomach&quot; The Rushmore scene alone is worth the purchase if you are looking for a film that throws every element from one of the best film directors and creative geniuses of all time into one of the best action films. The plot takes more twists and turns then juice through a crazy straw. We go from hotel room, sex,  torture, to Grant running in a corn field being chased by a crop duster that comes through with such percision, that you think its gonna crash in your house! Hitchcock is simply amazing!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>A case of mistaken identity leads to kidnapping and more, in the suspenseful "North by Northwest," directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant.  Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has his lunch interrupted by two men who think he's someone else, a man named Kaplan, and as they escort him from the restaurant at gunpoint to a waiting car, it's only the beginning of an adventure that will take the hapless Thornhill from New York to Mount Rushmore, and introduce him to the kind of intrigue few people experience except in the movies.  And before he's through, Thornhill will have scaled the famous monument, played tag with a crop-dusting airplane and fallen in love with a beautiful woman.  It's a classic case of an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events, and with Hitchcock behind it all, you know it's going to be a thrilling ride.  And it is.<p> With this film, Hitchcock proves once again that he is, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  With terrific foreshadowing, he has a way of tipping you off to what is about to happen, without letting you in on what's really behind the mystery.  It's part of that special touch he has that keeps it all exciting and moving along, while allowing the tension to build until the very end.  It's a precision balancing act-- keeping the story right on the wire while refusing to reveal any more than is necessary at any given point in time-- that few directors have managed to achieve so effectively.  Hitchcock has an eye for detail, an innate sense of what works and knows just when to infuse some humor into his story; but a big part of his success is also that he knows how to exact the kind of performances he needs from his actors.<p> Grant, as expected, gives a first-rate performance as Thornhill, using his natural charm and style to great effect; It's understated, and entirely credible.  His reaction to being kidnapped is totally honest, as he affects an almost naive sense of well being even with a gun stuck in his ribs.  As you can imagine it would be in a real situation like that, he simply doesn't comprehend what's really happening.  And the transition from that point to when he fully realizes the danger he's in is extremely well handled and developed.  It's a good bit of acting by Grant, and directing by Hitchcock.<p> Also turning in notable performances are James Mason, suave and menacing as Phillip Vandamm, Thornhill's adversary, and Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall, the woman Thornhill meets on a train and with whom he becomes quite taken, not only with her beauty, but by her candor, as well.<p> The great thing about Hitchcock is that he sets you up so beautifully and never fails to deliver.  He consistently gives you that sense that something is about to happen, and it always does.  When Thornhill is standing out in the middle of nowhere at a crossroads, surrounded by nothing but fields, and you see a crop-dusting plane making a pass in the distance, and then you see it again-- but Thornhill is paying it no attention whatsoever-- you know something is up.  And from that innocuous lead in, Hitchcock develops one of his most memorable scenes ever, brilliantly conceived and realized.  The same thing happens when Thornhill and Eve find themselves at the top of Mount Rushmore; you know they didn't wind up there by accident.<p> The supporting cast includes Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill), Leo G. Carroll (The Professor), Josephine Hutchinson (Mrs. Townsend), Philip Ober (Lester), Martin Landau (Leonard) and Edward Platt (Larrabee).  An exciting story, some engaging performances and the indelible images this film plants in your memory, all make "North by Northwest" one of Hitchcock's finest (and that's saying a lot).  Thoroughly entertaining, it's one to which you can return time and again and still be thrilled anew.  You can always rely on Hitchcock to give you a good show, and show you a good time; that's the magic of Hitchcock, and it's the magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Less resonant than &quot;Vertigo,&quot; more complex and layered than &quot;Rear Window,&quot; &quot;North by Northwest&quot; has something for everyone.  The title is from &quot;Hamlet,&quot; especially appropriate because of the film's plot movement from NYC to South Dakato and because of the protagonist.  Grant plays a character running from a protective mother, encountering a threatening version of Ophelia, and all the while putting on various &quot;antic dispositions&quot; while seeking to claim his own national identity and personal autonomy.  Hitchcock has not only taken his British actor but his own British classic, &quot;The 39 Steps,&quot; and transformed them into cinematic icons as recognizably American as Mount Rushmore.  The protagonist's flight starts from the United Nations and threatens to take on an international theme until the thrilling and delightful climactic action sequence.  The dispossessed hero on the run, Archie Leach, instantaneously becomes the American object of desire--Cary Grant--and Hitchcock becomes the consummate exploiter of American moviegoers' fears, dreams, desires in a segue that collapses fear and desire, death and sex into a closing moment as characteristically American as any conclusion in film.  Besides this unforgettable edit, the film contains one of Hitchcock's 3 most celebrated editing sequences: the tennis match from &quot;Strangers on a Train,&quot; the shower scene from &quot;Psycho,&quot; and in &quot;North by Northwest&quot; the low-flying plane that threatens to harvest Gary Grant.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>Cary Grant: Hero.<p>He tries to save his own face<p>And George Washington's</p></br><a href="../users/A3BFJFJRXMWXAX.html">A3BFJFJRXMWXAX</a><br/><p>For those of you who are Hitchcock fanatics, pleased with only the most complete and perfect versions of his films, keep looking.

This film deserves MUCH, MUCH more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The addition of pretense can be a killer in a film. It is precisely the lack of such a quality that makes Alfred Hitchcock's two and a quarter hour long 1959 color thriller North By Northwest a better and more enjoyable film than his preceding film, Vertigo, even if the film comes nowhere near the excellence of his following film, Psycho. Whereas the two films that end in -o attempt to impose a deeper psychology into their screenplays, North By Northwest is a popcorn eaters gala pre-James Bondian Cold War thriller. It's no wonder the film was a popular smash while Vertigo was a financial flop.<br />  On a strictly logical level, little of the film makes much sense, but it's Hitchcock, after all. As example, what is contained on the microfilm that is the film's MacGuffin- inside the statuette, is meaningless and beside the point- which is action and thrills. That there is no logical reason for Cary Grant's character, Roger Thornhill- another Hitchcockian wrongly accused man, a Madison Avenue advertising executive, to be mistaken for the non-existent spy George Kaplan, is another problem. Yet, even though it is done in a rather unconvincing fashion- Thornhill summons a hotel attendant who is paging Kaplan, and the chase is on- few people will debate cause and effect in a film like this. The dopey bad guys see this brief moment and assume everything- a perfect example of the dumbest possible action propelling the plot, which is usually an artistic killer. However, on the plus side, this is one of Cary Grant's best and Cary Grantiest roles. He is charming, delightful, suave, and the fact that he never seems to get a hair out of place in assorted acts of derring-do, even when chased and dusted by that crop duster, in one of the film's most famed scenes, is not a problem, unless one just cannot let the formula silliness wash over them.<br />  On the negative side is the performance of Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall- the lover/counterspy of James Mason's Soviet mole character, Phillip Vandamm. Saint is stiff and wooden, and even less convincing as a romantic lead than many of the other icy blonds that inhabit the Hitchcock universe. Yes, she's beautiful; second perhaps only to Grace Kelly in the Hitchcockian blond goddess pantheon, but she has absolutely no chemistry with Grant.... Technically, the film holds up much better than many of Hitchcock's other efforts, for the process screens are not always readily detectable, as they are in other of his films- save for the scene where Thornhill does not drive his car off a cliff that the bad guys want him to, and the sets constructed for some of the big chase scenes- especially the Mount Rushmore set, are fabulous, even by modern standards. While the cinematography by Robert Burks is solid, there are no eyepopping moments, and the score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his least memorable, especially considering what was just around the corner in Psycho.<br />  North By Northwest, whose title is both manifest- given the film's final setting, and obscure and of unknown provenance- although oddly linked to a supposed quote from William Shakespeare's Hamlet, is not a great film, but it is a terrific movie, and because it is such utter and unrepentant fluff it holds up much better than many other 1950s vintage films, including many of Hitchcock's own overrated `masterpieces', such as Rear Window and Vertigo. Yes, if you are the type who must go over everything with even a coarse toothcomb, the film simply will not work, but if you trust that the fun will leave your mind as unmussed as Cary Grant's coiffure, then watch it. After all, the perfect hair of Cary Grant is never something to be diminished.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GN9I0UYV08LC.html">A3GN9I0UYV08LC</a><br/><p>Cary Grant (1904-1986) teams with director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) for they fourth and final time in this superlative espionage caper judged one of the American Film Instutes Top-100 American Films and Spruced up with a NEW DIGITAL transfer and Remixed in DOLDY DIGITAL STEREO .

The impeccable Cary Grant, looking dashing and fit as ever, carries the movie that is filled with deception, lies, murder, chases, you name it..it's there.  He's joined by one of Hitchcock's ubiquitous blondes, the lovely Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint, and the villain is the dashing James Mason.  In an early role, Martin Landau projects cheesy villainry; Leo G. Carroll bounced back from "Tarantula" as the conniving intelligence director; and Jessie Royce Landis played a rather youthful looking mother to Mr. Grant.<br /><br />The plot should be known to all movie connosieurs by now, but how can one forget the unusual stabbing in the UN; the quiet terror of the biplane's attack; the breathtaking finale on Mount Rushmore.  Ernest Lehman's intelligent script and the always dependable Bernard Hermann's musical score bring this classic to cinematic life for now and ever.  They don't make romantic suspense movies like this anymore!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Cary Grant did well in Hitchcock's thrillers as his usual suave self, that playing himself to perfection.  North By Northwest makes Grant's fourth and last Hitchcock film, the others being Suspicion, Notorious, and To Catch A Thief.  In this one, he plays Roger Thornhill, who early in the film is mistaken by some sinister men for a certain George Caplan, a double agent.  He is unexpectedly hijacked and taken to a manor house, and interrogated by two men, a Mr. Townsend (James Mason) and his assistant Leonard (Martin Landau).<p>Before long, Thornhill is falsely accused of murdering a UN official and goes on the lam.  Fortunately, he gains an ally in Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint), a slender, sophisticated-looking blonde, who conceals him aboard a train, and all because he has a nice face.  However, she seems to be playing more than just one side, as he discovers later.  Things build to a point when Thornhill says, &quot;I'm an advertising man. ... I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives, and several bartenders dependent upon me, and I don't want to disappoint them all by getting slightly killed.&quot;<p>The U.S. Intelligence Agency is aware of Thornhill's innocence, but decides to use him as a decoy to protect their double agent, now infiltrating Van Dam, the villain of this movie.<p>There are lots of innuendos in this film that are pretty risque for 1959.  Eve tells Roger, &quot;I'm a big girl.&quot;  He says, &quot;And in all the right places too.&quot;  In fact the seduction scene in Eve's sleeping car is steamy for the era, but the Hays Code rears it head at the last moment when at the mention of one bed, she makes it clear Thornhill will sleep on the floor.  However, Hitchcock uses Freudian dream symbolism to thumb his nose at the Hays Code when in one scene, he has a train going into a tunnel.  Figure that one out!<p>The suspense element involving Thornhill escaping one situation after another, having a brief pause, only to have to hide or face some new danger keeps this film going.  And the climactic scene at Mount Rushmore is a classic, as is that now-famous scene that innocuously begins when a man waiting at the same bus stop as Thornhill remarks &quot;that plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops.&quot;  Hold on to your hats!  Oh, and the auction scene is both humorous but clever, once one realizes the motive for Thornhill's actions.<p>One funny scene involves a familiar portly older man missing the bus after the opening credits.  Guess who that is?  And Thornhill's lie to Eve on why the police are chasing him:  &quot;Seven parking tickets.&quot;  However, I've observed some ridiculous things.  One, the best way to conceal yourslf if you're a wanted murder is to wear dark glasses.  Uh-huh, right!  Another is, if the person you're talking to suddenly gets killed by a thrown knife, don't touch the knife--you'll be blamed for the murder.<p>Other assets here include Bernard Herrman's music score.  I wonder if Phillip Glass got some inspiration here for Koyaanisqatsi, as some of the frantic violins in NbNW echo that over movie.  Herrman's score at the beginning has echoes of Stravinsky, matching the drawn grid patterns that gradually turn to the glass windows of a New York skyscraper.  A lengthy thriller with some slow pauses inbetween.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>"North by Northwest" (1959) is Hitchcock's slick and polished cross country adventure meets `the wrong man' scenario. When advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for an American CIA agent by the man he is supposed to be tailing, Mr. Van Damme (James Mason), Roger finds himself the victim of multiple attempted assassinations and a harried chase to unravel the mystery behind the insidious girl with whom he's suddenly fallen in love - Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Fueled by an unmitigated desire to make "the" Hitchcock picture to top all others, screenwriter Ernest Lehman creates two of the most memorable set pieces in film history: Roger's frantic escape on foot from a marauding bi-plane, and, the magnificent climax - fleeing across the faces of Mt. Rushmore. Naturally, park officials would not permit this latter scenario to be played out hence MGM recreated the famed landmark on a soundstage using full scale sets combined with matte paintings and rear projection. The results are flawless and thrilling. The film also contains one of the all time blooper shots in cinema: seconds before Eve shoots Roger with a fake gun in the commissary a small child can be seen in the background clutching his eardrums in anticipation of the bang.<br /><br />* This is the same transfer as was made previously available on the single disc of "North by Northwest."  Through a meticulous frame by frame restoration effort, "North by Northwest" looks better than it ever has on home video. Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and solid. Whites are remarkably clean. There are NO age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for an image that is positively stunning from start to finish. Truly, this is one of the best examples of a classic restored to its original brilliance for the digital format. Certainly it is the finest example of a Vista-Vision film restoration out on the home video market to date! The audio has been remixed to stereo with a spatial spread that is engaging and does not betray its 50 year plus vintage. Extras include a very benign documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. It is incredibly long on personal thoughts and terribly short on detailing the production schedule. Overall, not nearly as compelling as the documentaries that accompany Universal's Hitchcock films.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>When you look at North By Northwest closely, you see many parts from Alfred Hitchcock's other films. The premise, a man accused of a crime he didn't commit, was used in The 39 Steps, Strangers on a Train, To Catch a Thief and The Wrong Man, to name a few. Eva Marie Saint, not known as a glamour girl, was remade by Hitchcock to mimic Grace Kelly's cool, blonde beauty. Cary Grant's escape in the auction scene recalls Robert Donat's similar scene in The 39 Steps. The climax on Mount Rushmore recalls the fight on The Statue of Liberty in Saboteur. Even Cary Grant is, in a way, a "retread," having appeared in Suspicion, Notorious and To Catch a Thief. As one film critic put it, North By Northwest is a summation of Hitchcock's work.<p>However, to simply dismiss North By Northwest as a retread would be like calling Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band just another Beatles album. EVERYTHING works perfectly in this movie with memorable scene after memorable scene (Grant's drunk driving escape, the murder at the U.N., the cropduster attack, Mount Rushmore, etc., etc., etc.). Robert Burks' terrific photography greatly enhances the actors and the locations. George Tomasini's editing maintains a crisp pace. Bernard Herrmann's score is a standout, even when compared to his large body of great work (that's really saying something considering his great scores for Citizen Kane, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, Psycho and Taxi Driver, among others). And Ernest Lehman's script is one of the wittiest and most entertaining screenplays in film history. Add to that the great locations like New York City, Chicago and Mount Rushmore and you've got the elements of a classic.<p>However, the film's greatest strength lies in its casting and performances, especially by Grant. Grant, Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll, Martin Landau and Jessie Royce Landis form a terrific ensemble. Grant's performance, in particular, is wonderful. Present in almost every scene, Grant is the glue that holds the film together. With a weaker actor in the role, the film would have fallen apart. Like Hitchcock himself, Cary Grant wasn't truly appreciated during his career and was more than the one-dimensional charmer many people took him for. Grant perfectly conveys the situation of a confident Madison Avenue ad man who quickly loses control over his life. He has to express confidence, bewilderment, sadness, panic, lust, betrayal and triumph and does so magnificently. It's a shining moment in Grant's great career.<p>The DVD is terrific, the best feature of which is a great documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. (Among other facts revealed, the original title of the film was "The Man in Lincoln's Nose). It's a fitting presentation for a great film. Along with Vertigo and Psycho, North By Northwest marks the absolute best of Alfred Hitchcock's work. It doesn't get any better than this just about perfect film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Hitchcock's suspenseful mistaken-identity classic remains daring, original and vibrant enough to hang with the big boys of the modern age. Cary Grant may have been a few years too old for this leading role, but the fast-paced, ever-intensifying script that envelopes him never gives us the chance to sit and stew on it. The concept that powers the whole bag is astonishingly simple, and once it's knocked out of the way in the first act, the picture is then perfectly happy to gradually up the stakes and riff on the premise for the rest of its allotted time. It's a testament to the creativity of the filmmakers that it still feels so fresh and untainted today, in the era of the derivative knock-off, with only a few dated automobiles and touches of public etiquette reminding us it's actually closing in on sixty years of age. Classic, timeless action / adventure / suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When it comes to Alfred Hitchcock pictures, his "MacGuffin" plot style is quite a bit overused (especially by today's standards).  "North By Northwest" contains that same style of film-making.  However, this film is so well-constructed otherwise that it still holds up well over time.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "North by Northwest" follows the exploits of one Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), who is mistaken for another man and happens to fall into a Cold War spy ring led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason).  Along the way, Thornhill is romanced (and does a fair share of the romancing) by Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose character may not be exactly who she seems.<br /><br />In terms of plot, this is one of Hitchcock's best...if only for the first half of the film when the mystery of "Thornhill/Kaplan" is still brewing.  Once the truth is disclosed, however, the MacGuffin quickly becomes apparent and kind of turns the movie into a simply spy tale (and thus it loses a little luster).<br /><br />The acting is terrific, as Hitch makes the "bad guys" genuinely creepy (I mean, Martin Landau's face alone is enough to do that!) and showcases Grant & Saint throughout.<br /><br />Bernard Hermann's soundtrack also deserves a good chunk of the credit for keeping the latter portions of this movie interesting, as those famous Hermann strings refuse to let viewers relax even for a moment during the climactic moments.<br /><br />Overall, "North by Northwest" is a very good Hitchcock effort that deserves watching by any fan of the director or just cinema buffs in general.  A 3.5 ranking would be my exact choice, but because of it being so well-made, I bump it up to four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>What do you get when you combine Cary Grant, Academy Award winner Eva Marie Saint, veteran stage and film actor James Mason and a well-written script with murder, espionage, romance, intrigue & some of the greatest chase scenes in cinema history?

Pay attention to the movie from the beginning, otherwise you'll be lost in the complex and amazing labyrinth of the movie with one of the most-literally-cliffhanging scenes in film.

Incidentally, some Blu-Ray players, when playing standard DVDs, take a little longer to negotiate the layer transition point than many late-model standard DVD players.

The highlight of his week is the play he will be attending with his mother.  But when he pops into the club for a quick drink before the show, he is kidnapped.<br /><br />When he arrives at a country estate, his kidnappers start calling him George Kaplan.  Roger has no clue who Kaplan is and says so quite forcefully.  Whether they believe him or not, he is forced to drink bourbon and left alone in a car to die.<br /><br />The only problem for them is he survives.  Determined to find out what the heck is going on, he sets out trying to track down Kaplan.  His efforts land him as the prime suspect in a diplomat's murder.<br /><br />With his only lead being a hotel room in Chicago, Roger sets out cross country by train.  It is there he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful woman with a secret of her own.  Can Roger find the truth?  Maybe, but he will have to face low flying crop dusters and a chase across Mount Rushmore to do it.<br /><br />This is my fourth Hitchcock film, and the first one I enjoyed.  The story starts rather quickly and is confusing enough that it held my interest the entire time.  Yet is also has some very witty banter and a great romance between the two leads.  The acting is superb, easily drawing me into the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it suffers from a common curse of movies from that era, pacing.  While I found parts of it rather gripping, I found the parts on the train dull and slow.  Yes, it was developing character and building the romance.  But I still found my mind starting to wander.<br /><br />I was about to write Hitchcock off entirely, but after this film, maybe I'll give him another chance.  If you are also unfamiliar with the work of this legend, this might be a good place to start.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This has become a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, with film score by Bernard Herrmann. If the story is not remembered or commented on, everyone is familiar with the scene where Grant is getting attacked by a crop duster while standing in the middle of nowhere "North by Northwest".<br /><br />Roger O. Thornhill &lt;R.O.T> (Cary Grant), mild mannered advertising executive, raises his hand at the wrong time to send a telegram. The page boy is paging George Kaplan so Roger is mistaken for Kaplan (a shorter man with dandruff) and the fun begins.

Any of his movies that have either of these stars were exceptional and could be viewed by the whole family. These movies always dealt more with suspense than showing blood and gore. North By Northwest is one of the most suspenseful of his movies and it has a good romance story to boot. Cary Grant is magnificent playing the innocent bystander caught up in a grand scheme of espionage.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the romantic interest that is a unknown factor. Is she a spy for the bad guys or is she on the side of justice? This movie also contained some wonderful scenery and sets. The Biplane and Mt. Rushmore scenes have some of his greatest camera work ever. The angles used are extremely effective in making you feel you are there. Bernard Herrman's beautiful haunting music adds to the suspense and helps to make this movie a classic Hitchcock.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>Wow! The Blu-ray is the transfer we've been waiting for. It eclipses all previous ones (at least, those I've seen), including the well-done LV.<br /><br />"NbNW" has never been a particularly "good-looking" film. Projection prints were grainy and contrasty, with vivid, vulgar colors. This transfer -- made from the camera negatives, or something close -- corrects these problems.<br /><br />For the first time, we can see just how /beautiful/ "NbNW" is, and the outstanding quality of the cinematography. The scene in which Mason closes the drapes and turns on the lights, while he and Grant eye each other and waltz around the room, has a sense of depth and "tonality" I've ever seen before. Even better is the scene on the train where Grant and Saint engage in "intercourse" while clothed and standing up (Hitchcock knew how to get around the censors! *). It's soft and romantic, a quality quite lost in previous transfers.<br /><br />Interestingly, the matte paintings, rear projection, and static mattes are /less/ obvious than they were in previous versions. The scene in which Thornhill and the Professor walk toward the plane is perhaps the finest example of rear projection you'll ever see. You have to look closely to realize they're /not/ at an airport. **<br /><br />"NbNW" was shot in VistaVision ("Motion-Picture High Fidelty"). It uses what still photographers would call a full 35mm frame (rather than the half frame used for movies), and therefore runs horizontally through the camera. Of all 35mm formats, VistaVision was /made/ for high-definition video. Its basic aspect ratio is 5:3 (within the 3:2 film frame), and it can be matted to wider aspect ratios in the camera or during projection. ***<br /><br />"NbNW" was probably intended to be projected at 1.85:1. This transfer is at the slightly less-wide 16:9 (1.77:1), an excellent choice that fills the HD screen. Nothing is lost, and there are no distracting borders (for those bothered by such things).<br /><br />And let's not forget the sound, because this is a Bernard Herrmann score. As far as I know, this is the first transfer to present all the music in stereo (ditto for sound effects). (The LV had only the overture in stereo.) The sound is fantastically good -- if you're so young you think "digital good, analog not-so-good", you need to hear this. ****<br /><br />I have some gripes. Several shots in the crop-duster sequence have a "splotch" near the center, likely due to a water droplet that dried on the lens. And the brightness of some of the static mattes in the Mount Rushmore sequence flickers quite obviously. These would not have required a lot of work to correct.<br /><br />Another reviewer has criticized the color, and I'm inclined to agree. Male skin tones are excessively warm, even yellowish. This is fine for Cary Grant -- who sported a perpetual Douglas Fairbanks tan -- but most of the male actors look as if they've spent too much time under a sun lamp. Now, get this... excerpts from this transfer used in the supplemental material have more-natural skin tones! Why this is, I don't know, but I've seen it on several recent Blu-rays -- the image quality in the supplements is better than that of the film itself.<br /><br />As is becoming increasingly common for "important" movies, the disk is encased in a souvenir book. It's nice, but substance-free. You'll read it once, then put it aside. (It's a shame such books don't attempt to duplicate the contents of road-show souvenir booklets, but the format doesn't lend itself to it.)<br /><br />As for the film itself, what is there to say? A classic, a perfect example of how Hitch was able to "play" the audience like an organ. In my "Snow White" review, I suggest that it is possibly the most consciously ingenuous film ever made. Hitchcock's films are the polar opposite -- consciously disingenuous. He's not just telling a story, but deliberately manipulating the audience. The audience knows it, but loves it anyhow.<br /><br />Perhaps the most-amazing thing about "NbNW" is the way Hitchcock seamlessly melds humor, suspense, and action. (Grant's ability to switch instantly between restrained-ironic and dead-serious helps.) Only Steven Spielberg has come close. But he'll never be a Hitchcock.<br /><br />* Thematically, "NbNW" is much like "Notorious" -- Ingrid Bergman is a "loose" woman coerced into marrying Claude Rains so she can spy on him for the government. In a famous scene, Hitchcock got around the Code's restriction on how long a man and woman can kiss by repeatedly having Grant and Bergman break the kiss, then start over -- which makes the scene even more sensual.<br /><br />** MGM probably realized that VistaVision would reveal problems not visible in a smaller format, and spent the money for better effects shots.<br /><br />*** Given the high cost of VistaVision prints and the need for a special projector, few theaters were able to project VistaVision as it was meant to be seen. Most VistaVision prints are half-frame reductions, which lose most of the original quality.<br /><br />**** I used to do live recording, and digital comes closer to live sound. But... in the late 50s and early 60s, analog tape recording had reached a level of transparency, "immediacy", realism, and just plain "euphony" you rarely hear today. Simply in terms of "sounding good", this 50-year-old soundtrack is state-of-the-art. (If you want to hear a modern recording that's better -- that is, coming significantly closer to live sound -- try the Rilling performance of Britten's "War Requien".)</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>Quintessential Hitchcock. Made just in between Hitchcock's best films; 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho'. 'North By Northwest' is more lighthearted and fun  than those films, less psychologically oriented and more glossy good old  fashioned entertainment. Hitchcock took the 'innocent man on the run'  dilemma he practically invented in 'The 39 Steps' and then further explored  in 'Saboteur, but perfected in this classic film. In one of the definitive  Cary Grant roles, Grant was in peak form and at his most charming. It's  hard to imagine anyone else as Roger Thornhill or any other person who can  melt women with just a look, only Grant can do that. Endlessly entertaining  and sprinkled with wit and intrigue, one of the classic screen  entertainments. This time Eva Marie Saint is the 'icy blonde' a look that  obviously appealed to Hitchcock and a lot of actresses are living proof of  that; Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Madeleine Carroll, Janet Leigh, etc. There is  an incredibly sexy (and long) kissing sequence that could compare with the  one Grand and Ingrid Bergman had in Hitch's 'Notorious', while not as tense  or as unbearably sexy it's still as memorable. James Mason is excellent as  the villainous Phillip Vandamme and this is one rare occasion when his  voice does not seem distracting in fact it kind of fits appropriately.  Martin Landau is also equally memorable as Vandamme's thug, there are some  homosexual undercurrents to his character. Filled with many memorable  scenes like the assassination in the UN, Cary Grant trying to drive a car  while drunk and of course the now classic crop-dusting sequence that is  pure Hitchcock genius all the way. The cliffhanger ending on Mount Rushmore  is incredibly suspenseful and equally memorable. One of the most constantly  entertaining films of all time, Hitchcock at his peak and at his most  charming. Extras: Hitchcock's usual cameo; this time as the man who barely  misses the bus in the beginning credits. From a scale of 1-10 I give this  film a 10!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's "North By Northwest" is simply one of the finest American films ever made. It is a great example of the skill and mastery that Hitchcock exhibited throughout his career. If you think back, there are few directors that have had as much success as Hitch did throughout his career.<br /><br />Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is involved in the Madison Avenue ad business. What does he do? It's unimportant, so we don't find out if he is President, an Ad Executive or in the mail room. He is quickly mistaken for George Kaplan, a man that some spies would like to have a word with. Forcibly transported to the estate of Lester Townsend, he is questioned by a man (James Mason). When Thornhill refuses to admit that he is Kaplan and tell them everything he knows, he is dispatched. He escapes and then sets out to figure out who George Kaplan is. Along the way, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful blond, and she becomes his ally. Thornhill's journey takes him from New York, to Chicago, to a desolate corn field, to an art auction, to Rapid City, South Dakota, to the face of Mount Rushmore.<br /><br />Simplicity is the key to this film and its extraordinary success. The story is convoluted and may be considered improbable, but who is to say it wouldn't happen? I can't say that, especially as it is set during the Cold War and I have heard of many stranger things happening. The story is also very simplistic. We don't learn anything we don't need to know, and, frankly, it is most refreshing. I mentioned that we don't really learn what Thornhill does. He is involved in the Advertising industry, that much is clear, and it helps set up his lifestyle and his character quickly and plainly.<br /><br />As I watched the film again last night, another thing struck me. In many films today, the filmmaker treats the audience as though they have no attention span and little ability to think. They show us a key piece of evidence, show the character looking at it, show it going into a pocket, later show the character pulling it out of the pocket, looking at it again, getting someone else to look at it again, and then getting some feedback. Each of these acts produces a view of the item in question for the audience. There is a sequence in "North By Northwest" which I want to use to illustrate how Hitchcock did this very differently. Thornhill and his mother (the very funny Jessie Royce Landis, actually only a year older than Grant), visit Kaplan's hotel room at the Plaza. There, Thornhill spots a picture of a group of men which includes the man he thinks is Townsend (Mason), he points it out to his mother and the audience gets to see it. He puts it back on the desk and goes about his business. Later, as he is rushing out, he grabs the picture. Outside the hotel room, he slides it in his coat pocket. We don't see the picture again, but we know it is the same picture. Later at the United Nations, he pulls the picture out and shows it to someone else. Again, we know which picture it is, not because we have seen it again and again, but because Hitch has allowed us to see it once and we are intelligent enough to know what they are talking about.<br /><br />"North By Northwest" was made after "Vertigo" and before "Psycho". It makes perfect sense. "Vertigo" was reportedly a very personal film for Hitchcock. He put a lot of energy into the film was disconcerted when it did not receive the critical praise or box office that he felt it deserved. This is the first time that Hitchcock took the emphasis away from thrills and went for a more cerebral kind of suspense. He really delves into Scotty's obsessions and paranoia. It is a beautiful film and one of his best, but I can imagine that he was exhausted. It is pretty clear that Hitchcock was at the stage where he wanted to experiment a little. I can imagine that he probably felt that he should return to something that would help him get another hit. MGM purchased a book called "The Wreck of The Mary Deare". Hitch asked Ernest Lehman to adapt it for him. Lehman tried, but a few weeks later, he said he didn't know what to do with it. They talked a bit and then Hitchcock remarked that he always wanted to make a film with a chase across Mt. Rushmore. This single idea prompted Lehman to come up with, as he puts it, "The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films". "NbNW" certainly explores territory that the director traveled before, but he brings a mastery to the work that sets this film head and shoulders above the rest. It certainly helps that Lehman created some of the best dialogue ever written. More on that later. So, while "NbNW" doesn't exactly push the boundaries of obsession that he was trying to reach with "Vertigo" or the psycho-sexual babble he tried to explore in "Marnie", it does examine the relationship of Thornhill and Kendall. In fact, the entire film is about relationships. The relationship between Thornhill and his mother leads him further into the mystery. Her mocking seems to make him more determined to prove he was abducted, pushing him further into the mystery. Thornhill's relationship with Kendall is erotic, intense and takes many turns, some of which take the story in new directions. Kendall's relationship with Vandamm is threatened by her relationship with Thornhill, causing Vandamm to doubt her sincerity. Vandamm and his henchman, Leonard, have a relationship that causes more friction between Vandamm and Kendall. The relationships in the film are the most intricately plotted part of the production.<br /><br />Cary Grant has always been one of my favorite actors. He accomplished in his career what people like Schwarzenneger and Stallone are trying to do today. No, I am not comparing the two action stars to Cary Grant, but they are trying to break out of the action molds that they have created for themselves and lengthen their careers by trying other genres. Grant had great success in many genres. Of course, he was a handsome leading man in many romantic films. He also had great success in screwball comedies ("Arsenic and Old Lace" and "Bringing Up Baby"), War films (both serious and comedic) and thrillers (primarily, films he made with Hitchcock, but also notably "Charade", one of his last films). He was versatile and enjoyed a long career. If Lehman set out to make `The Hitchcock Film To End All Hitchcock Films', Hitchcock almost robbed Grant of one of his more memorable roles. They originally considered Jimmy Stewart. Someone suggested Grant and Grant received The Cary Grant Role to End All Cary Grant Roles. Grant is known for his great looks, his sexy accent, his suave character. These all fit perfectly in the role of Roger Thornhill.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is one of the sexiest Hitchcock blondes, perhaps eclipsed only by Grace Kelly. Saint's portrayal of Eve Kendall pretty much defines what this type of character would be in hundreds of other films. She has to play both sides, never revealing too much to anyone, keeping her cool, trying not to fall in love. It is a difficult balance and Saint achieves it beautifully. She and Grant are so sexy together that it makes the films produced today look tame. In every one of their scenes, they are fully clothed, yet manage to create more sparks than any scene in which the actors are partially naked and simulating actual sex. In a couple of scenes, they spar verbally, flirting with each other. One of the sexiest kisses ever is captured in this film. They are kissing in Eve's train compartment and they move around each other, Thornhill's hands roaming all over Kendall.<br /><br />As much as Saint creates a character that defines the role, Mason creates a villain that is very scary without ever using physical force. His voice is so rich and full of character that pretty much anything he says can be viewed as threatening and menacing. He seems the perfect characterization of a spy about to sell government secrets.<br /><br />Martin Landau, in one of his first film roles, creates the role of Leonard, Vandamm's sidekick. Leonard is very devoted to his employer and dislikes Eve Kendall. There are slight homosexual overtones to the character which fit beautifully and help to further complicate the relationships in the film.<br /><br />Hitchcock is a masterful director, but in the case of "NbNW", he had three very notable contributors. Ernest Lehman created a screenplay that is masterful in its simplicity. He created a story that is suspenseful, memorable and efficient. It moves from one point to the next, never boring us with details that we don't need to know. The dialogue in the film is perhaps the most memorable. Everything is slightly veiled. When Kendall and Thornhill are talking in the dining car, everything they say will eventually lead to their romantic evening. The dialogue is rich and entertaining. More importantly it is not cloying and sentimental. The dialogue also becomes threatening at the drop of a pin, as voice by Vandamm and Leonard.<br /><br />Frequent Hitchcock contributor Bernard Hermann created one of his most rousing scores for "North By Northwest". What struck me when watching the film again is that there are very long passages with no music. You don't hear that in films produced today. John Williams and Ennio Morricone seem determined to prove their worth, overlaying every frame of film with music that is sure to evoke an emotion. In "NbNW", Hermann uses his music to accentuate the suspense or romance, not to substitute it.<br /><br />The other contributor that deserves mention is Bob Boyle, the production designer. He and his team recreated Mount Rushmore in a studio and did a very good job. Just a few brief moments of the chase reveal that it is shot on a sound stage, remarkable really when you consider that none of it was actually shot on the monument.<br /><br />The documentary included with the film is a treat in some ways and disappointing in others. It is great to see Eva Marie Saint again, very beautiful, narrating the documentary. It takes us step by step through the film and the sequence in which it was made. Some great production photos are used to illustrate. I found it disappointing that the documentary made various statements, but then provided no examples. For instance, at one point someone says that they felt tension between Hitch and Grant. Why?<br /><br />"North By Northwest" is my favorite Hitchcock film and certainly my favorite film. It is the first film I remember seeing in a movie theater, on the big screen. It is a perfect example of the magic that Hollywood can create. It is the perfect example of what Hitchcock could create, frightening us, thrilling us, captivating us.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TV6SBCWT7P8S.html">A2TV6SBCWT7P8S</a><br/><p>North by Northwest is one of my all-time favorite movies. From start to finish, NxNW is a roller-coaster ride you'll want to watch again and again. It is thrilling, exciting and at times totally hilarious. Essentially, it's about Roger O. Thornhill, a confident and charming advertising executive, who is mistaken for a government agent and is consequently chased across the country. He is set on the road drunk, forced to hide in train compartments, crop-dusted (a classic sequence), trapped in auction, and finally chased across Mount Rushmore. Movies don't get any better than this. <p>As for the cast, it is excellent! Cary Grant gives a perfect performance as Roger O. Thornhill - and he is hilarious and charming, as ever! Eva Marie Saint is also very good, as the mysterious and glamorous girl Cary meets on the train. James Mason does a wonderful job playing the debonair but evil villian.<p>Directed by Hitchcock, this is a great comedy/thriller - in my opinion, it is Hitchcock's best movie! Additionally, it is a good idea to get the DVD, because the movie is astonishingly sharp and clear and there are plenty of special features. 100% worth your money!

There's a scene where Cary Grant is being chased by an crop duster airplane.  And then there's another scene where killers are chasing Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint on Mount Rushmore.  I remember Cary Grant being suave.  And I remember Eva Marie Saint as being beautiful.<p>Forty-three years have passed since then.  It's time to take another look at this classic. <p>Well, Cary Grant is still suave.  Eva Marie Saint is still beautiful.  The two memorable scenes are still tense with action.  And the Hitchcock style of suspense is there too.<p>But it's no wonder I don't remember the plot, which revolves around Cary Grant being mistaken for an international spy, Eva Marie Saint being a double agent and James Mason and Martin Landau being the bad guys.  That's because, like some of today's technological wonders, the plot is an afterthought, pulled together for the purpose of showing off the &quot;good scenes&quot;.  <p>My opinion on this was borne out by the special features on the DVD, which described the making of the film.  The action scenes were thought up first, and then the story was fitted around them.<p>O.K.  The film is a classic and will remain so no matter what I say.  And memories of those several scenes will live long into the future.<p>But I yearn for a story I can sink my teeth into.  I want to care about the characters.  I want to believe that the action they are going through is possible.  I feel this about films of today.  And I feel this about North By Northwest.  <p>High-tech aficionados will enjoy this flick as a great achievement for Hitchcock given the era he worked in.

I love some of his films; others, not so much.  I give this one high marks for excitement, entertainment, and humour.  My favorite thing in the film, is Cary Grant, who is at his most splendid, elegant, funny best.  Just watching this man for two hours is sheer pleasure.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good.  James Mason gives his usual expert performance as the bad guy who is just charming enough to have won the beautiful blond, for a while.  I usually love Eva Marie Saint but I think that she was not well cast here.  Hitchcok adores his pale blonds but she shines better as a sincere, vulnerable sweetie and doesn't quite pull off the sophisticated double agent role.  I found her attempts at being seductive on the train forced and unattractive. When she shows her true feelings towards the end, she warms up and her real beauty shows.  She looks good, though and there are some great costumes, which apparently Hitchcock picked out for her personally on a shopping trip to Bergdorf's.<br /><br />The woman cast as Grant's mother was only a year older than he was, which seems to be another big mistake.  She is good (reminds me of Stockard Channing) but not at all convincing as his mom.  Also, Grant is just too gorgeous to be going to the theatre with his mother!<br /><br />The most amusing feature of the film, is Mount Rushmore!  Just the idea of having people scrambling for their lives over the faces of our venerable presidents stikes me as very funny--pure Hitchcock.<br /><br />All in all, it's great entertainment.  It's not going to enlighten you or give you great cause to think or stick with you for hours after you see it, but while you're watching it, you'll be glued to the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film starts in late 1950s Manhattan, showing an "advertising executive" Roger Thornhill who is skilled in lying to the public as part of his employment by corporations. Roger attends a meeting, calls for a pageboy, and winds up being abducted in plain view of the public! (Danger in public is a common theme in thrillers, as is mistaken identification.) Roger cannot tell his captors what they want to hear (even if they used torture), so they fill him with bourbon and take him for a ride. This provides an entertaining interlude until Roger stops for the police and is arrested by Sgt. Emil Klinger. The Judge orders an investigation, but they find nothing amiss at the borrowed estate. [No check with the local police?] Roger discovers that no one has actually seen George Kaplan. The abductors show up at the hotel, but Roger escapes one again. [No back-up?] When Roger meets Lester Townsend at the UN, a knife silences Townsend permanently, and Roger is blamed for it.<br /><br />The "Professor" discusses this at the Agency in Washington, where we learn what is really going on - decoy spy. Roger must become his own detective to solve this mystery. The film shows travel on the famous New York Central railroad to Chicago, a bit of history long gone. Roger meets a woman, Eve Kendall, who helps and befriends him. [Was this a theme in the old E. Philip Oppenheim stories?] But we soon learn she is working for Van Dam! Roger arrives in Chicago, then travels to a spot in a flat prairie, and waits. Could there be any danger in the wide open spaces? A crop duster appears to answer this question; there seems to be no escape. The plane crashes (!) and Roger escapes once again. [Wily Coyote could take lessons from him.]<br /><br />Roger meets Eve but is told to go away and never return. There is something mysterious about Eve. Note how Hitchcock was able to create suspense and tension from ordinary life. Roger follows Eve, meets Van Dam and his flunky Leonard, but escapes again. Now the "Professor" meets Roger and takes him to Rapid City SD. There is yet another meeting with Van Dam, Leonard, and Eve. Eve shoots Roger, who is carried away by the "Professor". More events follow as the details of the spy ring are brought out. Eve and Roger make a getaway by climbing down the sculptures of Mount Rushmore. They escape from their pursuers who are caught by the authorities. And so the film has a happy ending, if forced.<br /><br />This was a top film in its day, but now it seems terribly out of date. Films such as "From Russia With Love" or "Goldfinger" are better and less dated than what was Hitchcock's best film. Roger complains against the "Professor" for sacrificing people like pawns, although we learned more in future years. [The "Professor" was a fictionalized version of Allen Dulles, some say.]<br /><br />One of the problems in this film is the crop-duster plane. It would be more probable to send out a car with two men to take Roger for a ride, but less spectacular. This comment also applies to the helicopter in "From Russia With Love". Do they copy each other's mistakes?</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>With a classy Bernard Hermann score, Hitchcock lets us in on the story of an advertising exec, Mr. Thornhill, who likes his job, considering advertising as exaggerating the facts for the public.<br /><br />(Hitch makes one of his famous on screen appearances, and doesn't quite make the bus!)<br /><br />It's fun, though a bit unrealistic, that an advertising man who was just kidnapped would then follow up on the guys who tried to kidnap him, investigate the hotel room of the "real" Kaplan and go through these adventures. But that's fine, it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Each scene has him take a step closer to finding out more about the kidnappers, narrow escapes, chase scenes and thrilling near-misses.<br /><br />The cinematography is superb. The 30th floor view as Thornhill runs out -- the unusual perspective shots, the mistaken identifies and mistaken situations -- the logical illogic, the puzzles and the plots and plans -- All doves together in a crescendo of simple if deadly delights for the viewer.<br /><br />But not for Thornhill.<br /><br />[Some minor plot reveals here]<br /><br />A blonde on the train (but who is she, really?) a little romance & comedy adds to the grim specter of a very long jail sentence or the bad spies rub him out!<br /><br />Best scenes of course include:<br /><br />The biplane scene that sprays bullets rather than insecticide on our poor Mr. Thornhill.<br /><br />The Mt. Rushmore scene that has lots of near misses and very tall heights to climb and nearly be killed by, especially with Martin Landau chasing you down!<br /><br />There's a double-cross, there's James Mason (as actually the evil spy Van Damme), lots of near misses -- I keep saying that but it's true. The film is full of near misses!<br /><br />Recommended, highly so.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"North by Northwest" (1959) is an extremely entertaining film that will keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. Truth to be told, you will never know, because surprises abound in this Hitchcock movie with a plot based on a "wrong man scenario".<br /><br />Do you want to know more? Well, the main character is Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive that is mistaken for George Kaplan, a spy that supposedly works for the USA government. The problem is that he is wrongly identified by foreign spies working in America, who are extremely eager to kill him and not particularly predisposed to believe that he is, in fact, Roger O. Thornhill. That is the reason why Roger faces two choices: to run or to be killed. Needless to say, he embraces the first choice, running for his life whilst attempting to learn more about the real Mr. Kaplan. Roger will get unexpected help from a beautiful and mysterious woman, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). But is she with or against him?. And where on earth is George Kaplan?<br /><br />The answers to those questions are likely to keep the spectator enthralled. Of course, the fact that "North by Northwest"  has a great director, an outstanding cast, excellent musical score (Bernard Herrmann) and a fluid script (Ernest Lehman) doesn't hurt, either  :)  All in all, highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/AR2DE47VCY1C8.html">AR2DE47VCY1C8</a><br/><p><p><br />Format: Color<br />Studio: Warner Home Video<br />Video Release Date: August 29, 2000 <p>Cast:<p>Cary Grant ...

And of course, mistaken for a UN diplomat called George Caplin - our hapless hero George Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) - does just that.<br /><br />Then when the credits end and Cary exits the lift with his secretary (Doreen Lang), all suited-n-booted and looking dapper enough to lick - another element kicks in - the picture quality...<br /><br />The print is just BEAUTIFUL - featuring as it does state-of-the art frame-by-frame restoration. In fact, I raved in an Amazon UK Listmania list some 3 years ago about how good the DVD looked - well this BLU RAY is better - and at times just jaw dropping to look at.<br /><br />Icing on the cake is that this 50th Anniversary BLU RAY reissue also adds on some superlative new features which are just as good as the film itself (nearly 3 hours of viewable features).<br /><br />Here's the full list:<br /><br />1. Commentary by Ernest Lehman (Original Script-Writer)<br />2. New 2009 Documentary "The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style" (over 50 minutes - featuring comments from directors Martin Scorsese, Curtis Hanson, Francis Lawrence, Guillermo del Toro and many more)<br />3. Previously seen, but superlative feature-length profile "Cary Grant: A Class Apart" (over 1 1/2 hours)<br />4. New 2009 feature called "North By Northwest: One For The Ages" examining the movies innovations and influences<br />5. Feature called "The Making Of North By Northwest" from 2000 hosted by Eva Marie Saint<br />6. Music Only Audio Track<br />7. Stills Gallery  (black & white stills of the stars and Hitchcock - both on set and on location)<br />8. Theatrical Trailers & TV Spots<br />9. Internet link to Warner Brothers<br /><br />A whole bunch of things combine to make NBN work - a great story by Ernest Lehman, superb night and day locations, immaculate period clothes, the bulbous gas-guzzling cars, the art-deco buildings, the interiors of wealthy homes and the deeply luxurious dining cars of long-distance 1950's trains. And to top all of that, you get genuine old-school Hollywood star power in the form of James Mason, Martin Landau, Leo Carroll and the luminous love interest Eva Marie Saint. And of course the effortlessly suave and charming Cary Grant - arguably the best leading man Tinseltown ever produced. Throw in the tension, wit and camera angles of Hitchcock at the helm - and you're on a winner.<br /><br />But your eyes keep coming back to how this BLU RAY shines. There are so many little scenes that now look sumptuous - Alfred missing the bus just at the end of the opening credits in his famous cameo scene - the garish colors of Fifties New York taxis, the marble of the Plaza hotel lobby as Cary walks through to meet clients in in the bar. Then there's the Townsend home and gardens as the villains motor up the gravel driveway to the front door, the three dapper suits of the boys as they parry in the library room inside (Mason, Landau and Grant) and the clarity of the night scene where they put a drunk Cary in a stolen car and try to drive him off a cliff. Further on there's the color of the fields in the legendary crop-duster scene, hanging off the Mount Rushmore monument by your fingernails - even Eva Saint Marie's beautiful red dress in the hotel room as she stands by the door while Cary showers in the bathroom... I could go on!<br /><br />If I was to point out one genuine downside, it's the focus. Some scenes quite deliberately have Grant and Saint with an almost halo-like shine around them (soft focus to make them look better) and can at times make the print look just a teeny bit soft, but other than that the whole shebang is a joy to behold...<br /><br />Up there with "The Italian Job", "Zulu",  "Goldfinger", "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning", "2001" A Space Odyssey" and "The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner" in terms of top quality restoration (see my reviews for each) - "North By Northwest" is a triumph on BLU RAY. And the superb additional extras only make you feel that Warners are to be praised for a job well done...<br /><br />Roll on "To Catch A Thief" on the BLU RAY format - another beautiful Hitchcock/Grant restoration currently being raved about (the "Centennial Collection" double DVD set)...</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill has one of those in Alfred Hitchcock's renowned thriller. In twenty-four hours, he has been kidnapped, mistaken for another man, intoxicated with alcohol and arrested for drunk driving and assaulting an officer. To top it off, he is framed for murder, which leads to a nationwide search. Let's also not forget when he is attacked by a cropdusting plane. Throw in a dangerous villain (James Mason) and his mistress (Eva Marie Saint), superb direction from Hitchcock (Who makes a brief cameo in the film's beginning) and an exciting Bernard Hermann music score, you have yourself quite a ride. The movie has several clich&eacute;s that were later exhausted in other movies, but that doesn't detract from the fun. <p>Considering that it is bargain priced, the DVD of "North by Northwest" is a great buy. The film is presented in a Widescreen Anamorphic transfer that's so well done its almost impossible to tell that it is over forty years old. But the extras are really what set this above. "Destination Hitchcock", hosted by Eva Marie Saint, is a documentary about the making of this movie featuring interviews with Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and screen writer Ernest Lehman (Who also does an audio commentary). A theatrical trailer, a "Hitchcock Trailer", a TV spot, a photo gallery, cast and crew bios and an isolated version of Hermann's music score complete this excellent package. <p>Whether you are a fan of one of the stars or of Hitchcock, admire great films or just like entertaining movies, "North by Northwest" should be added to your personal library. <p>Favorite quote:<br />"I have two ex-wives, a mother and several bartenders depending on me."<br />-Roger Thornhill</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>This 1959 Alfred Hitchcock film was the fourth and last "spy" film that he did with Cary Grant.  The others are Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), and To Catch a Thief (1955).<br /><br />I realize that Hitchcock was a close friend of Albert Broccoli (James Bond films)and Cary Grant was the original pick by Albert Broccoli to play James Bond, but the character in this film, Roger Thornhill, reminded so much of James Bond, that I had a hard time trying to convince myself that this isn't a "Bond" film.  I realize that Dr. No (the first Bond film) came out in 1962.  BUT, was Bond's film character patterned on this wonderful movie?  The resemblance is so great, Thornhill even had a martini!<br /><br />Briefly, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a U.S. undercover agent, abducted, framed for murder, nobody believes his story so he's on the run.  He meets a counter spy (Eva Marie Saint) and has one of the longest on-screen kisses with her.<br /><br />This movie has so many great scenes.  Among them are the stabbing at the United Nations (where Thornhill was framed for murder), A crop dusting plane that attacked our running hero (which incidently was the influence for the helicopter scene in From Russia With Love---again, Bond) and the great chase around the presidents' faces at Mt. Rushmore.<br /><br />This film also starred James Mason and Martin Landau.<br /><br />This is one cinema masterpiece!  Watch and enjoy, especially if you like James Bond films, but remember it's not...</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>It seems 2 me that Hitchcock sort of stole many elements from his pre-chaser-films and said: &quot;Good-eeeeevening..... You think you have seen my best efforts, but I must unfortunately dissappoint you.....!&quot;<p>Indeed this is a neurotic and clastraphobic chaser and suspenser - maybe the BEST EVER - thanks 2 the talents of Ernest Lehman, Hitchcock himself, his crew and the entire cast. There are numerous highlights from this film; I prefer NOT 2 single out any of them in favour of others.  This film belongs IN EVERY HOME:-)</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Imagine you're a businessman abducted by the Soviets because you're thought to be an American secret agent.  This nightmare is exactly what happens to Manhattan advertising executive Roger Thornhill (acted by Cary Grant).  Once he is mistaken for the spy George Kaplan, the action never lets up.  Thornhill is thoroughly perplexed, and even his mother thinks his story is completely disbelievable: "I think I'd like to meet these killers."  But the Soviets, led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), really are killers because they are convinced that Thornhill is about to expose them.  As it turns out, secret agent George Caplan, the man whom the Soviets mistake Thornhill to be, is a fictional creation of the Americans to take the heat off their real secret agent.  And so the Americans are eager to convince Thornhill to continue the charade, life-threatening as it is.  Along the way, Thornhill gets involved with the beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).  Or is she a Russian spy herself?  Or perhaps a counter-spy?  It is this combination of romance and intrigue that sets the tone for the rest of the movie.<p>Personally I found the romance rather overdone, particularly the extended and passionate kisses.  Although there is the implied suggestion that the two spend the night together (the trivilization of both casual sex and divorce is a remarkable laxity in morals that was very bold for 1959!), thankfully we are spared any footage more intimate than the kissing.  Thornhill & Kendall's mutual feelings of "love" are pure infatuation based on physical attraction at first sight.  The mention of making love in the first minute of their first conversation is rather absurd and certainly outrageous at the time of production.  Nonetheless, these "offensive" elements are rather tame alongside what most modern movies deliver.  And they are not the focus of attention, since it is really the suspense of the espionage and intrigue that carries the plot and the drama.<p>Of course there are many espionage movies with wonderful suspense.  But Hitchcock's 1959 production delivers suspense without extensive violence, profanity and sex.  The focus is on the suspense and intrigue with numerous plot twists, accompanied throughout by wonderfully dry humor (For instance, Thornhill expressing his reluctance to participate in a charade that could threaten his life: "I have two ex-wives, a mother and several bartenders depending on me!  They would be most disappointed if I got slightly killed.")  There is beautiful scenery and filming throughout - the memorable cinematography of the crop duster attack and the final chase scenes on the faces at Mount Rushmore is superb!  Unlike most modern thrillers, there are times where the action is slow, such as when Thornhill waits alone alongside a desolate road in the middle of nowhere - effectively building up suspense and tension all the more.  As far as cold-war thrillers go, this is a worthy classic of the genre!  Hitchcock serves up delightful humor, spine-tingling suspense, and delightful cinematography, without marring it with much of the moral filth that pollutes contemporary movies.  It's one of the master Hitchcock's best, and is certainly worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>Right now Best Buy has 100's of Blu-Rays on sale for a lot less than Amazon.

This is one of Hitchcock's.<br /><br /> No good purpose is served by pretending to like this movie-seems like the editors and a good chunk of reviewers put metaphorical horse blinders on while watching because an ostensibly "great" director is overseeing it. It's a dumb movie no matter who is at the helm. The comedy is sub-par, Cary Grant is given inane and foppish dialogue as he tries to woo Eva Marie Saint's character, and the intrigue is nonexistent; you can get much more adventure out of the worst of the James Bond films.<br /><br />We all look back fondly on the classics in any medium. That said, a critical eye should separate the wheat from the chaff. Finding this glass-jawed lightweight a great timepiece of the 50s memorable lacks discernment. I will give it one thing...the score is superb. It does alot of the work in terms of atmosphere that the visual part of the flick is unable to provide.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're on a classic movie tear, save yourself a painful 2+ hours and don't bother with this malarkey. Liberate thyself from the tyranny of blind artist worship for the sake of banal vanity.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>gary grant's mother did not look a bit like his mother, more like his wife, the age difference simply non-exist! a terrible cast. the other problem was the attitude the mother towards his son. she simply despised him, but in fact, her son was a quite successful and respectful person in the society. i just don't know why the mother role was so cynical to her son.  some of the plot twists in this movie also looked very pretentious. the genre also losing grip, could hardly determined itself either a thriller or a comedy. so many scenes simply looked too staged and too phony, the absurdity of the screenplay was self-served to be imposed as normal in a common sense, but of course, if the viewers could lose themselves from the logic, anything was possible and acceptable. in that era, most of the popular movies were all like this one, mixed with romance, suspensful twists of the scenario,  actions, thugs, beautiful and mysterious women, almsot non-stop romantic theme music, sound effect synchronized with all the movements and reactions with the actors and every part of the stories. we've watched this movie couple of times before, but this time, after watched it developed into ridiculous and pretentious scene after scene, we just hit the reject button and put it back into the plastic box. you don't have to agree with me, because this is just my personal viewing after thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>The first thing that struck me about this film when I settled down to watch the DVD is that North by Northwest is now forty-seven years old! (Perhaps I should have waited three more years to buy the 50th anniversary special DVD they no doubt will be issuing.) The second thing that struck me is that today's youngsters who are reviewing the DVD for various web sites have been polluted with so many bad modern movies that they can't really appreciate this brilliant collaboration. Sure, they all give film good reviews, but I also read comments such as, "as good as The Matrix," and "interesting despite all the talking." I think secretly a lot of younger reviewers would have liked this film a lot better if it had more fist fights, less explanation, better special effects, maybe a topless scene, and bigger fireballs in the explosions. Instead, we have one reviewer carping that Eva Marie Saint "isn't credible" in her role. Is Angelina Jolie credible in any of hers? Does anyone really believe that ancient Greeks looked like Brad Pitt?  (Check out some of their pottery or mosaics sometime.)<br /><br />Movies have always been stylized to the eras in which they are made. Excellent as it is, even such a "realistic" experiment in freedom as Robert Altman's MASH now has a certain "hyperrealistic" quality. Frederick Wiseman demonstrated a long time ago the introduction of the camera compromises any hope of "realism."  It's a lesson seemingly forgotten in this age of so-called Reality TV.<br /><br />This may seem a long way from North By Northwest, that most classic of Hollywood Hitch films, but it is not. Hitchcock and collaborator Ernest Lehman turned out a film that was a thoroughly thought-through work *in the world that they created.* The director even shut down production one day till he could figure out a how a character in the film could have known a minor but important detail--he couldn't just ask Lehman, because Lehman was in Europe at the time. Can you imagine a director today worrying because a minor detail was irrational??  Films only get shut down today if the shipments of coke stop making it to the set.<br /><br />And this is an airtight world we get in N/NW, with every line of dialogue, every scene, every gesture contributing to the whole. There is no wasted motion. No moments that were there just because they looked good (Lehman and Hitchcock had in mind several set pieces that were dropped from the final story, simply because they couldn't find a logical way to work them in.) Contrast this to something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which though a wonderful film in its own way is filled with scenes that don't really lead anywhere or make sense. (Why not just build Devil's tower in your yard instead of your living room? Why associate hand signals with a series of notes when you don't know what those gestures may mean to extraterrestrials? Why not implant the vision of the mountain into the minds of the scientists too, instead of sending them longitude and latitude readings?) There is something about the way great filmmakers and writers respected audience intelligence back in the days of Hitch and Lehman (and Lean, and Attenborough, and Wise and Wilder and Wyler and Kazan, etc.) that's missing today.<br /><br />Warner, meanwhile, which owns the MGM catalog these days, did wonders with the transfer of this film. It looks stunning, without a single nick or scratch and no sign of fading. Only the 1950s-style technicolor belies the age. The Dolby digital 5.1 sound is crystal clear, with a very vivid and dynamic remastering of Bernard Herrmann's kinetic score (also available as a separate "music only" track if you wish) and some real sound-effects enhancements, especially in the crop-duster sequence. Don't expect THX-boominess, but the film doesn't need it.  For once, DVD menus are effective and clever without being obnoxious and tedious.<br /><br />Included are two trailers--one features Hitch himself in a tongue-in-cheek narration. Both are anamorphic-unusual for trailers--and both are in good shape for their age. There's also an anamorphic B/W trailer made for television. A stills gallery and cast bios are included. Then there's a scene-by-scene commentary from screenwriter Ernest Lehman. It drags in places, but it's interesting to have. (I'd love to have a second commentary track from a film historian as well.) Finally, there's a documentary, "Destination Hitchcock," hosted by one of the few surviving cast members, Eva Marie Saint. It's interesting and well-done, though I would have preferred even more information than is offered here. How, for example, did they manage the huge train station crowd sequences, back in the days before they were adept at shooting in huge public spaces? (Hitch always preferred to work on studio sets, and used rear-projection as much as he could get away with.) Still, this documentary must have been entertaining; I estimated it to be about 20 minutes long when I watched it, and was surprised to find it's actually 40, so time must have flown.<br /><br />You'll never get two people to agree on what Alfred Hitchcock's "best" film or films was/were. Attempting to decide may even be silly--best by what measure? N/NW, though well-done, certainly didn't break any cinematic ground. It isn't the experiment that Psycho, Rope, Rear Window, Lifeboat, and Spellbound were. Yet if you were to ask me what his most "entertaining" picture was, I'd name this one without hesitation. Yet it's more than just entertaining. Without moralizing or pontificating, screenwriter Ernest Lehman manages to get in some sly cuts about the Cold War as well as interesting observations on the overly-insulated, outwardly-prosperous, blatantly-hypocritical America of the 1950s. In a way, he and Hitch were trying to show Americans what was really going on while most people led comfortable, fat lives where advertising companies tried to convince us our breath wasn't fresh enough and our cars weren't big enough. It's the evil lurking just below the surface of Betty Crocker America. In that regard the film is plenty "realistic" and plenty powerful...much more so than the juvenilia of the "Matrix" Trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>NORTH BY NORTHWEST was my favorite Hitchcock film for many years.  I was a  teenager and much preferred Hitch's classy, sexy man-on-the-run film to any  of the films of the 80's (besides STAR WARS!)  The just-released DVD of  this 1959 film looks excellent.  The colors and crispness of the picture  are truly extraordinary.  Again, I praise the benefits of DVD!  And this  disc is such a great example of how to do it right, especially with our  older films.<p>The documentary that accompanies the film is hosted by Eva  Marie Saint (who is still a handsome and classy lady).  Although not as  thorough as the documentaries on recent Hitch DVD releases (MARNIE, THE  BIRDS...) this one will do.  There are some nice behind the scenes photos  and info.  The documentary director seems to skim over everything,  however.<p>My favorite thing about NORTH BY NORTHWEST (besides all the  obvious Hitch directing embelishments...) is the script by Ernest Lehman.  This is a GREAT script.  And no one writes sexy leading man and leading  lady dialogue like Lehman:  &quot;I'm a big girl,&quot; coos Eva Marie  Saint.  &quot;Yes, and in all the right places,&quot; responds suave Cary  Grant.  This is just perfect!  And the sex is implied.  I am not a prude --  it is just so smart the way Lehman &quot;hooks up&quot; Grant and Saint in  the train scene.

THRILLER? DRAMA? LOVE STORY or FARCE?<br /><br />Answer - It doesn't matter, because, North-By-Northwest is one of the most purely entertaining and compelling films ever produced, and it is readily available on a fully-featured, remastered, widescreen DVD.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT - - THE $4,000,000 BARGAIN OF 1959!<br /><br />Mistaken identity is taken about as far afield as it can go, with some wrinkles thrown in, like murder, attempted murder, love, betrayal, and plot twists on plot twists. Add to this, the pace of this film really books!<br /><br />THE HITCHCOCK TRADEMARK TAKES CENTER-STAGE: GOOD GUY WITH A FLAW - ENTER R.O.T.<br /><br />Just like Janet Leigh's character in "Psycho" and James Stewart's character in "Vertigo", the hero in "North-By-Northwest" has a character flaw that's going to cost him big. In Roger O. Thornhill's case he makes a living by capricious, harmless "exaggeration". He is in advertising and in this movie everything that happens to him seems like sensationalism, hyperbole, misrepresentation, stretching the truth, a whopper, overkill, and a lot of bull. All of which are synonyms for "exaggeration", how R.O.T. describes his occupation to put a fine point on it. The effect of this kind of literary justice is to put R.O.T. in a position where he must examine his soul and decide to take a position rather than a viewpoint. In doing this, he reaches a well-earned epiphany for both himself and his patient audience. In the end, his life is not only restored but is new and improved, as they say in advertising, with Eva Marie Saint becoming Mrs. Thornhill as his reward for sincere caring and many unselfish acts. In the end, goodness becomes more than its own reward as it can only be counted on in fiction: ah, but such good fiction was this.<br /><br />THE SETS - -<br /><br />North-By-Northwest was filmed on many locations in the United States and made to look like many more. There are memorable scenes in the United Nations in New York, Chicago, Mount Rushmore and even on Long Island, not to mention on the train with Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant from New York to Chicago. There are On-Location shots and matte backgrounds depicting outdoor sets filmed in Hollywood at MGM. Many of the interesting and unusual sets are explained in the featurette, all of which are well done and are very useful and important to the film's realism, which remains surprisingly intact throughout all the permutations in the plot and scenery.<br /><br />NICE SOUNDTRACK - -<br /><br />LET'S NOT FORGET THE MARVELOUSLY DARK SOUNDTRACK by Bernard Herrmann which made long scenes like Grant's drunk-driving fiasco seem tense rather than tedious.<br /><br />THE ACTORS - -<br /><br />Cary Grant is Roger O. Thornhill, or is that George Kaplan? You'll have to see the film to know for sure. His mother, Clara Thornhill, played by Jesse Royce Landis, isn't even sure, it seems, when Grant's life has been hijacked apparently without cause. James Mason as Phillip Vandamm is the unconventional leader of an international spy ring that has just marked Cary Grant for death. Unfortunately for Grant, but fortunately for us, he has little in common with most action heros so his solutions are also a little unconventional and more sophisticated than the usual Hollywood hero's.<br /><br />The result is fast-paced action entertainment that keeps the large, experienced cast of Hollywood veterans quite busy and the audience guessing.<br /><br />Cary Grant - Roger O. Thornhill<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint - Eve Kendall<br /><br />James Mason - Phillip Vandamm<br /><br />Jesse Royce Landis - Clara Thornhill<br /><br />Leo G.

This is especially so with old movies, which, outside of holiday fare like the Ten Commandments or The Sound of Music, do not make comebacks once a decade or so, unlike clothing fashions.  This is why so many young people have never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  For the longest time, I was one of the ignorant masses, until my mother told me about this great movie-maker.  I picked this up at the local library and watched it, and was amazed.  This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Part thriller, part romance, part suspense and part action, this movie presaged modern Hollywood fare such as The Fugitive, National Security, and Enemy of the State for example.  There is gunfights, chase scenes, set-ups, cliffhangers (literally), and of course the famous cover shot of Cary Grant getting chased by an airplane in an open field.  And like many modern action movies, this one has the climax right at the very end, followed immediately by a cut to the closing kiss of hero and heroine.<br /><br />This DVD restoration is great.  The film and audio quality is flawless.  The special effects are also top-notch and comparable to anything seen on network TV today.  And most importantly, a great storyline.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock knew a recipe for a perfect thriller because he had made many but among his films, "North by Northwest" (1959) stands out as a great combination of suspense, sex, and humor. The film is based on a case of mistaken identity that in a course of a few days makes a likable (even if slightly arrogant) Manhattan ad-man Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) the object of a cross country spy hunt. Having no clue what is happening to him, Thornhill will be kidnapped by the spies, brought to an unknown mansion and after the questioning forced to get drunk. He will get arrested for a stealing a car and drunk driving of which he has no recollection. It is just the beginning. Next, he finds himself in the UN building talking to a man who drops dead in the middle of the conversation in front of hundreds of people. The worst part - the man is murdered and Thornhill has the murder weapon, the knife in his hand. Both, the police and the spies are on his trail and his only hope is to escape NYC by train where a very sexy blonde named Eve (Eva Marie Saint) is ready to help him. Their encounter leads to one of the sexiest scenes ever filmed without any sexual act involved.<br /><br />The film is packed with the witty and funny dialogs and one- liners as well as with artful and imaginative set pieces including Grant running for his life across the prairie from an evil crop-duster and the climatic chase on Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock who always wanted to make a film with two scenes - a chase on the face of a president and the attempt to wake up the Peru Ambassador during the assembly in UN who turned to be dead, had his dreams fulfilled with "North by Northwest" which he suggested should be called "The Man Who Sneezed in Lincoln's Nose". Among many of film's pleasures are Eva Marie Saint as sexy stranger on a train and James Mason and young Martin Landau as a duet of villains with a complicated relationship.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>If you were going to leave ten movies in a time capsule for future generations to see what movies were all about (I know you've played this game before) "North by Northwest" should be somewhere near the top.<br /><br />I forget where I read this but Hitchcock's resume for films goes back to the 20's when he was one of the early craftsman who worked with a moving camera. You know they did have talkies at that time and drama but up to that point it was all done with a stationary camera.<br /><br />So the old professor really had done it all when he came upon the series of movies which made him famous. This was preceded with the sexy, scary-as-hell "Rear Window" with Jimmy Stewart, who along with Grant might have been Hitchcock's other favorite leading man. While Stewart (very courageous man but that's another story) lacked Grant's debonaire good looks and savoir faire, he was (Stewart) ordinary looking and Grant on the other hand could play ordinary.<br /><br />Here in NBNW Grant as Roger Thornhill, just on the wagon, obedient to his Mom even though he's in his 40's, gets mistaken for a double agent by the ever sinister James Mason and we're off to the races. We see the old airports, Love Field and the old American Airlines Eagle as Roger and Eve Marie Saint and Mason and Martin Landau chase each other over the 1950 terrain of the USA.<br /><br />The remarkable thing about Hitchcock is his relentless presentation of the average guy caught in events way, way over his head. Brilliant movie. Brilliant cast. Brilliant Director, really, never to be replaced. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>If you like movies and have not seen this one yet, shame on you.<br /><br />It is a movie movie - big, brassy, and typifying America's bigness and boldness.  It also makes so much of its political time, with resonances beyond the 1950s.<br /><br />I remember seeing a screening of this at a theatre in downtown Chicago in 1974.  There's a scene where "the Professor," the CIA operative played by Leo G. Carroll, remonstrates with Cary Grant.  Grant is being manipulated into continuing to help the CIA (or some other "alphabet soup" agency) conclude its actions against a spy ring, and Grant wants no part of it.  He's then told that his love interest (Eva Marie Saint) is an operative who is in grave danger - placed there by her work for the CIA.  The Professor says, "War is hell, Mr. 'Kaplan,' even if it is a cold one."  Grant replies, "Well, maybe we should start losing a few of them."  The 1974 Chicago audience cheered out loud.<br /><br />So, here we are today - not 1957, not 1974, but 2005.  Watch this movie after Team America and get the joke Hitch put out for us almost fifty years ago:  good and evil will coexist within all political, religious and social infrastructures.  Power corrupts.  Absolutism leads to demagoguery.  What counts is interpersonal relationships and, most of all, trust between people.<br /><br />Great film - airplane sequence is cool, too...</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>This is probably Hitchcock's greatest film.

A great (original) script by Ernest Lehman. One of Bernard Hermann&#65533;s scores. James Mason playing a sinister villain.  Martin Landau and even more chilling villain and in his strongest performance in a supporting role. Eva Marie Saint (who I wouldn&#65533;t have picked for the female lead, but then that&#65533;s why I&#65533;m not the one making movies this good) at her sultry best. Carey Grant, always debonair, the very picture of suave, in the best role he ever had. And the best filmmaker ever: Alfred Hitchcock. There&#65533;s the one-liners that only Grant can deliver. Humor. Drama. Suspense. There&#65533;s a murder in the UN. A chase in a cornfield by a bi-plane, which is one of the most famous chase scenes. And a fight across Mount Rushmore. The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films.<p>I&#65533;ve seen DVD&#65533;s that contain more extras and I&#65533;ve seen DVDs that contain less. This has some 50 production stills, the tv trailer, the theatrical trailer, and the Hitchcock trailer. There is a 40 minute documentary on the making of the movie. The documentary just covers the basics, so don&#65533;t expect all the hard details, but it&#65533;s worth watching. Unfortunately neither Hitch nor Carey Grant were around to do a commentary, so the next best thing, Ernest Lehman, did the commentary. Actually, it turns out that his interview for the making of documentary (in its less edited form)  is what&#65533;s laid out over the movie. Which might explain why there are large gaps of no commentary and why there aren&#65533;t as many insights as to why he wrote a scene one way versus another. You do get some colorful stories about Hitch and the making of this movie, and at one point Lehman goes into detail about the writing of the script. It&#65533;s not the best commentary I&#65533;ve seen, but worthwhile. There is also a music only track for the serious student of Hitchcock. It&#65533;s probably not something anyone other than a film student is going to watch (over two hours with no dialogue and at times no music takes a certain level of commitment). But if you want to see just how effective Hermann&#65533;s score is, there is no better way to do it. <p>North By Northwest is one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies ever made. The DVD isn&#65533;t spectacular but it does contain a few perks.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>1.

This stands the test of time as a sophisticated thriller that is alternately clever and contrived, fast-paced and glamorous.<br /><br />It is the ideal showcase for the debonair but innately accessible Cary Grant, starring as the prototypical wronged man who unwillingly embarks on a perilous odyssey away from the comfortably insulated life he led. Grant seems to thrive best when his character, a successful Madison Avenue advertising executive named Roger Thornhill, is put in inexplicable situations that build into a series of unforeseen events leading ultimately to a seemingly conspiratorial group of spies and assassins by way of a variety of locales that includes Grand Central Station, the United Nations building and Mount Rushmore. For someone used to making up the "truth" in advertising copy for marketing purposes, Thornhill is vulnerable to his own medicine at a much higher cost...his life. After getting abducted by a pair of thugs, he is forced to drink a pint of bourbon under the mistaken assumption that he is a government undercover Federal agent. A murder frame-up follows, and then he is on the run as an implicated suspect. He takes on yet another identity while confronted with even more mayhem and a world of espionage, an unbelieving mother, and Eve Kendall, a mysterious blonde, played with surprising elan by Eva Marie Saint. One wonders why she didn't play more femme fatales during her career...she seems a natural at it. Is it all a little too far-fetched? You bet. But under Hitchcock's sure direction and recognizable visual style, it is also one of the most supremely entertaining of movies.<br /><br />There are a plethora of memorable scenes, set pieces really for Hitchcock to concoct some suspense in order to showcase his unique visual style. These include the wonderful crop-dusting sequence where Thornhill tries to outrun a nefarious biplane into a dried-up cornfield, the knifing of the real Lester Townsend at the UN and the final scaling of Mount Rushmore's Presidential faces to escape the villains. That's where appropriately the final salvation occurs, and Thornhill and Kendall then end up in the upper berth of a Pullman car just as they started. The film is filled with many humorous touches such as Thornhill's drunken scene at the police station (preceded by a rather politically incorrect drunk driving chase sequence), the extended seduction scenes between Thornhill and Kendall on the train, the auction scene where Thornhill is trying to get captured by the police to avoid the spies, and his unexpected marriage proposal as the lovers hang precariously between Washington's and Jefferson's foreheads. James Mason lends his particular savoir faire to the role of duplicitous foreign spy Phillip Vandamm, and a young Martin Landau is appropriately sinister as the sexually questionable henchman, Leonard. Much of the credit for the film's success belongs to Ernest Lehman, who penned the original screenplay, and Bernard Herrmann for his atmospheric score.  The DVD includes a brief, informative making-of documentary hosted by Saint.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.  It is generally agreed that "The Master of Suspense" stumbled badly by revealing the identity of George Kaplan early in the film, in the scene where the CIA members discuss what to do about Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant).<p>Thornhill is a heady advertising executive who is abducted at gunpoint and taken to a man named Vandamm (James Mason) who asks him cryptic questions and keeps calling him George Kaplan.  Thornhill responds that he doesn't know George Kaplan and that they are confusing him with someone else.  Through this entire sequence, we are never sure whether he is Thornhill or Kaplan.  The film would have been far more intriguing if this were left a mystery until the end, rather than having it cleared up twenty minutes into the plot.<p>It is thought that Hitchcock believed that the introduction of Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) would replace one mystery with an even better one.  However, Eve's motivations are too transparent and even of the dullest of viewers can discern that their meeting on the train is no chance encounter.  Eve is far too forward and obvious, especially for the 1950's.  It is hard to believe there is anyone who wouldn't be a tad suspicious at her behavior.  Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.  We would know only what Thornhill knew about why he was being pursued and seduced, which is next to nothing.<p>Despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.  The second half of the film is much tighter and filled with Hitchcock's trademark suspense scenes.  The crop duster pursuit and the chase scene on the face of Mount Rushmore are classic Hitch.  Hitchcock tried to get permission to shoot the scene on the real Rushmore, but he was refused.  Not to be deterred, he had his own Mount Rushmore set built that was indistinguishable from the original, earning an Oscar nomination for set decoration.<p>The acting is excellent.  Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.  Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in "On The Waterfront", but she is every bit as good in this film.  Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.  James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.<p>I enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films ("Psycho", "Vertigo" and "Rear Window").  I rated it 9/10 with a point deducted for blowing the Kaplan question.  Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>This is definitely a DVD to have and to rewatch with friends and family. The story is familiar - a man is mistaken for a spy and has to get out of the mess without dying - but the acting and scenes are fresh and stunning. <p>It's pretty sexual for a film of its time - Roger has been married many times and has no qualms about seducing the beautiful young woman on the train. Not that she needs seducing - in the original version she meets him while eating, and says that she wants to finish dinner because she doesn't like to make love on an empty stomach. Not too bad for a first date!<p>The crop-dusting scene is famous and much-copied, as are several other scenes. It's the interpersonal relationships where this movie shines, though. The jealousy of the two men who both love Eva, the way that James' henchman is fond of him (and jealous of Eva) ... there are romantic pentagons in this film, never mind triangles. <p>The special features on the DVD are well worth watching, giving extra insight into the characters and the way the movie was made. Grab a copy for your home, and another for a friend as a present! It's a movie that you'll find something new in each time you watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>I'm not sure about why the more recent reviewers are having so much trouble with their dvds and I can only assume that the recent batch out of the factory has got major product quality issues as my copy works just fine albeit I bought mine at least a couple of years ago.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound quality as well as the picture quality of my dvd is excellent too.<br /><br />People have to recognise that most of Hitch's films combine elements of humour together with suspense and thrills and what makes this film great is the nice balance of these that's apparent.  The witty dialogue and snappy one-liner jokes delivered by the brilliant Cary Grant still hold up well today.  The Kafka-esque storyline is meant to be so outrageous as to be funny and if taken in that spirit many of the scenes are very entertaining indeed.  The ludicrousness of trying to kill "George Kaplan" by filling him with alcohol and then helping him drive off a mountain's edge, being chased by a crop-duster in the middle of nowhere, etc make fans of Kafka's works like "The Trial" and "Metamorphosis" who can appreciate the genre truly appreciate and enjoy this film masterpiece.<br /><br />Granted some of the scenes do not make much logical sense such as when Eve Kendell talks to Martin Landau's character from a phone booth while he is doing so from another phone in the same line of booths and the strange way the crop duster slams into the oil tanker but that's just the point with Kafka-esques situations in that they are supposed to be ridiculous.  Despite these screenplay "shortcomings" the acting is very good and I liked the camera angles very much for an overall very good film.  Great combination of humour, thrills and spills, tension and drama makes this a classic film for the ages.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 11 May 2011:<br /><br />Amazon will not let me review the 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray Book Edition separately and so I'll have to append it here.  This film does benefit from the 1080p treatment picture quality-wise although the improvement is not a vast one as compared with the DVD release that I wrote about before.  There are also a few frames interspersed here and there which are poor but overall it is still an improvement albeit not massively so over the DVD.  The sound quality however is an improvement worth shouting about coming in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround sound although there are some weak audio spots at certain parts especially when it comes to dialogue.  The picture book is nice to behold and will please collectors and fans alike.  The special features are what really make this reissue worth shouting about as we have various directors like Friedkin, Scorcese and Spielberg talking about how Hitchcock influenced them and you even see spots in their movies where they borrowed from elements of Hitch's work.<br /><br />Overall, this is a worthy upgrade of the film more so for the great special feature documentaries than for the picture and sound quality which despite being still better in 1080p than the dvd release is not a great leap better in my opinion.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>Many people in my generation think that movie-history began with &quot;Back to the future&quot; and ended in &quot;Titanic&quot;. Don't get me wrong, I like both of them, but, really, cinema is way more than that. When I ask information about older movies to older people they seem to loose focus, their eyes become lost in the far horizon, and they say &quot;Yes, this is a great movie&quot;. But the problem is, they say that to EVERY old movie. I once tried to watch Casablanca; in fact, I watched the whole movie, but I didn't really like it. Casablanca is not an ageless movie, so I think it meant more to people who saw it when it was released than to me, watching it forty five years later. <p>With &quot;North by northwest&quot;, however, the situation was completely different. First of all, it is listed number 18 on imdb's top 250 films of all time. Second, I have watched the more famous Hitchcock movies, like &quot;Rear window&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, etc, and I find Hitchcock an amazing director. His techniques, his directing style, are very similar to what we see in movies today, to what I'm used to expect in a movie. And I think his films deal with subjects that don't seem to get old. <p>In &quot;North by northwest&quot;, Cary Grant is the man on the run for being mistaken for an agent he is not. During all the movie, he has to escape his nemesis, in famous and unforgettable scenes like the plane-man walking chase and the final pursuit on top of Mount Rushmore. When there is no action scene, there is the BEST dialogue I've ever seen on screen (very funny, fast and intelligent), between (mostly) Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the beautiful double-agent who falls in love with Grant. <p>This is really one of the most enterteining movies I've ever seen. I'm not going to say things like &quot;Nowadays, we don't have movies like that anymore&quot; because it's not true. People used to make good movies, and they're still making it today. You just have to have the capacity to know what is good from what is bad. <p>Great movie<br />Grade 9.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>"North by Northwest" is Alfred Hitchcock's followup to 1958's moody "Vertigo."  While it's not as "deep" as the latter film, "N by NW" is a first-rate action/mystery film that stands as one of the greatest films of all time.  The ever-suave Cary Grant and the striking Eva Marie Saint star in a movie that has all the elements we've come to expect from Hitch: mistaken identity, the intriguing blonde, murder, and deception.  And let's not forget the script, which is pregnant with witty one-liners and dodges cliches at all costs.  I wasn't around in 1959, but watching a movie like this in the theatre had to have been such an incredible experience.  You are literally hooked from the first frame.  The DVD itself is an attractive affair.  The picture is the best-looking I've ever seen in a Hitchcock movie.  In another review, I stated that "Vertigo" is the only film by Hitch available in 5.1 surround sound.  I was wrong!  "N by NW" is also in 5.1, and while the sound won't necessarily rock your system, it's a pretty decent soundtrack for a movie this old.  So, what are you waiting for?  I saw this on a friend's recommendation, and I'm kicking myself for not discovering it sooner.  "North by Northwest" is action filmmaking at its absolute peak and should not be missed.  I repeat: it's one of the greatest films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AV3JZAYAP7GHC.html">AV3JZAYAP7GHC</a><br/><p>This is probably in my top 3 for Hitchcock films for many reasons. The best that I can think if is that it is perhaps the best example of cinematic drama. For those not familiar with the plot, the story is a gripping mistaken-identity thriller: advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken as a government agent by the sinister Philip Vandamm (the ever-amazing James Mason). Vandamm is convinced Thornhill is after him, and tries to dispose of the strawman. Thornill eventually finds himself at the center of a complicated espionage plot which takes him across the country, ending with a spectacular climax atop the Mt. Rushmore.<br /><br />What makes this film nearly perfect for me is the way it's paced. It's a study in economy, since we're told very little at the beginning (parallel to Thornhill's ignorance), and more is revealed slowly over time. Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernst Lehman weave a carefully crafted tale, and Hitch's fluid direction is superb as Thornhill is placed in increasingly dangerous situations. Punctuating this danger is Bernard Hermann's tense and frightful score, and the blu-ray audio mix does it justice.<br /><br />The film may very well be Grant's best performance -- certainly his best in a Hitchcock film (his 3rd or 4th collaboration w/ Hitchcock, I believe.) He is his rakish, humorous self, but in N/NW he displays a certain physicality (Grant was a circus performer before becoming an actor) that makes him somewhat of an action hero. (Grant also has the greatest business suit of all time, which somehow survives all his encounters with little more than a dusty lapel.)<br /><br />I appreciated how well the film was transferred to blu-ray, with very rich colors, nice deep blacks and sharp images. Some flaws are to be expected since the film is over 50 years old. My only complaint is the cardboard keep-case -- I really wish studios would dispense with "fancy" cases and just put use good old plastic snap cases instead. The supplements seem fairly well rounded, but are in standard def. I'm looking forward to hearing the commentary by Lehmann, although I wish there were more commentary tracks available, perhaps from a learned critic such as Roger Ebert. (Ebert's commentary on "Citizen Kane", for instance, is excellent.)<br /><br />In all, this is an exceptional classic film that deserves to be in any collection, and now in a blu-ray format that doesn't disappoint.</p></br></body></html>

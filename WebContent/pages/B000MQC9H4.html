Double Check. Jack Black? WTF?  I love Jack Black, but he's seriously out of place here.  Even he doesn't appear to believe he's in the right place.<br /><br />Moreover, you could drive large Caterpillar trucks through the holes in Nancy Meyers' script.  Like how these two ladies actually swapped their houses despite Diaz's character happening upon the web site that very day.  Or, Winslet's character referring to some manual that Diaz's character put together covering the intense electronics in the house...despite the fact the Diaz's character left town in an unplanned state of frenzy.  Or Eli Wallach's character finally agreeing to be feted by his screenwriting peers, then suddenly having the very formal event held like one week later.  There's a long list of "doesn't work" things like that.<br /><br />Despite all that, what can I say - Cameron Diaz is a gifted physical comedienne in the classic Hollywood screwball blonde sort of way, I'd watch Kate Winslet in anything, and Jude Law always looks great on the screen...he's what a movie star ought to be.  And Nancy Meyers - my comments above aside - is someone worthy of respect with her hard work, creativity, vision and success in a male-dominated industry.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>What happens when two love scorned women, one in Los Angeles and the other in England, switch houses in an attempt to spend some time alone and away from men? Why they fall in love with the first man they meet upon arrival. What else would you expect? Yes, the plot is predictable and the premise overdone. And yes, this is most definitely a chick flick. But take heart you testosterone laden Neanderthals in the audience, Jack Black is one of the male love interests so you're safe to watch.<br /><br />`The Holiday' released in `06 is a light, good-hearted, romantic comedy boasting four popular stars involved in two separate romances on two continents, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law in England and Kate Winslet and Jack Black in Los Angeles. Both storylines are engaging and the chemistry is believable. My only complaint about the film is that more time was spent developing the romance in England and less on the Winslet/Black relationship in L.A. which happened to be my favorite part of the movie. Oh well, still a lot of fun and a great date film. The Los Angeles romance also includes a wonderful subplot with Eli Wallach which is a great addition to the storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>Well, actually anything with the incredibly talented Kate Winslet is worth watching.  The other stars in the movie were enjoyable.  My wife and I were somewhat split on this movie.  She thought the first half of the movie was a drag, while I thought the scenery and story were worthwhile.  The second half of the movie really took off.  I thought two pivotal plots helped make the movie very good.  The first was when Jack Black (always good) met and developed a relationship with Winslet's character.  The second was when we learned more about Jude Law's family.  The movie built a very strong momentum in the second half.  Had that been matched in the first half of the film, this would have been a 5 star flick.  As it is, this was an enjoyable film, with an intersting plot, made all the more enjoyable because of the movie's stars, especially Winslet and Black.  Four stars and recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>What happens when you are confused because you, or your partner, doesn't know if he/she loves you?

Meanwhile, in London, Iris is struggling with her affections for a co-worker. He has been toying with her for some three years. He acts as though he is interested in her one moment, but then has no qualms about openly seeing another woman. At one point, he is engaged to a woman--right in front of Iris. However often this happens, Iris just can't forget him. She loves him and wishes that he would unambiguously show love for her.<br /><br />The two hurt, confused women meet each other in the internet, and agree to live in each other's homes for two weeks in order to sort things out. Amanda goes to London, struggling in the snow of Christmastime. Iris goes to sunny California.<br /><br />Iris meets a man who diagnoses the situation facing Iris. He points out that it is natural to see a positive response from the other person as love and then to forget or deny the evidences of lack of love from that person.

Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, French Kiss, Bridget Jones' Diary, and The Whole Nine Yards are just a few of the more recent ones in this genre. THE HOLIDAY certainly falls headlong into this category, but does so with the addition of it taking place around the Christmas season. Writer/director/producer Nancy Meyers is very familiar in the RomCom arena. Her repertoire contains such gems as Private Benjamin and Father of the Bride (we'll forgivingly overlook the Father of the Bride II debacle for the moment).<br /><br />What The Holiday has going for it is some good dialogue and even better acting. Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black round out the prime roles. The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz, In Her Shoes) as she ejects her live-in boyfriend from her home. She's an intense young woman who's the CEO of her own upstart company that makes movie trailers. Her lifestyle is getting the better of her and she decides she needs a holiday.<br /><br />Iris (Kate Winslet, Finding Neverland) is in love with one of her close working colleagues and decides she needs a mental health getaway from the constrained English countryside. But what to do. Ah! House swap!<br /><br />Iris and Amanda fly across the Atlantic and take over each other's residences. Iris lands in L.A. to find a beautifully manicured house with every possible accouterment, while Amanda drags herself up the snow-laden driveway to a cramped but quaint English cottage. Initially Amanda hates what she finds. The quiet life doesn't suit her. But then she runs into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law, Closer) and a one-night stand turns into something Amanda never thought possible. Iris, in L.A., struggles with falling out of love with her ex-beau who is soon to be married but won't stop bothering her (he calls, sends emails, etc.). But Iris develops a unique friendship with Miles (Jack Black), a sound mixer for films, and she sees in him the same failings her own relationships have.<br /><br />Although very predictable, the powerhouse actors and actresses with the superb dialogue made this flick enjoyable. The handsome Jude Law will make young viewers swoon and the sexy Cameron Diaz will appeal to men who still have an inkling of testosterone flowing through their veins.<br /><br />Jack Black has toned down his hyperactivity and settled into a fine role (although some may miss his outlandish behaviors of ol'). His "breast graze" lines are funny and poignant, making us love him for his calmly delivered antics this time.<br /><br />Kate Winslet sheds her Titanic persona and goes back to what she knows: being a regular English actress. Her simple demeanor was quite well pulled off for someone who tends to have a more haughty acting history, showing that she can ugly down a bit and act in ways we may have forgotten.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a pretty predictable romantic comedy but the script is so strong and the acting so well done that it deserves plenty of accolades.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>I dreamed about writer-director  Nancy Myers' THE HOLIDAY last night.  It is a honey of a romantic comedy, something out of Hollywood's golden age.  No one smokes, witty dialogue substitutes for swearing, love scenes are passionate kisses, and violence is slapstick comedy.  Myers loves old Hollywood; with her ex-husband, Charles Shyer, she made the successful remakes of THE PARENT TRAP and FATHER OF THE BRIDE and its sequel.  By herself she wrote and directed the romantic and funny WHAT WOMEN WANT and SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.<br /><br />What a wonderful cast Myers has for THE HOLIDAY, which is about "house swapping" at Christmas time.  Kate Winslet (Iris) is a London journalist who lives in a storybook cottage south of London.  She finds that the man she loves is about to get married to someone else.  Cameron Diaz (Amanda) lives in a Beverly Hills mansion, designs movie trailers, and has just kicked out an unfaithful live-in boyfriend.  The two women "meet cute" on the Internet, Amanda answering Iris' ad for someone to swap houses for Christmas season.  It is perfect for both, as it always is in movies of this type and never is in real life--Iris is lonely in her cottage, while Amanda craves someplace small and quiet.  Diaz and Winslet are both wonderful.  Myers' lovely script makes them come alive as actresses with witty dialogue and romantic situations at holiday time.<br /><br />Soon Amanda finds Jude Law (Iris' brother Graham) on her English cottage doorstep and, of course, falls in love with him almost instantly, especially when she learns he is a widower with two small children.  And Iris has two very different men pop up in her life in Los Angeles:  Jack Black (KING KONG) as a film composer named Winston, and Eli Wallach (in his best role in decades) as a 90 year old retired screenwriter.  All of the performances are superb, miracle of miracles no one smokes or swears (thank you, Nancy), and Myers (and her designers) do magical things to contrast Los Angeles and rural England at Christmas season.<br /><br />The ending is Hollywood fairy tale romance that you can see coming from the film's mid-point on, but it still makes you feel in love with life and movies out of a bygone era.  The only flaws are a Hans Zimmer score so obtrusive that I had to turn on the English subtitles on my DVD player to get the dialogue, and the movie runs a bit too long at 136 minutes.  Otherwise, THE HOLIDAY is pure cinematic magic with five wonderful actors in peak form.  I can't wait to see what the incomparably talented Nancy Myers does next.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>After about 45 minutes of overdone laborious set-up, at least half of this overlong, dual-track 2006 romantic comedy takes flight, while the other half remains stubbornly contrived. More problems persist when three of the four principals show an affinity for screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers' brand of breezy but manipulative farce, while the fourth seems like he doesn't belong in the movie at all. A calculated throwback to golden-era Hollywood in more ways than one, the stacked-deck premise is simple enough - two women, Amanda in LA and Iris in England, both unlucky in love, decide impulsively to switch houses during the Christmas holiday with the intent of celebrating their emancipation from men bad for them.<br /><br />Amanda's side of the story is the more pleasurable of the two because ironically, it doesn't veer too much from formula. At first, Cameron Diaz's performance as type-A movie trailer producer Amanda seems heavily exaggerated, but once she meets Jude Law, very Grant-like (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) as Iris' smooth-talking brother Graham, she settles down as he is the epitome of the Sensitive Man for reasons that become clear soon enough. Probably because the actors are such striking people, their chemistry is palpable and unforced, as their characters pretend not to fall in love when it is obvious they are. Iris' LA adventure does not fare as well. Although Kate Winslet is dependably winning as Iris, her natural vibrancy and beauty seem at odds with her role as a doormat to an ex-boyfriend who keeps stringing her along.<br /><br />The stateside romance is also more convoluted as it involves her almost-instant friendship with an aged Hollywood screenwriter who refuses to be the subject of an industry tribute. It's nice to see 91-year old Eli Wallach play the curmudgeonly writer with old-world charm and a wry sense of humor, but the subplot feels forced as an excuse to provide a more direct connection to the Hollywood film classics. Even worse, Jack Black is completely out of his element as Miles, a sardonic film composer already in a shaky relationship with an actress. That Iris and Miles get together seems more like an afterthought since there is zero chemistry between Winslet and Black. The resulting imbalance between the two storylines adds to the interminable feel of the movie's 136-minute running time.<br /><br />Even though there are a handful of funny sight gags (mostly spotlighting Diaz) and a clever three-way phone conversation with Iris at the center, the film is burdened by its leisurely pacing and Meyers' indulgent approach to the material. Thanks to Jon Hutman's picture-postcard sets, especially of the English countryside, and Hans Zimmer's appropriately romantic score, it certainly feels like the Hollywood confection that she was trying to replicate. The 2007 DVD has a robust commentary track courtesy of Meyers and several of her crew like Zimmer, Hutman and editor Joe Hutshing but featuring none of the stars. There is also an eighteen-minute making-of featurette, pretty standard, along with a number of previews for current and upcoming theatrical releases like "Spider-Man 3".</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>The Holiday (2006)<br /><br />Right after seeing a rather peculiar Kate Winslet interpretation of Tula, the adulterous woman in a "Romance & Cigarettes" relationship, Ms. Winslet comes back in her lovable self as Iris, a London based journalist who loves a man who gets engaged with one of her co-workers, and broken hearted she agrees to exchange homes with Amanda, beautifully played by Cameron Diaz, an entrepreneur who is so stressed out that she looks for an opportunity to go on vacation and change her reality, agreeing to move to London during her Christmas vacation.<br /><br />This movie is fun, romantic, with enough heartache to get us so involved that we had a wonderful experience while watching it.<br /><br />These two rather unhappy women exchange messages through the Internet and give each other an opportunity to escape sad circumstances that have them both stressed and tired of life.<br /><br />The settings of the cottage owned by Iris are picturesque, intimate and cozy, allowing Amanda to feel part of the world that surrounds her and find an extremely attractive man, the brother of Iris, played by Jude Law who makes her forget that when it comes to relationships: "She is not good at it."<br /><br />Iris on the other hand, travels to Los Angeles and finds that Amanda owns a mansion in Beverly Hills that affords her all the luxury, space, and privacy required to get over the awful and co-dependent relationship she has with her co-worker, played by Rufus Sewell.<br /><br />Iris meets Miles, played by Jack Black, and the two strike a relationship that transforms both into individuals that are finally set free from relationships that do not recognize their self-worth.<br /><br />This movie is a MUST see... delightful, with great scenes and an ability to delve into issues in an endearing, fun and educational manner.

Two lonely and disappointed women will make a decisive twist of fate to their lives betting for a travel from U.K. to L.A. in order to make a sudden and decisive change of their affective lives.<br /><br />Until this point everything seems extremely predictable but the touch of originality given by her talented director, letting a secondary personage breaths and gives the story a persuasive "lesson of dignity". Arthur Abbot (Eli Wallach) is an old and "out of the game" script writer whose wise advises to our very young English girl (Kate Winslet) fits admirably. Plus, the presence of the charismatic Joe Black gives this film laughable freshness. On the other hand Cameron Diaz gives one of her prominent roles in years proving she is much more comedian instead dramatic actress, and the presence of Jude Law as a consecrated and full time devoted father, whose recent affective loss will not avoid he seduces this American girl, who really thinks she has dealt will all kind of situations.<br />At the end, a charming resolution will conclude with a soft smile in our minds and hearts.<br /><br />A summer breeze and romantic film free of violence and special effects (which by itself it sounds incredible at these times don't you?)</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Finally an intelligent romantic comedy that's lovely and charming with a great cast.

(Cameron Diaz) and Iris in Surrey (Kate Winslet) are both having man problems: Amanda's just broken up with her cheating boyfriend, and Iris's sort-of ex has just gotten engaged. They both decide a vacation is in order, and with the help of a house-swapping website, trade houses for two weeks.<br /><br />The "comedy" part of "romantic comedy" comes in when the two women have to adjust to different lifestyles. I've never been to either England or California, but it rang pretty true to me, and didn't seem too exaggerated. The jet lag was definitely a realistic factor.<br /><br />Amanda's first night at Iris's cottage, there's a knock at the door and she opens it to a very drunk, very good-looking man who turns out to be Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law). She decides a one-night stand with a perfect stranger would be a great way to get over her ex. Graham's drunk, but he's not an idiot, so he obliges. They're both a little more affected than they expected, and they reluctantly start a romance they know has no future.<br /><br />Iris, meanwhile, answers the door to a couple: Miles (Jack Black), who's a friend of Amanda's ex, and his girlfriend. Iris and Miles get a romance, too, but it moves much more slowly, and is much more complicated. Iris's ex, Jasper, doesn't want to let her go despite the fact that he's marrying another woman--he calls and sends his manuscript for her to proofread, and tells her he can't do without her. The distance is helping, but keeping busy is better, and Iris manages that when she befriends one of Amanda's neighbors, an elderly screenwriter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, more time was spent on Hollywood's idea of the prettier couple--Diaz and Law--despite the fact that their story was less complex. On the plus side, the movie was over two hours long (138 minutes), so neither story felt too rushed.<br /><br />Iris and Miles's romance was more believable. They were both dealing with similar break-up issues, and because of the slower pace of their relationship, it was easier to see them becoming drawn to each other and appreciating each other's strengths. Iris's issues were extremely familiar, so that likely had something to do with why I was more drawn to her story.<br /><br />Amanda and Graham's romance seemed to be more simple chemistry, and while both characters were likable and were dealing with issues that were solved by the relationship (Amanda keeps relationships on the surface, and Graham's got some emotional trauma and responsibility), it wasn't really clear that each was the specific person the other needed in their life.<br /><br />I do have to say I appreciated the ending. Without spoiling it, I'll say that it was satisfying and hopeful without being too unbelievable.<br /><br />If I tried, no doubt I could come up with a dozen or more quibbles, but it was such a cheerful movie that I'd rather not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Nancy Meyers' "The Holiday" has been seriously dissed by most of America's film critics--including one who suggested that any man who goes to see it should be forced to pay with a crucial part of his anatomy instead of money. "The Holiday" is indeed a prime example of what is condecendingly known as a "chick flick," and it's not a movie you can make great claims for. But "The Holiday" succeeds outstandingly in living up to its title; it provides an audience with a two-hour vacation filled with charming, likable actors playing charming, likable characters. The movie is set during the Christmas holidays in which two women with man problems--Iris (Kate Winslet), an English journalist, and Amanda (Cameron Diaz), an L.A. producer of film trailers--meet over the Internet. On a whim, they decide to switch houses for Christmas; Amanda ends up in Iris's picture-postcard-pretty cottage in Surrey, Iris in Amanda's luxurious, gated mansion in Beverly Hills. There, they discover new romantic complications: Amanda with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris with a film composer named Miles (Jack Black). There's also a subplot about the friendship that develops between Iris and an elderly screenwriter played by the venerable Eli Wallach. Nothing that happens in the movie is at all original or consequential. I could even quibble about an inaccuracy or two in Meyers' screenplay (Cary Grant was from Bristol in Gloucestershire, not Surrey). But seeing "The Holiday" makes you feel happy and light of heart, which is all it sets out to do. While the film's appeal is necessarily greater for women, I also think most men will find this a more-than-serviceable date movie. Sometimes you want a movie that's rich, gooey and sweet, that contains no sharp edges and requires no sharp utensils for its consumption. In an increasingly abrasive world, the need for cinematic confections is greater than ever, and "The Holiday" fills that bill.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>I don't think this decade has had much success with romantic comedies, but trust me that with "The Holiday", the 2000s have never looked better. I consider this film to be one that extracts the finest performances from Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz EVER, and once you see it, you will know what I mean.<br /><br />Kate Winslet has acted in many good movies ("Hideous Kinky", "Holy Smoke", "Iris") but its ironic that her most poignant and well-written role comes in "The Holiday". You probably know the story already - its about two women on two different continents who swap houses and lives after a chance meeting on the Internet - but the treatment and above all, the DIALOGUE, is what drives this romantic comedy to the heights of that most rare animal - a cinema classic.<br /><br />And thats what "The Holiday" is. I honestly think that a genuine, feel-good film such as this should be embraced by the Oscar group, instead of their focus on typical epic films such as "Babel" and "Gladiator". This is where the magic is. Cameron Diaz especially, has never found a better vehicle for her goofy charm (yes, this is even better - staggeringly better than "There's Something About Mary"). Jude Law, who has had his share of incredible dramatic performances in films such as "Wilde" and "Alfie", uses his effortless charm and natural screen presence to radiate such magnetism, that he is undeniably the most spot-on best romantic lead you would have seen for a while.<br /><br />Audiences I saw this with claimed that "The Holiday" was at least twice as better than "Pretty Woman". No comparison. The films I consider really good romantic comedies would be "Never Been Kissed", "A Life Less Ordinary" and "Theres Something About Mary". However, "The Holiday" is all that, but the amazing thing is that it has a heart of gold and does NOT rely upon slapstick humor to make the dialogue and situations work.<br /><br />Kate Winslets' character in fact, is one worth coming back to and studying, even from a film students' perspective. She infuses her role with so much wit and warmth, that we do not mind if this girl even ends up single in the movie - we just want her to find herself. The scene where she dumps her boyfriend after three years of emotional abuse is absolutely wondrous - the actress glows and gives off such electric spark that its impossible not to FEEL for this beautiful character.<br /><br />Jack Black, in a superb cinematic role as a Hollywood music industry biggie, is never meant to be taken seriously as a love interest for Kate, much as some would like to think so. Their sad tale is of two people in two different bad relationships finding a friend again - I loved how the end of this movie did not strive to hurriedly bring two people together - rather, it allows space for the characters to breathe and live their emotions, which is why its so easy to take this film seriously, and which is why you MUST watch it.<br /><br />Finally a film worth buying! I have waited so long for a movie of such depth, grace and respect for the art of film-making.<br /><br />There are so many amazing scenes here - Kate in her quaint cottage trying to commit suicide (a poignant moment filled with humor and grief all at the same time), Kate waking up in the lap of luxury in Los Angeles, the initial meeting between Cameron and Jude and their wondrous chemistry, the moment where they realize they are in love with each other, the moment where Cameron meets Jude's kids, and her ultimate realization that her selfish, unloving persona has been undone by this mans' love - and the scene where she leaves it all behind to run back to the person she loves the most. There are SO many such moments during this movie. Consider this a return to form for Hollywood in general.<br /><br />I would especially like to thank the makers of "The Holiday". I don't know if any of them read Amazon reviews, but as a critic of film, I find it so hard to like so many of the "serious" films out there today. Most of them are made to win Oscars, and then there are those tailormade to win Academy Awards. Either way, they're made to win something. And then you have the disposable comedies of the "Scary Movie" variety. But a film such as this makes me realize that the glory days of the 1950s and 60s of Hollywood still exist.<br /><br />I must also state here that I only saw this film because I saw that it starred Kate Winslet. This is one actress that has never let me down throughout her amazing career - and to find that she gave her best ever performance in this film made me all the more happier. She takes a beaten down, funnily written character and transforms her into a woman of great intelligence and feeling - this is NOT Bridget Jones' Diary!<br /><br />Which is why its obvious why these stars signed up for a movie such as this. On the face of it, "The Holiday" is a two-story arc that converges into one in the end - about the love lives of two very different women. But it is so much more than that - in fact, it is a meditation on love and hope in this day and age.<br /><br />If my praise seems extravagant, all I can say is, buy this. Do not rent it, buy it. It is the pinnacle of working excellence for all three major stars - Jude, Kate and Cameron, and it is by far the best romantic comedy of the 2000s by a long shot. Also, I find it hard to believe that anything more amazing than this would be released anytime this year.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. Five Stars. Hollywood finally redeems itself and gets it right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"The Holiday" is a cute, romantic movie about two women, Amanda and Iris (Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet), who both find themselves royally screwed over by the men in their lives. Amanda and Iris connect via a housing-swap Web site and agree to switch houses for two weeks in order to escape during the holidays. Amanda heads to England, where she is immediately swept off her feet by Iris's charming brother, Graham (Jude Law). Meanwhile, Iris arrives in L.A. and is blown away by Amanda's posh lifestyle. She befriends an elderly neighbor (Eli Wallach) who is a retired Hollywood screenwriter, and ultimately finds an unexpected new love interest in Miles (Jack Black), a film composer.<br /><br />This is a fun little movie. I enjoyed the Amanda/Graham scenes most of all. Diaz and Law have excellent chemistry and make a great on-screen pair. I am a huge fan on Winslet and she did a great job in the film as well, but the scenes with her really dragged on a bit in the beginning. There were too many scenes where Iris was just sitting around lamenting about her cad of an ex-boyfriend. My other major beef with this film is that I do not understand why Jack Black is in it. Was no one else available? I have no problem with Black, but this just isn't his type of role, and there was absolutely no romantic spark of any kind between him and Winslet.<br /><br />In spite of its few flaws, I still enjoyed "The Holiday" very much.

The Jude Law character was one of the more believable characters I have seen in a long time. The film is long on Law and Diaz and short on Black and Winslet.  Also the last several films I have seen with Eli Wallach he plays a jew, when the character could have been anyone, but he makes these characters jewish -- that really isn't necessary and he seems to be turning into a professional jew..  The conversations -- especially at the beginning-- between Diaz and Law is some of the best written dialog I have heard in a long time.  The film rocks along switching between LA and England and comes to a happy if implausible end.  How these characters are going to resolve their geographical problems is left hanging in all of the happiness.<br /><br />This film is essentially sex driven and deals entirely with adult love issues, so it really isn't a family film.  The best part is there are no car chases, no explosions, no significant profanity, and there is even some character development with a (thin) plot -- all unusual characteristics in current films.  A fun film and worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>I could identify with these people trying to work out their problems. The acting was good as was the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>The movie was enjoyable enough but I felt it lacked that romantic "spark" between the two couples featured in the film. The basic premise: Two women decide to trade homes, both of them looking to escape from recent boyfriend troubles. One comes to America, one goes to the English countryside and (you could predict this, right?), they encounter new guys, with new potentials.<br /><br />  Everyone's acting is up to snuff but the film still came across as mildly entertaining and certainly not on my "Top Ten" list of romantic comedies.<br /><br />  However, there were some special moments that stood out, including:<br /><br />1. The always watchable Jack Black, with his irreverent wit, playing against type as a pretty decent guy in this film. He can't completely hold in his wild nature, but he is relatively restrained.<br /><br />2. Eli Wallach. He's a legend and every move of his is thought out.<br /><br />3. The bonus features, including comments from the crew and cast about making the movie. Kate Winslet admits her fears about trying to be fun, the director talks about the process of making this film, etc. The commentary lends insight into the whole creative enterprise, from start to finish, and would be interesting for budding film enthusiasts to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>I'm sorry but this movie is just so cheesy ,people do not act like this. Your not going to have a hi powered movie executive switch places with a frumpy poor girl. Jack Black is just a horrid actor, why do we have to spend one more second looking at his dumb face. Listening to him doing the humming,duba dooodle dooo doooo, made me want run from from my living room, and jump off the nearest bridge. Not to mention that the trailer guy in the movie was really getting old after the fourth or fifth time. Stay away from this if you demand good movies,this is just gloopy yeck.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"The Holiday" put a smile on my face.  It is a heartwarming romantic film that winds up being a blast of good cheer for the holidays.  Director Nancy Meyers has one Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304696558">Private Benjamin (Full Screen Edition)</a> and did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVZA8">Something's Gotta Give</a> with Diane Keaton & Jack Nicholson and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXQS">What Women Want</a> with Helen Hunt & Mel Gibson.  She hits the right chords in this romantic genre again.<br /><br />Kate Winslet who was once nominated for a picture titled "Iris" plays the character Iris.  Winslet is an interesting actress who has been nominated for 27 various film awards including 5 Oscars and has only won two smaller awards as Best Supporting Actress for "Iris" by the L.A. Film Critics and for "Sense & Sensibility" by the Screen Actors Guild.  While I think my favorite film performance of hers was in "Finding Neverland," I found it interesting in the DVD extras her comments on how pleased she was to try comedy.  The scene with the split phone call where she has Diaz and Law on the other ends & keeps connecting with the wrong one is hilarious.  She does a charming job throughout the film.<br /><br />Jack Black plays "Miles."  I think I will always think of him as the guy who Bruce Willis blows his arm off in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226888">The Jackal - Collector's Edition</a>.  Seeing him as an offbeat romantic lead was not as great a thrill as seeing him spurt blood and run mindlessly around a meadow.  But hopefully even guys who don't look like Jude Law will be inspired to one day find their true love.  As a film music composer, Black was most interesting in Blockbuster where he knew the scores to random movies.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz has a smile that is as wide as the state of North Carolina.  From her films like "There's Something About Mary," "Being John Malkovich," "Vanilla Sky" & "Gangs of New York," she's shown her ability to fit in a wide number of film genres.  She captures our attention as Amanda who heads off to England after breaking up with Ed Burns' character.<br /><br />Jude Law is impressive as an actor.  He fits into the romantic comedy genre effortlessly as Graham who is a young widowed father with two small children.  The girls who play his kids Sophie and Olivia are darling.  I'm not sure if he clicks as deeply as he did as Inman with Nicole Kidman in "Cold Mountain," but we feel a connection and hope the lovers get together.  (One recent high school graduate who watched the film with me commented that Jude Law & Johnny Depp are God's gift to women.  ...I smiled...)<br /><br />Eli Wallach who was over 90 years old when this was filmed plays Arthur, a screenwriter who Iris connects with while on holiday.  Rufus Sewell from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMH8">Helen of Troy</a> plays Jasper who breaks Iris' heart & tries to keep her on a string.<br /><br />I found it interesting that all of these characters worked for the media from a film trailer editor to a music score composer to a screenwriter to a book editor to a newspaper writer.  While we might have had a variety of occupations like a plumber, a piano tuner or a construction contractor, the similarity of occupation was not a major distraction.<br /><br />I found the interplay between Los Angeles & England to be a delight.  A good love story may not differ that much in its essentials from story to story, but this one is done with great style & lifted my spirits.  I hope it does your too.  Cheers!</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Excited as I was to see `The Holiday' I was very skeptical.  I had heard some horrible things about this movie from some of the critics, and while I generally avoid anything the critics have to say, when the critics say something bad about Kate Winslet (an actress who NEVER gets a bad review) then I get a little scared.  As the credits began to roll though I realized that critics are seldom ever right and if it stars Kate Winslet it can't be bad...I mean really, when has she ever gone awry?<br /><br />`The Holiday' ends up unfolding as a double feature, and for the most part it's split right down the middle, the first half dealing heavily between Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Graham (Jude Law) and the second half dealing more with Iris (Kate Winslet) and Miles (Jack Black) and this works well beings that for the first half Kate comes off somewhat dull and Jack is all but nonexistent, and right about the time of the movie that you start losing interest in Cameron, Kate steps up her game and Jack appears in almost every frame...it really does work well.<br /><br />So the story follows Iris and Amanda as they, sick and tired of their lives at the moment, decide to trade homes, cars and lives for the Christmas holiday in an attempt to escape the stress and find themselves.  Iris has been pining for her co-worker and ex-boyfriend Jasper (Rufus Sewell) for three long years only to have him get engaged to another co-worker without having the decency to let Iris know.  Amanda has become all but detached from her cheating boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) and has lost herself in her work.  Both Iris and Amanda realize they really, truly NEED a vacation.<br /><br />So, after meeting online Iris heads to LA and Amanda to London and it's there that their lives are soon forever changed.  Like I said, the first half of this movie BELONGS to Cameron and Jude, especially Jude who in actuality owned this whole movie proving that he is such a talented actor.  Kate and Jack quickly become background characters as Amanda and Graham (Iris's brother) begin their passionate affair.  Right about the time that they encounter the same trouble most couple endure Iris and Miles begin to get closer and closer and take over the film, becoming the focus of the second act sort-of-speak.<br /><br />Nancy Meyers, who also wrote and directed `Something's Gotta Give', proves that she is capable of making a sweet comedy that grabs you and makes you smile.  Cameron is delightful here, and her redition of the crying fits that made Diane's character so wonderful in `Something's Gotta Give' is priceless.  Kate, shines bright in the second half, and her meandering in the beginning of the film I blame solely on the script that kept her strapped until she was needed.  Jude Law is utterly fantastic, and as I mentioned, the best performance here and Jack Black is funny and witty, and while he may have been a bit miscast he wasn't as dreadful as he could have been.  Let's just say that by the time he's on the screen Kate has picked up so much slack he could have drooled in a corner and he would have been fine.<br /><br />So, `The Holiday' may be just what you need this holiday, something sweet, funny and smart...something you'll remember as a delightful experience and one I'm sure you'll revisit.  I will say that there is one scene in particular that almost made me cry, the scene where Iris, after befriending screenwriter Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), is in the company of an Oscar...I mean how cruel to have one of our greatest actresses (in my humble opinion Kate is our finest working actress today) in the presence of an Oscar when she herself has been SNUBBED four times (I still can't believe she's been nominated for four brilliant performances and hasn't won one of them)...I mean, I was almost in tears it was so depressing!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>This is an interesting movie about four people falling in love at Christmas.<br /><br />Iris played by Kate Winslet is in love with Jasper who works at the same newspaper she does. They had been involved with each other and Iris still holds out hope that they will get back together. That is until she finds out that Jasper is engaged to be married to the woman that he cheated on her with. This leads her to be depressed. She wants to get away and list her house on a home exchange.<br /><br />Amanda who is a L.A. Movie trailer designer just broke up with her live in boyfriend and also wants to get away. She sees Iris' ad and they decide to switch houses for two weeks during the holidays.<br /><br />Iris loves L.A. and Amanda's house. During the time that she spends there she meets Arthur (played by Eli Wallach) an old Hollywood Producer and they become close as he tells her things about old Hollywood and she helps him regain some mobility so he can walk up the stairs at a reception in his honor. She also meets Miles (Jack Black) who is a composer who worked with Amanda's ex. As they spend time together they realize that there is a spark between them.<br /><br />Amanda does not like England so much at first. She is cold and board and shortly after she gets there she buys a return flight home. Then she meets Iris' brother Graham played by Jude Law. They end up having sex and after spending time together Amanda realizes that she is falling in love with him.<br /><br />A very good-feel good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is a Hollywood producer who's just gotten her heart broken; Iris Simkins (Kate Winslet) lives in England and is also at the losing end of a romance.  Both ladies are miserable and decide to get away from home for Christmas.  They find each other on an online house-switch site and before you can say "I know how this is going to end!" Amanda is living in a cozy English cottage and Iris is ensconced in a luxurious LA mansion.  And you'll never guess what happens next.  (Okay, you will guess - in about half a minute.)<br /><br />Diaz, Winslet, and co-stars Jude Law and Jack Black are all fine here, looking beautiful and clever and giving sincere performances.  It's not their fault that the script is so predictable and corny with no room for WHY these new loves blossom so quickly, so blissfully, and so conveniently, considering the women are emotionally wounded and would need some time to heal and the men are not looking for relationships.  And what exactly are the odds of meeting your dream mate within hours of moving to a foreign country?  Eli Wallach gives a winning performance as a doddering old scriptwriter befriended by Iris, but again, it's all too perfect; there's no question that they will become instant buddies and that their lives will both be enriched by their friendship.<br /><br />If I were a woman in the 18-26 target group, I'd probably love this movie and even shed a few tears at it; as it is, I just kept thinking, "Well, there's five hours of my life I'll never get back."  (What?  It's only 136 minutes?  Impossible!  I thought it would never end.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>You HAVE to see this movie! This is one of those movies that when you are done watching it, you just feel good! I was pleasantly surprised at how great it was! And, what a neat concept - Home Exchange!?!</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film, much less laugh or be moved to an occasional tear. Honestly, Jack Black's face on the cover screamed: "Not in a million years!" Seriously, Jack Black, romantic comedy? Seriously, Jack Black - seriously? Well, there are four stars at the top of this review, so did Jack work? No, he didn't. I have a feeling that the filmmakers were aware of this as well because his screen time was ? that of his other co-stars.<br /><br />Yet, this is a four-star review. So what worked?<br /><br />This is a difficult movie to compartmentalize. Per the story line, it should be split equally into two parts. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a movie-trailer producer who lives in LA and has broken up with her boyfriend. She's looking for an escape. Iris (Kate Winslet) is in love with someone she works with, yet he has just become engaged, much to her unfortunate surprise. She, as well, needs an escape and lists her cozy Surrey fairy-tale-like cottage on a home-exchange board. Amanda sees it, is intrigued, and they agree to an immediate swap. The very next day, in fact. This seems a bit pushed, considering the time difference between California and England, and the suddenness, especially on Amanda's part, but it's easily set aside.<br /><br />One would think that we have two stories. Yet we don't - at least, not in screen time. Granted, the movie is long (2:15), but it isn't until one hour and eleven minutes that anything of consequence happens for Iris in L.A. Prior to that, quite a bit has been going on in Surrey. Very oddly disjointed.<br /><br />Amanda is disturbed in the middle of the night (which for her would be dinnertime) by a loud pounding on the fairy-tale-cottage's door. It's Iris's brother, Graham, in what can only be called a spot-on Jude Law performance. Because of the quick swap, many things were forgotten, such as Iris's brother who often comes over to sleep off a good drunk if he spends too much time at the pub, and that Amanda has a boyfriend who will be sending people (Jack Black and his girlfriend) over to pick up his stuff.<br /><br />I'll sum it up: stuff happens between Amanda and Graham. Graham isn't quite the man he seems, and for once in the movies that's a good thing! There's a scene when Amanda surprisingly visits Graham at his house and they spend time in a, well, tent, that screams of the magic of Finding Neverland. Amanda and Graham have something together, and it's obvious to everyone. It must have been obvious to the filmmakers, because they seemed to grab a bit more than 2/3 of the total screen time.<br /><br />When we flip back to Iris in LA, it feels jolting, but Iris is growing as well. Iris, we know from observation, cries frequently. Amanda, we know from being told, hasn't cried since she was fifteen. There's some irony in that they have swapped houses. Perhaps the affect of Iris's presence will loosen up Amanda; perhaps Amanda will have a cooling influence on Iris.<br /><br />Sadly, only one of these plays through.<br /><br />Iris develops two special relationships in L.A. One is with a ninety-year old writer of many Hollywood screenplays. The other is with Miles (Jack Black). Guess which is more moving and believable?<br /><br />With Kate Winslet in the movie, it seems impossible to say this, but I will: if only she hadn't been in it. The filmmakers (I'm using this generally - who knows whose decision it was) chose to relegate her to a supporting role, when she should have shared the leading female role with Cameron Diaz (odd that her ninety-year-old friend, Arthur played well by Eli Wallach says nearly the same thing to her). Iris's L.A. story line could have been more believable, and it could have involved someone other than Jack Black. Let's keep him in Nacho Libre roles forever. He didn't belong here.<br /><br />But oh, how touching and moving it was when the film swept back to Surrey, to Amanda and Graham. This was their film. Both characters saw real, concrete and believable growth. For everything they brought to this film, it gets four stars from me - someone who was sure they would dislike the film going in.<br /><br />(Regarding the title of the review: I'm a guy.)</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>The Holiday is this season's romance comedy.  No doubt, the main premise of the film involves the ups and downs of being in relationships.  Kate Winslet (Iris Simpkins) and Cameron Diaz (Amanda Woods) star in the movie along with Jude Law (Graham) and Jack Black (Miles).  The film has two major storylines, but the majority of the film intermingles Iris and Amanda's personal predicaments, that emphasize the meaning of friendship and the pleasure of being in the presence of great company.<br /><br />The film runs a little over two hours with much detail.  The movie takes viewers on a transcontinental trip that crosses from the picturesque and almost Thomas Kinkade-like wintry English village scene where Iris resides to Amanda's posh Beverly Hills surroundings.  The women decide to exchange living quarters in order to heal from dysfunctional relationships.  But the comic relief comes from Amanda's character who never seems to escape from her job as a movie trailer producer because throughout her uncompromising situations, she worries too much and her worries play out like movie trailers.  The only odd part of the film involves the storyline, which involves Iris befriending retired screenwriter, Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach).  Nevertheless, the surprising and touching part of the film comes at the end with Jude Law's character.<br /><br />The Holiday is one of those films to sit back and relax to.  There are a lot of laughs as well as tugging at the heartstrings.  If you enjoyed Love Actually or Bridget Jones's Diary, and films that add a little seasonal atmosphere, you may like The Holiday.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Holiday is a cute and yet predictable film about two women who will do anything and go anywhere to get over their recent heartbreaks. Winslet's character is a hopeless romantic, her boyfriend gets engaged to another woman and decides to swap her house for two weeks with a lonesome American, Cameron Diaz does a wonderful job, she keeps getting better and better with each film. Amanda (Diaz) has discovered her boyfriend has been cheating on her with his receptionist, he blames Amanda saying she pushed him away and that's why he strayed. Deciding to start anew, Amanda and Iris (Winslet) change their scenery and lives. With that being said, eventually both ladies find love again, I won't spoil the rest but The Holiday isn't a perfect film but it's darn close. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>My Oppinion: The Holiday is a very funny movie, i loved all the characters and the actors were great.<br /><br />About the film: The Holiday is about two women irs(Winslet) & Amanda(Diaz) who are fed up with thier love life. They switch homes for the holiday on a home swapping web site. Iris lives in london and Amanda lives in la. The two swap homes for the Holiday and end up meeting the guys of thier dreams which one Grham(Law) is iris's brother and Miles(Black) is Amanda's ex-boyfriends best friend. which takes a comical turn on how the girls keep the guys.<br /><br />My second Oppinion: The Holiday is a great Romantic comedy for everyone. Nancy Meyers does an outstanding job on this movie.<br /><br />If you liked this movie then check out The Holiday original Motion Picture Soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Three things I think after having watched, "The Holiday."  The first is that Eli Wallach stole this romantic comedy.  He plays Arthur Abbott, who in his younger days was an Oscar winning screenwriter and who is now a neighbor of Iris (Kate Winslet) now that the young English woman is living in the Hollywood mansion of Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who is now living in the little English cottage of Iris in Surrey.  The two women have swapped homes this particular Christmas because Iris has discovered her ex-boyfriend is getting married and Amanda just needs to get away from her job making movie trailers.  Since it is a romantic comedy both of the women meet men, with Amanda running into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law), and Iris meeting Miles (Jack Black), a composer.  The problem is that the most interesting and endearing relationship in the film is between Iris and Arthur.  Jack Black is trying to play things straight here, something he had proven he can do already in "Shallow Hall" (when he discovers why Cadence is in the hospital), but he is totally wasted in this movie, even if Wallach is not stealing every scene he is in without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />The second thing I am thinking is that there is a reason why Kate Winslet is the youngest actress to have earned five Oscar nominations for her work.  I am not saying that this performance is worth of a nomination, but every time we had a scene of Cameron Diaz working so hard to act it was refreshing to get back to Winslet showing how it should be done.  Again, the sparks between her and Wallach are the highpoint of this film.  The third thing on my list is that they did not take advantage of the running gag of Amanda picturing a trailer of her sad and pathetic love life in her own mind.  Actually, all we usually get to hear is the familiar voice of Hal Douglas narrating the trailer, but I think there was a whole lot more mileage to get out of the idea (e.g., showing the same scenes but giving them totally different spins by changing the music and the voiceovers).<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly in terms of my ultimate evaluation of this film, I think that this film lacks a key requirement of most romances, which is the grand gesture.  Actually, it needs two grand gestures given that there are two romances trying to flower here.  Now the label of grand gesture is somewhat hyperbolic, because sometimes the boy can get the girl at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141741">"hello"</a> or not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCI">say anything</a> and just stand with a boom box playing the right song.  But I think there should be something both unique and significant that somebody does to get the person they love.  Think of your favorite romantic comedies and I bet you can think of the grand gesture, the pivotal romantic moment, in each.  In "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMFQ">Love Actually</a>" there are at least three of them, and what passes for one in "The Holiday" has to do with (surprise, surprise) Iris and Arthur.  Watching this film was enjoyable enough, but they basically fast forward to the requisite happy ending without making these characters even try to earn our tears and I am rounding up on this only because of the scenes between Wallach and Winslet.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>The plot is kind of unbelievable.  In one night two strangers switch houses without knowing eachother at all!!  Cameron Diaz' acting was interesting, as if she just had begun her acting career.  Jude's two daughters in the movie were totaly freaky (" 'elo Amanda' ", and were they having some sort of orgy in that tent?  Kate played her part very well I thought.  The movie wasn't that great, it was predictable, with happy ending and all....but it gave me a few laughs (mostly at it's stupidity), but still, I laughed.  Why was Jack Black in this movie????Enjoy the mind numbing experience with your freinds so you can make fun of the movie together ;) enjoy.<br /><br />p.s. scrooda-lee-doo</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Between the pairs Kate Winslet - Jack Black in L.A. and Cameron Diaz - Jude Law in U.K., I must say the L.A. pair was the more interesting to watch. Kate Winslet showed heart (kind to the elderly neighbour), taste  and intelligence with a longing for true love. Jack Black showed sense. And the big, spacious and ambient L.A. mansion surely helps a lot.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz - Jude Law 's storyline in Surrey, on the other hand, appears to be shallow and unconvincing. The chemistry between Cameron and Jude seem to be non-existing. When they first met in the Surrey cottage, the way they giggled, conversed and the things they said were teenage stuff and predictable. No way could this be an indispensable and successful Hollywood trailer maker with a sharp sense. However, there were shots of the picturesque Surrey cottage that were simply postcard perfect. The movie could do a lot better if the story in Surrey is given more substance and heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>This could have been a good movie, but at 130 min(!!), it was downright<br /><br />dull in several spots, especially a lot of plodding, cutesy conversation<br /><br />between Law and Diaz (neither one can i stand much, and rather smell<br /><br />as actors anyways).  Take out a half hour of that schlock, and the movie<br /><br />could have worked, especially with the funky duo of Winslet and Black (now those are entertainers!).  Actually, the WHOLE MOVIE should have just been about those two, duh!  Why can't i be a producer, "with a hit show on broadway, la la la". (-:</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's a strange thing reviewing a romantic comedy since, as a single guy, it almost defeats the purpose of a movie like this. This was meant to be rented with your significant other, dimmed lights and all, and enjoying it with just the two of you. So can the movie exist for a single person? Possibly. It'll either make you nostalgic for relationships that actually worked, or depressed that you're not in one that idyllic. It's also a bit too much of a movie but at least it's quite charming anyway.<br /><br />Los Angeles film producer Amanda has just thrown out her cheating boyfriend and needs a break. She goes online and finds a unique site: you can swap houses for a couple weeks and you stay at their place and they stay at yours. This is attractive to Iris, England native who has unrequited love for her possessive cad of an ex-boyfriend. They swap houses and pretty soon Amanda strikes a relationship with Iris' brother Graham while Iris meets an aging screenwriting legend and meets Miles, a film composer. Both women get caught up in possible relationships with both aware that their stay isn't permanent.<br /><br />Like in some multiple storyline films, there's always that one that you feel more interested in. For Babel, I was more compelled by the Japanese storyline than anything and the Mexico segments of Traffic were completely better than the rest. Here, I tend to get more interested in the Kate Winslet/Jack Black story simply because Winslet just feels like a more endearing character. I don't think she's ever been this adorable, however the fault comes from the relationship with Black since it develops at an almost slow burn and it just doesn't have the chemistry it needs. The Cameron Diaz/Jude Law story feels the more adult but for some reason I didn't get that drawn into it.<br /><br />2 things bugged me about the film. One, is that there's a bit of pretentious parts in the film, as if writer/director Nancy Meyers wanted to use characters to unleash some Hollywood lowblows such as the old screenwriter (Eli Wallach) lamenting about the age that didn't have DVD, Blockbuster and cineplexes. Then there's the big one where he says outright a film has to "make money on the first weekend or it'll fail". I didn't mind the film professions some of the characters had but to be that nailing on the head just seemed out of place. The other is the length where it just feels too long for a romantic comedy. It helps build films and depth but here it feels almost unneeded.<br /><br />I don't know if it'll work for couples since I watched it as a single guy but taken as such, it's pretty good but probably not really great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>This big Hollywood romantic comedy is a real throwback to the golden age when they made these kinds of gushy films, replete with a setting around Christmas, as if the romantic emotions weren't enough of a hook. The four leads all do well, but it's a little jarring to see portly Jack Black trying to play a romantic leading man against Jude Law. Still, Black really ain't half bad here. The swelling music contributes to the overall throwback feel. They even throw in a dose of Hollywood self-glorification with Eli Wallach as the 90-year-old screenwriter rescued from oblivion by an adoring Kate Winslett. We must endure her in the throes of worship for the old films the old codger wrote. Ick. Get over yourself, Hollywood.

It is a stretch to think that Jack Black could end up with Kate Winslet in real life, but hey, maybe there is hope out there for us guys without the six-pack abs and metro-sexual attitudes.  The fact that all this is supposed to take place in two weeks is stretching the imagination a bit, but movies are supposed to entertain, and this one does.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Sony / Region A<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACS<br />Running time: 2:15:41<br />Movie size: 38,479,620,096 bytes<br />Disc size: 43,197,591,142 bytes<br />Total bit rate: 37.81 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 29.63 Mbps<br /><br />LPCM Audio  English  4608 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 4608 kbps / 16-bit<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, English, French, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 16<br /><br />#Audo Commentary with Director / Writer<br />#The Making of The Holiday<br />#Theatrical Trailers</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Madonna sang once "holiday, celebrate, if you took a holiday, some time to celebrate, it would be ..it would be so nice." Holiday is more than nice, it is superb romantic comedy, about two modern ladies who do the geographic cure by swapping houses to get over broken hearts.<br /><br />Iris is a London journalist who is in love with Jasper, a selfish columnist who is engaged but wants to have his cake and eat it too. Amanda is a Hollywood trailer producer who just ended yet another relationship with her cheating semi live-in boyfriend. When the two women connect on a house swap site to get away from it all they find themselves in unexpected romances.<br /><br />Once they arrive at their polar opposite locations love finds them. Iris connects with film score composer Miles whose as decent as Jasper is awful. Iris also befriends a legendary Hollywood writer named Arthur who tells her to be the leading lady by having her watch movie of strong women characters.<br /><br />Amanda falls head over heels with Iris' brother Graham whose nursing his own broken heart after being left a widowed single father. As they live two different lives the ladies find parts of themselves that had gone missing a long time ago.<br /><br />A similar movie with an almost identical plot line is Tara Road starring Andie MacDowell.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R2RL9Y">Tara Road (2005)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A very pleasant surprise, The Holiday, is a romantic comedy that brings to the screen the parallel stories of two young women who travel to each other's countries to get over their troubles with the men in their lives only to find true love.<br /><br />The Holiday is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the MUSIC (!!!) are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Holiday is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 1/2 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet play two women whose boyfriends have just broken up with them in order to be with another woman.  They both want to get away and manage to do this by swapping houses.  Diaz has a mansion in L.A. whereas Winslet lives in a quaint English cottage.  When they arrive at their vacation homes, they both find romance, but not without some complications.  Both women show a nice flair for comedy and they are both likeable heroines.  This is a pleasant movie which will probably appeal to the women in the audience more than to the men.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>I am not a big Nancy Meyers fan, but I did enjoy What Women Want and thought I'd give this a whirl.  The Holiday is a sweet, feel-good romantic movie that impresses in some areas and underwhelms in others.  More on that later. Amanda (Cameron Diaz), a creator of movie trailers from L.A., has just broken up with her boyfriend and wants to get away and be alone for a while. Iris (Kate Winslet), a London newspaper writer, is heartbroken as well.  The man, a colleague, she loves and has pined over for years has become engaged to another woman and she wants to put some distance between them.  So when Amanda finds a home exchange travel program on the Internet (using Google, a very obvious product placement ad within the film) and finds the perfect vacation spot -- a small, picturesque cottage in Surrey, England -- she contacts the owner (Iris) and they agree to trade places for a couple of weeks.  Iris has the time of her life in L.A., where she meets some interesting people (including a retired screenwriter played by veteran actor Elli Wallach) and becomes friends with a sweet film music composer (Jack Black), whereas Amanda is bored out of her mind... until she meets Iris's gorgeous and enigmatic brother (Jude Law).<br /><br />This is the sort of movie you either want to enjoy with your girlfriends or watch by yourself when you're in the mood for something warm and fuzzy.  The script is well written and it isn't the typical romantic comedy in that the characters are one-dimensional for the most part.  In this film, you get moving performances, especially from Kate Winslet.  She once again showcases her talent in this one and her character's kindness and transparency to loving and caring for others is wonderful.  I was also impressed with the fact that she and Black had chemistry.  I often avoid a Jack Black movie like the plague, but he was actually endearing in this film.  Cameron Diaz underwhelms as Amanda though.  She played a character not unlike most of her romantic comedy heroines.  Even though I liked the chemistry between her and Jude Law, I found myself more interested in Winslet and Black.  As for the setting, I loved the beautiful takes of Iris's English cottage and the village she lives in.  They were so much more eye-catching than the mansions and palm trees in Los Angeles.  All in all, this is a great film.  The DVD is not that great though.  The picture quality is not that great and you don't get any special features (at least not the one I got).  I recommend you rent this one before you decide to own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>When Los Angeles workaholic Amanda breaks up with her boyfriend, she needs a place where she can go and take her mind off things. At the same time, British newspaper journalist Iris realizes that she will never live happily ever after with the ex-boyfriend she's been pining after for three years. The two decide to swap lives, in effect, and each live in the other's home for two weeks.<br /><br />In the beginning, Amanda thinks she's made a mistake and books herself a flight back to La La Land. Then enters Iris's charming older brother, Graham, who sweeps Amanda off her feet in what she expects to be a one-night stand but turns out to be much more. Iris, on the other hand, has a great time in Los Angeles from the very beginning and makes friends with an elderly screenwriter who is Amanda's neighbor. Their friendship forms the foundation that allows her to forget about her ex and move on with her life.<br /><br />The Holiday is, as other reviewers have noted, two romantic comedies in one. Cameron Diaz is endearingly neurotic as the workaholic Amanda who is so busy running a successful business she doesn't have time to have sex with her boyfriend. When she meets Graham and finally allows herself to let her guard down, it was a perfect romantic comedy moment complete with the complicated plot twist (which I won't give away, but let's just say Graham's been keeping secrets). Similarly, Iris lets herself be walked on by the object of her affection for so long that she forgets that she does deserve to be loved back by someone who will appreciate her. The relationship that she forms with Amanda's neighbor gives her the gumption to finally stand up for herself and stop being a doormat. This movie was a cute and funny romantic comedy, and my only complaint is that--at over 2 hours--it was a bit longer than I expected or was necessary. Other than that, it was enjoyable and entertaining.<br /><br />Also, I originally thought The Holiday must have been based on the Jane Green novel Swapping Lives, which has a similar home exchange between a Brit and an American, but since the two were released within six months of each other, I guess that's not the case. Still, if you enjoy this film, you might want to check out Swapping Lives for a different perspective on the same story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>The movie was a lot better than I expected.  It was an entertaining movie though not one you can probably see more than once.  Jude Law and Cameron Diaz have an amazing chemistry while I didn't get the same feel between Kate Winslet and Jack Black (Black just doesn't seem to cut it as a love interest).<br /><br />Law lives with his two daughters and there are some very touching scenes with how they take to Diaz and invite her to be in their bedroom tent.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The movie is a bit long for the story, but overall has a few bright moments.  I thought that the part with the 91 year old Eli Walach was one of the bright moments to enjoy.<br /><br />The two female romantic leads are Cameron Diaz (a southern California advertising VIP that creates movie trailers) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) an English wedding column writer who lives in a quaint cottage in the English countryside.<br /><br />They both need a break from the men who complicate their lives.  By chance both Amanda and Iris find each other through an Internet site that specializes in home exchanges for short-term get-a-ways.  Amanda and Iris are thousands of miles away from each other but both are excited to change homes and cross continents to move into each other's homes for two weeks.<br /><br />Iris lands in Amanda's Los Angeles home, and Amanda lands in Iris's English cottage.<br /><br />Each young woman has a eye-opening adventure and learn of new and deep relationships in their unfamiliar settings.<br /><br />Iris helps Arthur (Eli Wallach) who is a screenwriter from Hollywood's golden days.  He has her watch movies of strong female lead and Iris helps him find the confidence to face his past and accept some praise from his peers.  Iris also finds true love in Los Angeles (Jack Black).<br /><br />Amanda meets Iris's handsome brother (Jude Law) as he comes knocking at the cottage door.  She learns that he is a widower with two small children, and discovers that even though she does not want to risk vulnerability, she finds love and trust to ask for the family she wants.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Don't jump to the ceiling yet, don't get up into the sky. That's not the film of the next century, nor decade. That's not even the comedy of the present decade. It is just a decent comedy, romantic, sentimental and happy to the highest uppermost acme of what we can conceive as a happy ending. In fact the structure is Shakespearian to the very detail in every scene. "As You like It" is the model and here we are even nearly modest, shy about the happy ending. Shakespeare managed to have four marriages at the end of his play, and he will do it again at the end of his "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Here we have only two couples who find their happy ending in England, because frankly such a thing cannot happen in Los Angeles the country of fake make-believe. The real stuff can only happen in the depth of Surrey, with a cow in the back garden and a tent in the girl's bedroom. But it is funny and at the same time it is slightly ironically critical of what Hollywood has become in its superficial illusionary virtual reality based on special effects and canned sentiments and roles, when it is not preserved music that comes out of the brain of an elevator, even if the British may call that a lift that can lift your fat, flesh and bones but will never lift, not to speak of elevating, your artistic and musical senses. And to prove his point, the director, though I should say directress to be accurate even if that is not politically correct and I cannot use a word like directing person that has not yet succeeded to escalator-ize itself up to the tip of my tongue, has a cameo of an aging Dustin Hoffman appearing in the aisles of a DVD store in the background of "The Graduate" where he was a juicy short student looking for the way to lose his maidenhead or should I say bachelor-head between the legs of a ripe woman. Maybe Hollywood might be becoming in the coming decade realistic and more human, closer to real life, probably under the influence of the competition that is already simmering in India, in China, in Asia in general, and in Europe of course, though Europe is still bogged up in the mud of the tradition of cultural protectionism which is nothing but the impotence in front of the challenge that comes from outside. A funny film and a question at the end: how in hell are they going to fly a cow from London's Heathrow Airport to Los Angeles International Airport? I guess Air France will volunteer since they are the European specialist of the air-lift of all kinds of cattle in between two strikes when the passengers are treated by the striking personnel as samples of the valueless cattle that deserves nothing  but being sent to the local slaughterhouse to get out of the way of their resistance to change and restructuring, just before the company is bought up by Air China or Aeroflot, now Russian millionaires are buying newspapers in France, and elsewhere.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>As a guy, let me be blunt about this:  this is a chick flick.  Leaving the preview showing of this film last night, the women I heard talking about it were gushing.  As I told my female friend I saw it with, I can easily imagine a scenario being constantly repeating itself over the holidays:  a couple arrives at the multiplex to see a movie.  He opts for ROCKY BALBOA, she for THE HOLIDAY.  The ensuing debate could be the end of many relationships.<br /><br />But guys, trust me on this one.  If you are in a relationship and want to make your woman happy, take her to see THE HOLIDAY.  This is going to go down as one of the best chick flicks of recent years.  And while it is obviously slanted to the ladies, I think most guys will like much of it as well.  It is not a perfect movie.  Though the reviewer below who made the absurd claim that the boom mike was constantly seen is flat out wrong, many of the scenes suffer from poor timing (usually the result of poor editing).  It is also astoundingly predictable.  If you know anything about the plot (i.e., if you have seen the preview) you know not only how it ends but most of the main plot developments.  But that is partly the point.  It is intended as a holiday feel good movie, and over the years it has been proven through tried and true methods precisely what makes folks feel good.  So, while the comic scenes don't scintillate like those from the great comic movies Eli Wallach's character in the film tells Kate Winslet's to see, they do add up to something satisfying in the end.<br /><br />The film revolves around two women in bad relationships--one in L.A. (Cameron Diaz) and one in Surrey, England (Kate Winslet)--wanting desperately to get away from their immediate surroundings to get some breathing room.  So they discover each other on a house exchange website, and Kate agrees to go to L.A. and Cameron to Surrey.  The houses, unlike the imagined boom mikes of the previous reviewer, do indeed feel like characters in the film, Winslet's almost impossibly picturesque cottage marvelously counterbalancing Diaz's ultra-stylish Hollywood estate.  Of course, both of them meet new men.  Cameron Diaz meets Winslet's brother, played by Jude Law, who instead of being sleazily charming as he so often is, is here merely charming.  And Kate Winslet meets not one but two men, one played by Jack Black, her eventual love interest.  The other man is Eli Wallach, who plays a veteran screenwriter from Hollywood's Golden Age.  I don't know if he is based on any one writer, but his output would compare with someone like Samson Raphaelson, the writer of many of Ernst Lubitsch's best scripts, including TROUBLE IN PARADISE, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (he also wrote the short story that THE JAZZ SINGER was based on)  Also, Raphaelson was famously married to a former Ziegfield Follies performer to whom he was married for 66 years, and the character in this film was married for decades with someone who fit that bill.  I actually started thinking of Wallach as Raphaelson, partly because he recommended a list of classic comedies to Winslet, none of them the classics written by Raphaelson himself (she watches at least HIS GIRL FRIDAY, THE LADY EVE, and something with Irene Dunne, most probably THE AWFUL TRUTH).  But since Raphaelson retired to New York, the parallels are not precise.  I very much enjoyed the friendship that Winslet strikes up with the very old Wallach.  (I had such a gut feeling that the character Arthur Abbot was based on Raphaelson that I tried to see if writer/director Nancy Meyer had any connections to him, for instance as a student at Columbia, where Raphaelson taught the last few years of his life.  And without any proof to the contrary, I'll persist in that belief.)<br /><br />The film is merciless in its (largely successful) attempts to manipulate your heart.  One of the characters turns out to have two daughters who are cute beyond description.  One reason the film gets away with so much is that the performers all are superb.  Winslet is just Winslet.  Diaz is far more likable here than in most of her more recent films.  Jack Black plays a more subdued version of himself.  And Jude Law is Jude Law.<br /><br />All in all, I think few will be disappointed in this film.  Yeah, maybe those guys who couldn't quite talk their dates into BORAT or ROCKY BALBOA may suffer enormously through the movie's more than two hours length, but I think virtually all women are going to adore it, and I think most men are going like it more than they suspect.  And as chick flick go, it sure beats BEACHES.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"The Holiday" is the kind of film that will stand the test of time and has the potential to be a Christmas perennial.  A real cynic could dismiss this charming flick.  How can you dislike a film that cites the moxy of Irene Dunne and the genius of Ennio Morricone?  Give director-writer Nancy Myers kudos for having the chutzpah to reference classic old movies and making one that doesn't compare unfavorably to them.  Also cite the film's top-flight cast(Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Jack Black) who give sincere performances that bely schmaltz.  Eli Wallach nearly steals the show here as an aged Hollywood screenwriter who Winslet befriends.  I initially saw this film after a ragged day of Christmas shopping with my wife.  I liked it well enough but the waterworks were going with my wife.  It's on a second viewing that the film really grew on me and convinced me of it's staying power.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>And he's not really a Mexican bandito, he's just an old Jewish guy. haw haw<br /><br />In the category of date movies, this is a pretty decent film. If you can process the ludicrous possibility of two total strangers swapping houses, automobiles, and pets for two weeks then you'll probably love this thing. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz provide quite a contrast with Kate as a love starved newspaper editor pining away for the ultra-hateable and totally reprehensible, as usual, Rufus Sewell. And Diaz as a very successful workaholic movie trailer maker whose approach towards relationships can be summed up as she is throwing her live-in Ed Burns out into the street..."NOBODY has time for sex."<br /><br />Next thing you know, these two have met online and agreed to swap houses for the holiday. Its all very cute and there are actually some pretty funny moments as these two acclimate themselves to their new surroundings in Surrey England and somewhere in the vicinity of Beverly Hills. And as this is a film that requires you to check your rational mind at the door, as soon as Cameron is getting settled in, the charming brother in the form of widower Jude Law shows up knocking on the front door and threatening to "take a piss" (they do that in England I think), then he is invited in for a glass of wine and some casual sex. Likewise, as Winslet is enjoying her new digs, Jack Black (who reminds me of what you would get if Joan Crawford had a child with the Hunchback of Notre Dame) shows up with the ultra-hot Shannyn Sossamon as his girlfriend (see, I told ya!)and we're off and running.<br /><br />There's plenty of charm to go around, and most of it provided by Law's daughters. Nothing more charming than two little girls with British accents (see The Rule of Mary Poppins).  The relationship between Diaz and the brother is pretty cool as she comes out of her sexual shell and discovers that she's staring a ready made family right in the knickers. Then across the pond you have Winslet, Wallach, and Jack Black. Hmmmn.<br /><br />This is a classic chick flick, and does make for a good date movie. Face it, this DVD is not going into your collection. Makes for an amusing evening though. BTW, at 2 hours 16 minutes people will argue over whether this movie was TOO long. 3 Passports</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>The Holiday is the perfect movie to watch after you just finish a relationship, because it gives hope to men and women that there is a special someone for them. The movie is about two women trying to get over their last relationship and to do so they switching houses for the holidays. During the switch the two girls find the meaning of real love. In Iris's (Kate Winslet) case she was still in love with her ex that had left her for another woman, sometimes as women we tend to hold on to things that make us feel happy for moments but at the same times makes very unhappy. While Iris is in California she finds a new friend, a 90 year old man who advices her that by holding on to a friendship with her ex and that now takes advantage of her feeling towards him for his own benefit, is only hurting her. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) in the other side of the world finds a Graham (Jude Law) a man who has trouble showing who he really is; she discovers that is her problem too, and in the short time they spend together they find a way to be happy with themselves.  Iris finds Miles (Jack Black), who is going through something very similar to what she went through and helps him to solve it, and at the end get together.  Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet make this movie great. They both shine equally and neither tries to steal the limelight. This is one of the first roles that Kate has done as a comedy and it she does it very well.  If you want to lighten up your personal emotional baggage, set your life in perspective, here is movie that might just do that for you.

One of these stories works, only occasionally veering into sitcom territory. The other stays firmly rooted in sitcom purgatory. Interestingly, the story that works also stars the better actress. I'll give you one hint. The better actress isn't Cameron Diaz.<br /><br />Amanda (Cameron Diaz), the owner of a company that edits movie trailers, breaks up with her boyfriend, Ethan (Edward Burns). Because Christmas is just around the corner, she doesn't want to spend the holiday alone, so she decides to travel. She explores a few websites and then comes across a home exchange program, decides on England and finds a photo of a cottage in Surrey, forty minutes outside of London. The owner of the cottage, Iris (Kate Winslet), a columnist at a London newspaper, is trying to come to terms with her unrequited love of Jasper (Rufus Sewell), another columnist at the paper. She still holds out hope, until his engagement to another woman is announced at the company Christmas party. That night, she receives an e-mail from Amanda. "Is your cottage still available?" The next day, each is jetting off to the other's countries. Iris is overjoyed to find Amanda's home has a large kitchen, a gym, a swimming pool and more. She immediately makes herself at home. She meets Arthur (Eli Wallach), an aging widower who lives next door. Arthur used to write movies, in the 40s, and Iris is immediately drawn into his tales of old Hollywood. One day, Miles (Jack Black), a film composer, stops by to pick up some of Ethan's things. After a while, they form a friendship and help each other deal with their respective relationship problems. In England, Amanda soon realizes the error of her thinking (naturally, the first thing you want to do to keep from feeling lonely is to fly to a foreign country, alone, for the holidays) and is ready to fly back to Los Angeles when Graham (Jude law), Iris' brother arrives on her doorstep. They immediately sleep together and Amanda decides England isn't such a bad place after all.<br /><br />"The Holiday" continues a trend established by writer - producer - director Nancy Meyers. For every hit, she follows with two or three flops. She made "Baby Boom" and followed that with some forgettable films. In the last few years, she has made "What Woman Want" and then "Something's Gotta Give", a critical and financial hit starring Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson in one of their best performances. So that makes "The Holiday" a...<br /><br />Actually, it isn't a flop. Not exactly. It is just extremely uneven.<br /><br />Let's start with the good.<br /><br />Kate Winslet has always been an extremely likable and believable actress. In each of her films, she is able to create a character we can believe in, even when the story veers off into fantastical realms. A large part of this ability comes from her extremely `normal' looks; Winslet is very pretty and nice to watch, but she isn't a bombshell. She looks like a normal person, which makes it easier to accept her in this type of role.<br /><br />As Iris, she makes the character sympathetic, interesting and intelligent. When she receives the news of Jasper's engagement, she travels home in a fog. Upon her arrival, she immediately lets the water works flow and she can't seem to stop. As soon as she arrives in Los Angeles, her joy at the sight of Amanda's home is almost palpable; most of us would also be overjoyed to find a mansion at our feet, ready to use for our holiday. When she meets Arthur, she befriends him out a mixture of human interest and neediness. After she gives him a ride home, she realizes he is a lonely old man and invites him to dinner where he begins to share stories of his days in old Hollywood and she becomes entranced.<br /><br />Then, she meets Miles. He is in a relationship with an actress, Maggie (Shannon Shassoman, "A Knight's Tale") and even though he feels a little bit of a spark, he is clearly in love with his girlfriend and just wants to be friends with Amanda. They form a bond as they work on an event featuring Arthur, growing closer and closer. Then, his relationship with Maggie changes and they each demonstrate their growing attraction.<br /><br />The key to this story, its believability, is that it is played fairly straight. There are occasional moments when it veers into sitcom territory, such as when Black starts singing the signature tunes of his favorite scores, but for the most part, it is believable, sweet and sincere.<br /><br />Black is also surprisingly good as Miles. It is by far his most natural, believable performance in many years. Because he is in a relationship with Maggie when he meets Iris, he isn't able to show his feelings. But there is an attraction there and they become friends, both becoming involved with Arthur's life. Then, when he realizes he has been cheated on, Miles realizes he has the perfect mate standing right in front of him.<br /><br />Both Iris and Miles share similar relationship troubles and they compliment each other nicely. When Mile`s ex-girlfriend says she wants him back, he naturally runs to her side, much like Iris is willing to drop everything for Jasper. The moment when they each realize their current relationships are not going to work is also handled well and believable. As they develop a bond, we watch with interest.<br /><br />Then there is the Amanda story. Two of the reasons Amanda's boyfriend cheats on her are: she is unable to cry and she is obsessed with work, to the point that she had an edit suite installed in her home. Meyers seems to feel these two items allow her license to make Amanda as much like Lucy Ricardo as possible. Throughout the film, we see shots of Cameron Diaz trying to cry, squinting her eyes up, in an attempt to be emotional. These come off as fake as they sound. Perhaps a more talented actress would have been able to make this work. Perhaps. Early in the film, Amanda visits her edit suite and watches the newest trailer her assistant has finished, an action film featuring Lindsay Lohan and James Franco (a nice touch of comedy since the actors are actually in the trailer and it appears to be very `Hollywood'.) Later, "Holiday" shows us a trailer version of Amanda's relationship woes, complete with grave, serious narration. Later, the narration returns, but no visual. They didn't take this joke far enough. It is a funny idea; naturally, anyone so obsessed with their job would begin to see everything in familiar terms. But to only see one trailer depicting her sad love life? This isn't enough.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Diaz is always talking, running off at the mouth, making Amanda an extremely annoying character. In every scene, she launches into a lengthy monologue about some state of her relationship with someone. Amanda and Graham start to make jokes about her incessant talking, but it doesn't make the character more believable. At one point, she complains about all of the books she hasn't read. Yeeeeesssshhhhh!<br /><br />The entire film is grounded in a world of fairy tales. From Iris' snow bound cottage to the fact both women jet off to a foreign country to share their homes the day after they meet, this is clearly not a story happening in the real world. At one point, after Iris meets Arthur, he talks about the "Meet Cute" moments in romantic comedies. "A man and a woman go to a department store. Each wants to buy pajamas, but the man says he just needs the bottoms and the woman says she just needs a top. That's a Meet Cute moment". "The Holiday" attempts its own Meet Cute. Graham arrives on Iris' doorstep stinking drunk. Because his sister left so quickly, he doesn't know she is gone until he meets Amanda. After a brief conversation, they realize neither wants a relationship, and Amanda is planning to leave the next day, so they, naturally, decide to sleep together. This is a phenomenally bad idea. Not only does it rob the film, or at least this story's part of the film, of any romance, it makes both Amanda and Graham slightly unlikable. Yes, Graham is good looking and Amanda is attractive, but why would they sleep together five minutes after they meet? The relationship has nowhere to go from there, except down.<br /><br />Because Jude Law's Graham is in the Amanda story, he naturally suffers by association. But Meyers is clearly trying to amp up the charming factor of Law's persona. Many people have compared him to Cary Grant and "The Holiday" seems to be trying to encourage this. Graham is from Surrey, where Cary Grant was born, a fact not lost on the film as it is mentioned in the dialogue. Then, in one scene, Law dons glasses which look extremely similar to the same type of glasses worn by Grant in the classic Howard Hawk's comedy "Bringing Up Baby", yet another fact I doubt is lost on Meyers. So, throughout the film, Law appears charming and attractive and every bit the leading man he should be. If he would only appear in better films.<br /><br />Eli Wallach has a sweet turn as Arthur, the aging widower living next door to Amanda. As he and Iris form a friendship, Iris learns the Writer's Guild has been pestering him to let them host a salute to him. She also learns they want to do it next week, yet another fairy tale element of the film. This allows for Iris to still be in town for the big event, but is a completely implausible story point. These types of events take months to plan. That aside, it allows for Arthur and Iris to work towards this event and the moment Arthur steps into the auditorium is a nice moment.<br /><br />The final moment of "The Holiday" is easily the worst conclusion I have seen in a film all year. It almost seems like Meyers had no idea how to end the film, felt it was necessary to have at least one scene with both Winslet and Diaz and came up with what ends the film. It doesn't work. At all. It seems like one of those bad films from the 60s or 70s, when all of the main characters start dancing at the end of the film, as though there is simply not enough money left to shoot that final scene, the one that provides a resolution to the story. Yes, it seems exactly like that.<br /><br />"The Holiday" is a mixed bag. Some might enjoy the story with Iris and her two friends,  and Arthur. But you will have to sit through an interminable amount of overacting on the part of Cameron Diaz. I'm not sure the film is worth that agony.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>jack black was an out-of-place miscast. he acted very badly in this movie. maybe because before this movie, he never seriously played a romantic figure. it resulted him acting so poorly just with his comic funny pretentious facial movements. the californian part in this movie was weaker than the part in england. contrite, cliched and boring, like watching a goodwill charity show. assisting the old screenwriter part was like watching social security's program to fill up an hollow and empty storyline. there's no way to imagine the english woman would have possibly fall for that comedian-like guy. there's no chemistry at all between them, both just acting dutifully to fulfill the mismatched cast. kate winslet obviously felt jack black's embarrassing miscast and showed some struggles to follow the script. she tried so hard to perform a role out of a bad script. i too, felt embarrassed every time when she got to play out the scenes with jack black. the scene shot in the blockbuster was such a stupid and totally unnecessary part that should be deleted.<br /><br />the reason why i decided to watch this movie was because i just curiously wondered why with such  strong cast, the general movie critics still thought it sucked big time. but then i totally understood why it's just marginally watchable. this is a very unbalanced movie with two strong & weak parts, further weakened by overly long blahblahblah script and the jack black miscast. a movie that would be only possible for you to sit through in x'mas.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The film, as a whole, works marginally well; enough to validate seeing it and enjoying it but not enough to really constitute adoring it.  As far as romantic comedies go, `The Holiday' gets it half right.<br /><br />The half they get right is the one starring Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.<br /><br />The film tells paralleled stories of two woman exchanging homes for a much needed break from reality.  Iris is currently devastated that her ex-boyfriend Jasper is now engaged to a co-worker.  Amanda is disgusted with her cheating boyfriend and overwhelmed by her job.  The two, in an act of desperation, exchange lives (homes, cars...the whole shebang) and attempt to unwind and refocus.  Of course, where there are desperate women there are kind hearted men who are tailor-made for helping them `refocus', and so insert Jude Law and...um...Jack Black?  Law plays Graham, Iris's brother, who infiltrates Amanda's alone time and makes himself a staple in her `healing'.  Jack Black plays Miles, a music composer who ignites a spark in Iris.<br /><br />The script and pacing of the film only half work.<br /><br />I will say that what I did enjoy about the film and that balance of `two stories' was that it was able to bounce around so that we didn't lose complete interest in the couples in question, which it would have been very easy to do.  Sadly though, the film is overly long and the couples themselves, at least Winslet and Black, are miscast.  Diaz and Law are quite good, especially Law who kind of OWNS this movie.  I love Kate Winslet with all my almighty heart and consider her an acting goddess and the single best working actress today, but romantic comedies are not her thing.  She just comes off dull and uninteresting, especially in the films first half.  She does pick up her pace a bit towards the end, but by then we have lost interest and moved on to Diaz, who is totally in her element and shines brightly here.  Black tries, and he works better than expected, but you can tell that he is in over his head.<br /><br />Nancy Meyers has a certain way about making her movies.  She understands certain aspects of the love game, but she also doesn't know how to edit herself.  I remember a similar problem (although not as unevenly toned) in `Something's Gotta Give', a film that hit a lot of great marks and then allowed itself to wear out its own welcome.  That is a problem I have with `The Holiday'.  It is too loosely constructed.  Some tighter pacing and some much needed edits could have consolidated this film and made it move quicker and hit harder.  Instead, it tends to drag on in places and loses some of its charm along the way.<br /><br />The film as a whole is ok, but I wanted more than that.</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>I don't recall ever hearing the name of Nancy Meyers before.  Yet she took a lot on in this production, with both the writing and directing duties.  My feeling is that she is an unusually talented writer, a decent director, and a below-average casting director.<br /><br />Set in LA and England, Amanda Woods (Diaz) and Miles (Black) work together putting together movie trailers.  Woods breaks up with her boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) after she finds out he had an affair.  Miles is in a relationship with a seemingly more stable girlfriend Maggie, who turns out to not be so stable.  Meanwhile, in London, Iris Simpkins (Winslet) has been carrying on a three-year, one-sided affair with co-worker Jasper (Rufus Sewell), while her brother Graham (Jude Law) is busy editing books.  Iris finds out Jasper is engaged with a girl in the circulation department, and has her heart crushed in front of all of her co-workers.  Amanda and Iris are ready for a change.  That comes when they agree to switch houses for the Christmas holiday.<br /><br />In any movie, things have to be believable.  That of course can be stretched in, say, a science fiction movie because we know there is no such thing as time travel, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and there are (unfortunately) no monsters on Mars waiting to attack us as soon as we set foot there.<br /><br />But in a movie such as 'The Holiday', the arc of the relationships have to work, because the whole movie is ABOUT the relationships!  The sumptuous look of the film isn't matched by the casting choices.  In the DVD special feature, writer/director Meyers says she 'loves' Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet and Jack Black.  Well, who doesn't?  At least in individual roles they really fit in.  I loved Jack Black in School of Rock.  He was just perfect.  Here, he isn't.  There is zero chemistry between the staid Winslet, who plays a newspaper reporter in London's Daily Telegraph, and Black, who is back to his music by portraying a composer for the movies and movie trailers.  Try as he might, Black just doesn't fit well with Winslet at all.<br /><br />The other pairing in the film, Diaz with Jude Law is equally unbelievable.  Diaz, in the Meg Ryan role (ditsy blonde, long in heart and cutesy) had nothing in common with the down-to-earth Law.  They just don't fit, and you don't believe for a minute that these two could really end up together.<br /><br />Ironically, if the male leads were switched, the chemistry might actually work, especially with the non-manic Winslet and the equally settled Law.  The potential match between Black and Diaz might be a bit less convincing, because, let's face it, Diaz is a major beauty, and Black is always ruffled, no matter how often is shirt and pants are ironed.  Still, you could see it.<br /><br />But you just NEVER buy the pairing as put forth in this film.<br /><br />I must comment, however, on the sparkling writing of Ms. Meyers.  This woman can write dialog with the best I've run across in the past decade.  Her writing is such that you notice how excellent it is, and you make a point of find out who came up with this.  There's one scene with Jude Law talking to Diaz about how to make their relationship work that has pacing, inflection, cadence and lyrical tone that is just outstanding.<br /><br />Oh, and a note about Eli Wallach, who turned 90 during the filming.  His character (Aurthur Abbott) is sweet and light-hearted and wonderful.  He plays a writer (I suspect Meyers chose that career because of her own talents) who has won many awards, but 'hasn't been busy since 1978'. Iris (Winslet) finds out that the Hollywood community wants to honor a lifetime of writing, but he doesn't want to go.  Winslet convinces him to go, and Abbott finds out that many haven't forgotten about him after all.  Not to put a fine point on it, but the Winslet-Wallach pairing DOES have chemistry.  Their personalities mesh with a 50 year age difference better that the putative pairings of the film.<br /><br />Over all, three stars.  One star only for the casting.  Terrible, and it ruins the film.  Five stars for the writing.  Four stars for the actors when they are not with their supposed 'magical matches'.  Two stars for Black and Diaz when they are with Winslet and Law, and four stars for acting for Winslet and Law with they are with their 'mates'.  Simply, they are more talented actors/actresses.<br /><br />It's sad this is such a miss because of the casting.  With believable pairing, this could have been special.  The worst choice? Diaz.  There doesn't seem to be much heart in that girl at all.  She comes across as all surface.  I didn't like her in the role at all.  Poor choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Kate Winslet is Iris, a prim young Englishwoman whose unrequitted love for a seemingly clueless ex-boyfriend is eating her alive.  Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a rather spastic American businesswoman for whom love has once again proven an unfaithful affair.  When the two swap houses for a two-week holiday at Chritmas time, will it be the new beginning both women need, or just another pitfall in the jungle of life?<br /><br />It's a good plot, and one the leads carry off remarkably well.  Winslet and Diaz each do a good job of bringing their well-written roles to life, and Jude Law, Rufus Sewell and Jack Black are equally strong as the men in their lives.  Eli Wallach is great in a surprising and important role as a retired Hollywood screenwriter, and the friendship between he and Iris is stirring to watch develop.  The aforementioned script is rich and well-conceived, rarely descending to the low level common to most romantic comedies, and the opening monologue from Iris in which she bares her soul and describes the pangs of unrequitted love is the essence of truth.<br /><br />Though not what I would call a cinema classic, THE HOLIDAY is an enjoyable, frequently inspiring date movie that I am glad to have taken my wife to.  Recommended to all couples who love watching movies together.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Movie making and politics have grown remarkably similar.  In both cases, products are packaged not on merit - much less vision - but on marketability.  Candidates don't bravely craft innovative platforms and then sell their merits to the public, they simply figure out what the public wants to hear and then devise catchy ways of saying it.  Likewise, many filmmakers avoid artistic risk and creativity, settling instead for products that will sell.  Nancy Meyers, who wrote and directed The Holiday, has clearly targeted women as her market, particularly women who are drawn to frothy, weepy, dim-witted romanticism and sentimentality.  In What Women Want, she actually hit some high notes.  In The Holiday, poor writing, a clich&eacute; fiesta, plot predictability, and ham-fisted direction combine to make a vacation from reality certain to have you craving home.<br /><br />Among the film's innumerable flaws is the high percentage of "movie jobs," - not to be confused with real jobs that real people pursue.  Everyone has pots of money and works as a journalist, book editor, popular writer, movie trailer editor, movie score composer, hot air balloonist, or itinerant Marcel Marceau impersonator.  Amanda, Cameron Diaz, lives in a house so ostentatious it would embarrass Pablo Escobar.  Those looking for a shred of reality should look elsewhere.  The premise - swapping houses and lives with an absolute stranger - is equally far-fetched.  Though it is an actual practice, it's unlikely to happen at the drop of a hat as it does here.<br /><br />Plenty of eye candy, which helps to make the interminable 135-minutes running time slightly less unforgivable, the English countryside is appealing.  The cast is top shelf, and manages to create some good moments despite the appalling script.  Jude Law is excellent, and Cameron Diaz is not far behind.  Many appealing moments between these two, especially discovering the "Tent."  There is real tenderness and depth in seeing Graham, Law, and his two young daughters with Amanda; Graham is now revealing the entirety of his life to Amanda, and Amanda is finally getting an idea of love as commitment, not merely entertainment.  The Holiday could have used more moments like this.<br /><br />Most puzzling is how the other shoe is never quite dropped, Iris, Kate Winslet, is completely wasted in this film.  She's a pro, and makes the most of what's there, but there ain't much there, there.  If the film had really explored the trading houses/trading lives idea, the Iris story would have to mirror the Amanda story, be just as strong, and intersect with it in surprising ways.  It does none of these things - indeed, Eli Wallach almost shuffles away with the L.A. part of the picture because nothing is happening.  Jack Black is horribly miscast, in fact, just how did Jack Black make it into show business in the first place?<br /><br />Men will dismiss this movie out of hand as sentimental twaddle.  But I like to think that women viewers understand they're being pandered to and will respond by asking, "Does Hollywood really believe we're this shallow?"</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>At first glance this film seemed to be your typical chick flick with a distinctly 'Bridget Jones' feel about it. But as soon as the house swap occurred it very quickly picked up and becomes quite an endearing story. It isn't too heavy, has some fun performances and is an easy way to spend an afternoon. Kate Winslet is great as a heartbroken journalist who befriends an old school Hollywood script writer and Diaz is good as the highly stressed new era Hollywood type who falls in love in low key English surrey. This is a fairly heart warming, innocuous afternoons viewing and although not brilliant, it is a good enough film for those lighter moments. Worth a look as long as you don't expect too much.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Until I was forced to watch this film on my mother's birthday, my favorite movie that included Jack Black in the cast was THE JACKAL ( I particularly liked watching Bruce Willis blowing pieces of him away... ). That changed when I reluctantly found myself drawn into this very likeable, well-acted romantic-comedy. Cameron Diaz was also enjoyable ( another unexpected plus, as the only other film I liked her in was BEING JOHN MALKOVICH ). It is hard to go wrong with Kate Winslet, or Jude Law, but Eli Wallach almost stole the show. This is a real charmer.</p></br></body></html>

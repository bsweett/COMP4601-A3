The future is seen and the guilty punished before the crime has ever been committed. From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Pre-Crime unit, all the evidence to convict--from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details--is seen by "Pre-Cogs," three psychic beings whose visions of murders have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no one works harder for Pre-Crime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. One of his (Steven Spielberg) most compelling and entertaining movies ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Minority Report, I would say, is one of the best science fiction films to be released over the past twenty-five years, and that is certainly no small feat given some of the competing films released over that time-span.  Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller.  In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, `Raiders of the Lost Ark', and `Jaws'.<br /><br />The movies is based on a short story by the late sci-fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the Chief of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia.  What exactly is his job?  To use the unusual psychic abilities of three beings - known as "Pre-Cogs"- it is his job to analyze future crime scenes and prevent murder from happening.  For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problem...John's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow -a man he has never once before met.  On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.<br /><br />What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience.  The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more.  All the characters are found to be believable, as none of them come across as being cardboard, as so many other action films do.<br /><br />Tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his "Average Joe" performances.  By this I mean like in `War of the Worlds' he doesn't come across as being a superhero, as he was in the `Mission Impossible' franchise.  He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world.  Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but symphonize for his loss, because we can believe him.  This isn't a straight-forward "tragic" character, such as Kurt Russell's Colonel O'Neil in `Stargate' (1994).  John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job.  In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him.  It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie.  Special effects have nothing to do with the quality of the human element of the story (sorry, Michael Bay).<br /><br />The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future.  Unlike visions presented in Blade Runner, and to a certain degree Total Recall, this is a very clean, well kept design for the future.  All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip-top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever.  How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.<br /><br />You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made.  For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done.  So, if you want excitement and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as "Transformers," and do yourself a favor: forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AV3JZAYAP7GHC.html">AV3JZAYAP7GHC</a><br/><p>I didn't see this film in theater because of the Tom Cruise over-hype at the time, and I didn't believe that Spielberg could make a truly noir film. (I believe both A.I. and Shindler's List had too much of the Spielberg sugar coating for my taste, and was sure it would present here. I was wrong.)<p>While the ending has a too neat wrap-up common to Spielberg's films, I loved the mystery and the paranoia that he interwove into the story. Like any good thriller, we only know as much as the flawed main character does, and we are drawn into his tortuous journey to discover the truth.<p>Is our hero, Det. Anderton (Cruise), going to commit murder as PreCogs envisioned? Do any of us really have choice if our actions can be foretold? Are there sinister forces behind the controversial PreCog program?<p>And there are scenes that play out like a nightmare -- eerie, surreal, threatening. Just as Anderton thinks he's closer to solving the mystery, Spielberg throws him (and us) into yet another one that must be unraveled.<p>Along the way we are introduced to an entirely believable future vision of a society that has paid a large price for security. A world in which very little is held privately, and even those experiences or memories may not even be true.<p>This film kept me thinking long after it was over. Like I said, the ending was a little too Hollywood, but thankfully Spielberg laid off the sugary stuff to present, on the whole, an intriging and controversial look into our possible future.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Those who choose to give up their freedom to gain security often find that having done so, they have sacrificed the former in vain not to gain the latter.  The dark world of MINORITY REPORT explores this theme in both visuals and in a vision of justice that leaves the term bereft of the meaning with which we usually associate it.  Director Steven Spielberg abandons the sense of wonder that usually accompanies his epics.  In JURASSIC PARK and ET, Spielberg allows his inner child to present a vision of humanity that allows his cast to face danger knowing full well that the danger has a wonder indelibly etched within.  In MINORITY REPORT, however, he harkens back to one of his earliest efforts in DUEL to show how one man can be beset by a sneaky violence totally beyond his power to control or to predict. <p>Tom Cruise, as policeman John Anderton, is a composite of many roles that he has done over a long career.  He is dedicated, action-oriented, smart--and flawed.  When his child is kidnapped and killed, he takes to drugs to forget the pain and guilt that he carries for allowing it to happen.  Immediately after his son's death, a scientist discovers a way to use human precognitive abilities to spot a murder before it happens, thus allowing policemen like him to arrest them, but before the crime actually occurs.  This police state power of course comes into conflict with the ACLU, who in one all too brief scene, argues that it is simply wrong to do that.  During the course of his investigation, Cruise as Anderton, comes too close to the hidden flaw in the entire setup--that the ability of the precogs is not as infallible as trumpeted, and he is set up as one who plans his own murder and thus must be apprehended by his own men.<p>Now there is nothing inherently wrong with taking the basic premise from the story by Philip K. Dick, but Spielberg, in his attempts to imbue his film with a gloominess not present in the story presents a movie that is at once a darkly spectacular treat for the eyes if not a test for the patience of a viewer who soon enough recognizes the oldest of tricks in a detective thriller: the placing of false clues and even more false clues to keep the viewer involved.  As I watched, I tended to overlook the grimness of the photography. Much of the film seems to have been shot with a filter that screened out any color brighter than light tan.  The spectacular car scenes that show Anderton plunging from one vertically placed vehicle to another while at supersonic speeds are a sight to behold.  Then there is the acting of both Cruise and Max von Sydow as the police chief, both of whom bounce off each other at all the right moments.  There is a father-son subtext between them that gives their relationship a resonance not seen since Dustin Hoffman had his molars examined by Sir Lawrence Olivier in MARATHAN MAN.  MINORITY REPORT is the sort of fine science fiction film that thrills the first time one sees it, but I suspect that its witheringly dark grubby underside will prevent one from wishing repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>About the only thing about &quot;Minority Report&quot; that is original is the spiffy effects.  Underneath it all, however, is an oft-used plotline:  Our rugged, honest hero is being set up for a crime he didn't commit (or, in this case, didn't commit YET), and he must go on the run and find out who is framing him and why.  Naturally, as the tried and true formula goes, his betrayer is someone close to him.  And it shouldn't be that hard to figure out the real villain once you've read the cast list or been introduced to the major players in the film.<p>It's just the same meal with a different flavor.  <p>And again, we have Spielberg pouring oodles of time and resources into another whiz-bang effects movie and plenty of extras for a DVD release.  So why can't he devote that kind of time and energy to getting the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy to your local store shelves in a more timely manner?<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; really only impresses visually instead of emotionally.  Even if you get caught up in the story, you can't help but feel the sense of deja-vu.  If you feel you've seen this movie before, you probably have.  But &quot;Minority Report&quot; just makes it LOOK new.<p>As time goes by, this film probably won't be remembered as anything more than a reasonably big Summer 2002 box office effects extravaganza, another &quot;Ooooh, neat!&quot; movie-going experience.  It will be regarded as a really cool movie for a few more months, perhaps, then the next effects-laden thriller will come along to supplant it.<p>Don't get me wrong:  &quot;Minority Report&quot; is a decent movie, I guess.  But don't be swept away by the Flavor-of-the-Month accolades it is getting.  And after the next big Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg movie has its day in the sun, &quot;Minority Report&quot; will seem as exciting as yesterday's news.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; makes for a good 5 day rental from your local video store.  Rent it for all the behind-the-scenes goodies.  But if you purchase it for your home library, it will sit there like an old, forgotten impulse purchase before you know it.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>I will admit to not viewing this willingly:  My best friend is a rabid Tom Cruise fan, and insisted we rent it.  It wasn't bad, but could have used some changes or 'tweaking' to make it more interesting.<p>The use of technical elements was actually pretty cool.  I can actually envision some/most of these gadgets being in use in the not-so-distant future, and it was just cool to see a high tech movie not weighted down by the technese.  The personalized ads were also pretty cool as a plot device.  I did find the eyeball switching to be a bit contrived and a stretch to believe...but it didn't detract from the overall premise too much for me.<p>I do think that, had Spielberg's name not been attached to it, it probably would have registered a little lower on the overall critical scale.  One major problem with this movie is it could have benefitted largely from more editing:  you can lose 20 - 30 minutes of this movie and it would have flowed so much better!!!!<br />It got very draggy at certain points and, under a less-respected director/production team, critics would have made note of this.<p>This is a good movie, but bring your attention span.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Throughout the last 30 years director Steven Spielberg has delivered blockbuster film after blockbuster film, with very few stinkers along the way.  His successful efforts are numerous, some even garnering Academy Awards in varying fields, he's managed to launch many actors and actresses from Hollywood's B-list straight to the top of the A-list, and also launched many of Tinseltown's most lucrative film franchises.  From "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" to "E.T.:  The Extra-Terrestrial", from "Jaws" to the `Indiana Jones' trilogy, all the way up to "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World:  Jurassic Park", Spielberg is a movie-making force to be reckoned with.  With all of these hits under his belt, every once in a while he still suffers the occasional clunker, such as 2001's very expensive "A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence".  Audiences were disappointed with this film, and some wondered if Spielberg really had what it takes from a director to craft a successful futuristic sci-fi thriller.  In response to the public's doubts, Spielberg returned to the realm of sci-fi in 2003 with the smash-hit "Minority Report", successfully laying to rest any doubts and fears movie audiences may have had regarding the veteran director's talents.<br /><br />"Minority Report" takes place in the not-so distant future in Washington D.C., where for 6 years has been completely murder free thanks in no small part to an awesome technology that identifies a killer before the crime is committed.  However, when the chief of the Precrime Unit (Tom Cruise) comes under investigation for a future murder that will occur within 36 hours, he has to fight against time and his co-workers, led by an over-zealous investigator (Colin Farrell), to prove his innocence or fall victim to the seemingly "perfect" justice system he helped to create.<br /><br />With outstanding special effects (rumored at first, to have been taken directly from "A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence", the rumor was later debunked), gripping performances from the entire cast, and once again excellent direction from a critically acclaimed director, it's not surprising that "Minority Report" enjoyed great success at the box office and on DVD.  Roger Ebert summed up the movie best when he said, "It reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place."  I couldn't agree more with Hollywood's portly movie critic, "Minority Report" is one of those few science fiction movies that not only entertains with outstanding special effects, but the story actually makes you ponder certain ideas and notions; such as, is someone truly guilty of a crime they have yet to commit or is there a chance that maybe they intended to commit a crime, but may have not gone through with it, therefore making them innocent?  If that's the case wouldn't arresting that person on intent alone be unjust or merely stopping the inevitable evil that will occur at some point in that person's future life?  Who knows, but it sure makes one think, which is what all movies should aspire to, and what all good movies actually accomplish.<br /><br />This is definitely not a movie to be missed, and should definitely be watched by any sci-fi fan, and if you are a fan of Steven Spielberg but was somewhat disappointed by "A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence", then "Minority Report" is the movie to see, as it will help you to completely forget about that previous failure of Spielberg's.<br /><br />"Minority Report" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>...your future can be changed.  But don't doubt what you may be capable of doing.  This was what I got from this movie.  The idea of being able to identify people who will commit murders is an intriguing one.  What it would be like to live in a city where no murders take place?<br /><br />Minority report is based on another one of Phillip K Dick's novels, a writer who had no technical inclination but great skill for using science fiction to tell very imaginative and human stories.  In this one, the Washington DC police force has a `Pre-Crime' dept, led by John Anderton (Tom Cruise) who can see the most lethal of crimes long before they happen.  This, plus some obvious civil rights twisting, allows them to arrest the person they view performing the murder.  Things are not great as we are introduced to the characters.  Anderton is a good cop, a workaholic who is estranged from his wife because of the death of their son.  He is also a drug user, apparently it is some sort of drug that just makes him forget the world and leaves no trace affects.<br /><br />The big problem comes when John goes into work and sees himself as a murder suspect through the same system that he has used to arrest so many before him.  This creates an obvious dilemma and Anderton is soon on the run, knowing that if he is caught, he will be put in status like everyone else without any sort of trial.<br /><br />Minority report is filled with imagination and explores the deep recessed memories of the characters.  The futuristic world is unlike many others, washed out with bright lights and filled with possible exploits of technology that could very well become real in the future.  Imagine an advertisement board that scans your eye to ID you and then uses your name in the spoken ad.<br /><br />Spielberg makes a huge hit with this movie and makes up gracefully for the abomination that was AI.  This story moves at brisk pace and is chock full of his signature touches.  Cruise does a great job portraying the troubled cop who looses himself in work by day, and does the same with narcotics at night, making it painfully obvious that he is not dealing with his own issues.<br /><br />The movie covers a lot of ground has John discovers the truth as he tries to find out why he would be seen as a murderer to the `Pre-cogs'.  The movie is a thriller of the highest caliber and should not be compared with AI, even though it shares some of its look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>Which is a better film, "Minority Report" or "Blade Runner?" I believe that "Minority Report,"is why, because of the plot. "Blade Runner" focused more on 3D effects than on the human story. What I love about "Blade Runner" is the vision of the future and the settings that were both dark and somber. "Minority Report" is also a dark and yet beautiful film. But I have to give credit to "Metropolis"(1925), the first and best SCI-FI film ever.<br /><br />"Blade Runner," "Dark City," and "The Fifth Element" would have never been created without the inspiration of Fritz Lang's "Metropolis."<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />In The Year 2054, a so-called "pre-crime division" is working busily around Washington, DC. It's purpose is to use the precog(native) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. Author, Dashielle, and Agatha (Samantha Morton), whose power is the strongest of the three. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating in what the police call the Temple, have a vision the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time that it will happen, are given out to these special police who then try to prevent the crime from happening.<br /><br />Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, "Minority Report" is about a cop name John Anderton (Tom Cruise). John has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future murder, and he must investigate the circumstances of this murder and prevent it before it is too late.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****<br /><br />The film examines the political and ethical dilemma of arresting a person before the crime is committed. The project of pre-crime prevention is having it's first trial run, and the citizens of the city will vote on it in the next election. If the people vote it in as law the crime rate will drop drastically, but it is unknown whether innocent people might be imprisoned.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />THE DIRECTING<br /><br />There's a scene that most directors call a two-face-shot but Samantha Morton and Tom Cruise are facing the opposite direction. The two actors chins lay on each other's shoulders, as if almost hugging each other. Then Spielberg takes the camera and places it on the right side of Tom body and captures the two face shot. Tom's face and Samantha's eye's and mouth portray a very powerful scene. Another shot that I call the "Taxi Driver" shot is when Spielberg trails the camera on the roof of the peoples apartment, showing the spiders identifying the people. These days that scene would be digital but Spielberg never uses 3D unless he has too. Spielberg directs his films in a new yet classical way.<br /><br />THE ACTORS<br /><br />Samantha Morton's face conveys total fear and total authority. She received an Oscar nomination for her role as the mute girlfriend in Woody Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown." Tom Cruise didn't get nominated for his breakthrough performance in "Vanilla Sky," shame on the Academy. Tom did receive a Golden Globe for "Magnolia" and 3 Academy Award nominations for the following films, "Born on The Forth of July", "Jerry Maguire" and "Magnolia." Collin Farrell delivers his best performance in this movie to date.<br /><br />There is a mental love story portrayed between Agatha and John. They've both been scarred deeply in the past and fate brings them together at this crucial time in John's life to solve this mystery. The film ends with Agatha sitting in a chair thinking about both her mother and John.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>I am so glad my husband dragged me to see this movie.  From the advertising, it did not look too interesting, although I love action and sci-fi.  Minority Report is magnificent.  One of the most original, thought-provoking, and entertaining movies to come along in twenty years.  This is a true classic.  <p>Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell are wonderful in their roles as Precrime Police, stopping crimes and charging &quot;criminals&quot; even though the crime has not taken place.  The Precrime Police have three empaths who provide them with information.  The empaths are suspended in water solution, and although they are not slaves, have never seen the outside world.  One of the empaths is female.  She is one of the most compelling characters, although she does not say much or get much screen time.  <p>The last scene had a few women in the theater crying.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>For once, the Amazon critics have it right. Tnis movie ranks with Bladerunner, Vanilla Sky, and the underrated A-I. ESPECIALLY Bladerunner (add in Dark City). It has the same impersonal dismal vision of the future.<p>I was never a Tom Cruise fan. He was always the romantic pretty boy. But his last two movies, Vanilla Sky and now Minority Report, have made me a fan. And I have always liked a good Spielberg film. This film is not just a great expo for Spielberg special effects, it is a great thriller a la Hitchcock. <p>Set in 2054, murders are elinated due to `precogs' seeing the future. Max Von Sydow is the head of the Precog corporation (in typical Von Sydow style). Cruise is the Chief of the crew that prevents these murders before they happen, and the movie takes off when he becomes the target of one of these `visions'. He has to overcome incredible odds to prove he wasn't going to commit the murder the precog's predicted.  But, TRUST ME, there is SO much more to the action than this short synopsis. I left it this way on purpose. If I tell all, it will ruin the effect of the movie.<p>About the cinematography...this is a dark film, and the whole movie is shot in near black and white. All the hues are toned down, and this sets the mood for the futuristic attitude (much like M. Night Shaymalan's Unbreakable) showing that there is no individuality. The fururistic vision of personalized advertising via retinal scanning is absolutely scary. I guarantee I will close my eyes in the future...<p>The sound is GREAT (for those of us with DTS). You hear rain drops to the side, and bubbles from the precog tank to the left. Absolutely SUPERB.<p>This is one of the best sci-fi thrillers I have seen this year. Again, this is not just a sci-fi movie. This is an excellent murder mystery not to be ignored.<p>If you have read my reviews in the past, you know I don't review poor films. Trust me, you will want to see this movie. I mean it.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>When you combine the talents of superstar Tom Cruise ("Vanilla Sky", "Top Gun") and director Steven Spielberg ("A.I.", "Jurassic Park"), there's nothing that can stop them from bringing a great film to the big screen, and "Minority Report" is no exception whatsoever! I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it! We have seen Spielberg give us some extraordinary classics, such as "Jaws", "E.T.", the "Indiana Jones" films, and "Jurassic Park", and a questionable film such as "A.I. Artificial Intelligence". But now, Spielberg has certainly outdone himself with "Minority Report", a film loaded with action and thrills galore, powerful drama, and cutting edge special effects that only Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) can provide us with! And as far as the performance from Tom Cruise goes, it was a performance that couldn't be better! Possibly the best Cruise performance since the "Mission: Impossible" films! "Minority Report" takes place in Washington, DC in the year 2054. There is a new brand of law enforcement called the Department of Precrime. Precrime uses psychics called "Pre-Cogs" to help the officers see the perpetrator committing his/her crime and to stop them before it is actually committed. As for Precrime chief John Anderton (Cruise), he is among those that believes in this system being perfect and that it is never wrong...until now! Shockingly, as it turns out, Anderton is being set up for a murder that he didn't even commit! And so begins an action-packed journey as Anderton races against time to clear his name, reclaim his life, and to find out who framed him and why. In closing, "Minority Report" not only has an outstanding performance from Tom Cruise, but an impressive supporting cast including Max Von Sydow ("Judge Dredd"), Colin Farrell ("Hart's War", "American Outlaws"), Samantha Morton ("Sweet and Lowdown"), Kathryn Morris ("The Contender"), Neal McDonough ("Star Trek: First Contact"), Tim Blake Nelson ("O Brother, Where Art Thou"), Jessica Capshaw ("Valentine"), Patrick Kilpatrick ("Free Willy 3"), and Peter Stormare ("Armageddon"). "Minority Report" is, without a doubt, one of the absolute best sci-fi action thrillers ever made since "Blade Runner". This is an absolute DVD must-own to any Steven Spielberg or Tom Cruise collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HS9F7J51E9CB.html">A1HS9F7J51E9CB</a><br/><p>Just what if a foolproof prerecognition system was in place where you could predict who would commit a violent crime before it happened?  This is 2054, and for the past five years, pre-recognition has been test sampled in Washington D.C.  There are three young people who have proved their prophecies are 100% correct among the three of them.  These predictions are flashed upon screens (in a most scientific manner), a wooden ball drops down a chute with the perpetrator's name on it and another with the name of the victim.  The chief of detectives (Tom Cruise) analyzes these scenes (I thought he was conducting an orchestra!) until he has enough information and then using spectacular transportation machines, gets to the crime scene in time to preempt the crime.  The perpetrator is "haloed" and put in some state of suspended animation under guard.  There has not been a murder in D.C. for five years.  Congress is ready to submit a bill to a national referendum to use this method nationwide.<p>The movie opens with a confident, ever-so competent Cruise reporting for duty through the labyrinth of a futuristic paranoia-inducing building.  He quickly gets to work before we are quite aware of what he is doing.  We get a sample of the how and the wherefore of a "precog" arrest.  A wife and her lover are spared being brutally murdered by the enraged husband.  End of task.  The action is loud, quick and overwhelming.  The scenes are shot in the harshest light or in grays and blacks.<p>Then to the crux of the matter.  What if there is a mistake? A detective (Colin Farrell) by order of the Attorney General's office has orders to investigate the whole procedure.  He comes on like a bad guy to high-minded Cruise and mentor Max van Sydow.  But isn't he right?  How can a person be convicted of a crime he didn't commit?  Cruise himself is falsely accused, and the chase begins a la "Fugitive."  At one point, he kidnaps one of the "precogs," powerfully and touchingly played by Samantha Morton, to help him prove his innocence.  <p>"Minority Report" is a long movie (2 hours 20 minutes), but it didn't seem overly long to me.  I was thoroughly engaged trying to keep up with the non-stop action and changing scenes.  It definitely is a Spielberg movie; who else would have you chase your own eyeballs?  I liked the moral questions that were part of the warp and weave of the movie.  The special effects were not overdone and seemed realistic for a movie set 50 years in the future.  Overall, "Minority Report" is about the best I have seen this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I doubt this guy can do any other role. Each time he's the same, and in none of his roles can you differentiate between the characters. I found some points in this movie extremely slow, although it speeded up towards the end, and I got really into it.<br /><br />What I found funny about this movie, was the fact that I didn't recognise Samantha Morton until she came out of her 'bath'. She's got one of those recognisable faces. I had a laugh during the movie, cos I could hear the conversation between her & her agent in my head. It probably went something like this:<br /><br />Agent: I have a role for you Samantha. What you have to do all the time is cling onto Tom Cruise ...<br /><br />Samantha: I'll take it!<br /><br />(pause)<br /><br />Samantha: What's the catch?<br /><br />Agent: You have to shave you head, and when you're not clinging onto Tom, you spend most of your time in a bath.<br /><br />Samantha: Oh ...<br /><br />The rest of the cast include of course Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow, who was one of the priests in The Exorcist.<br /><br />I normally like Colin Farrell in movies - especially in Daredevil, with his Orish accent. But in this, he annoyed the hell out of me! And why? It wasn't because of his funny sounding accent. No, it was because he was constantly chewing gum. His mouth was so distracting, it was like watching a cow chewing cud. And why was this I wonder, the fact there was absolutely no one smoking in the movie?! Apparently, he also had a lot of trouble delivering the line &#34;surely you understand the fundamental questionability of Pre-Crime methodology&#34;.<br /><br />There's quite a few famous cameos in this, mainly in the train scene, so you have to keep your eyes peeled for them. These include: Paul Thomas Anderson (who directed Tom Cruise in Magnolia and it is reported that he is so hard to find that Anderson himself does not know where he appears; Cameron Crowe,  Tom's director from Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky as the guy who looks at Anderton over the top of his newspaper and recognizes him; and Cameron Diaz, Tom's co-star in Vanilla Sky plays the blonde woman sitting just behind the man who looks over at Anderton on the train.<br /><br />The PreCogs I found really interesting, and of course a woman - Samantha Morton - was the main PreCog, the one had intelligence, of course, what else would we expect? Although it's rarely mentioned (I don't remember hearing the male PreCogs names mentioned) the PreCogs&#34; were all named after famous mystery writers. Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon), 'Conan Doyle, Arthur' (Sherlock Holmes), and Agatha Christie (Murder on the Orient Express).<br /><br />What my Dad managed to point out, were the references to Stanley Kubrick movies:<br /><br />--&#62; When Anderton undergoes his eye replacement procedure, his eyes are held open by clamps, reminiscent of the treatment sequences in A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />--&#62; Burgess, (Max von Sydow) is named after author Anthony Burgess, who also wrote about crime control in the future in A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />--&#62; Directly after the opening montage of the husband murdering his wife, it cuts directly to a close-up shot of the &#34;precog&#34; Agatha's eye. The exact same shot is used at the end of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey after the light show.<br /><br />--&#62; When Anderton jumps off the car and through the window, he lands into a yoga classroom. The head of the class is dressed exactly like the rich old woman Alex kills in A Clockwork Orange. Like Alex, Anderton is characterized by his drug abuse and love of classical music.<br /><br />--&#62; When John Anderton and Agatha are running out of the shopping mall, they pass by a homeless man laying in front of the door who asks for change. The vagrant in the tunnel scene in A Clockwork Orange, where Alex and his droogs beat him is reminiscent of this.<br /><br />--&#62; Agatha yelling &#34;murder!&#34; a reference to &#34;redrum!&#34; from Shining, The (1980).<br /><br />and also Bladerunner (both this & Bladerunner were written by Philip K Dick, although in the credits, this is based on a SHORT story by the author):<br /><br />--&#62; Both films begin with an extreme close-up shot of an open eye, and repeat the eye motif throughout.<br /><br />--&#62; Rutger Hauer's character (in Blade Runner) visits the genetic engineer who created his artificial eyes, Tom Cruise's character visits the surgeon who replaces his eyes.<br /><br />--&#62; Both films feature detectives making a key discovery by spotting a woman reflected in the mirror in the background of a crime-scene image that they are looking at.<br /><br />--&#62; Several times, bright shafts of light pour in through the windows behind the characters as they talk; this effect was used extensively in the earlier film.<br /><br />--&#62; After Cruise's encounter with Crowe, he drives with Agatha through a gorgeous green scenery, and tells her they're going &#34;Someplace safe&#34;, a scene which parallels the ending scene of Blade Runner (the original, not the Director's Cut version)<br /><br />--&#62; As Anderton and Agetha leave the shopping mall they pass a woman on the left hand side carrying an umbrella with an integrated light. This appears identical to those carried by the citizens of Los Angeles in Blade Runner when Deckard walks the streets.<br /><br />I haven't seen either of these movies, mainly because A Clockwork Orange freaks me out too much, and we don't have Bladerunner on DVD. I also noticed similarities to the Matrix (mainly just because of those little spider things, when they're looking for Anderton), and Back To The Future, but I suppose it was just all the future stuff.<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie, although there was a lot of talking about nonsense, which simple people will NOT understand. I'd highly recommend it, if you can stand watching Tom & Colin long enough for Samantha to steal the movie away from them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Talk about a action-packed sci-fi with brains, "Minority Report" is an incredible movie that combines sci-fi with elements of film noir.  It's one of those films where you can enjoy it without being the biggest sci-fi enthusiast.  I've admit many times that I'm not the biggest sci-fi buff, but if there's a solid story behind it all, I'm there!  And this film has it all.<p>The movie is set in the future where murder is pre-determined.  That's right, now murders can be stopped before they ever happen.  It's called "Pre-Crime."  It's based on a system involving "Pre-Cogs"  that can see the future and predict when somebody is going to murder someone.  It's supposed to be flawless.  But something goes wrong when the system targets one of their own, Detective John Anderton.  The Pre-Cogs have predicted that he will murder a man that he has never met before.  Now John is on the run, hoping to find out what's going on and if he's been set up, who is behind it all.  The deeper he searches the more twists and secrets come about.<p>Everything about this movie I love.  I love how dark and eerie of a movie it is!  I wasn't expecting that from Spielberg, being that I saw "AI" and thought that while it was a little dark I think he missed an opportunity to get even darker.  "Minority Report" is one of the darkest sci-fi films I have seen in a long time (since "Dark City").  And what I love about it all is that even with out-of-this-world special effects, the movie never loses focus on the story or the characters.<p>The script was absolutely superb.  I've never read the short story that the movie is based upon, but I have to admit I was in awe at every turn.  It has some great acting too.  Tom Cruise was perfect for the role.  Colin Farrell and Max Von Sydow were terrific as well.  Steven Spielberg doesn't miss a note in his directing and I think the movie could've gone wrong if it were in the hands of somebody else.  (I'm just grateful that George Lucas didn't get his hands on this one.)<p>A word of warning; I wouldn't recommend parents letting their little kids see this one.  It gets very dark and disturbing at times.  Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you for a second, I believe that it BARELY made PG-13.  Just a little warning from me.<p>The DVD contains a TON of extras that are bound to keep you happy.  The picture is great (some will complain that it looks all grainy, but that's exactly how it's supposed to look) and the sound is outstanding.  You get the chance to hear it in DTS if your system can play it.  Some of the extras are a bunch of documentaries on the special effects, behind the story and thought, stunts, locations, and a lot more.<p>"Minority Report" is an outstanding film that really does remind me of great dark sci-fi movies like "Blade Runner" and "Dark City."  Combined with action, suspense, drama, and elements of film noir, this movie  proves to be a success on every front.  If you're looking for a great movie, check out "Minority Report" when you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>Based on the short story by popular sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick, this intelligent--and rather ominous--vision of the future is one of Steven Spielberg's finest works, and manages to captivate and stimulate viewers for nearly two-and-a-half hours. The story, too, presents a long-thought-over theoretical conundrum regarding individual independence and self-government vs. fortune that is predestined by a higher power--the eternal battle between religion and evolutionary humanism. More faintly, however, this film probes the mental and technical processes by which criminals plan their crimes and law enforcement pursues the criminals. Shot with an over-exposed lens and a desaturated color palette, Minority Report grows more beautiful with each successive scene, and also entails magnificent special effects of various ultramodern technology and gadgetry (including the ingenious mechanical "spiders").</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>The movie starts out revolving around a drug-addict Tom Cruise is the lead cop on a special type of crime force.  What this squad does is watch crimes happen before they are commited, there are 3 "special" children that can tell the futute.  How the police got their hands on em is a whole nother story.  So there is a new advisor of some sort played by Colin Ferrel, right when he enters the story, Cruise is watching a crime happen so that he can go stop it, but he sees himself committing the crime.  The movie flips the switch here and this is your warning to put your seatbelt on.<br /><br />A great movie by Spielberg where he is at his best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Before filming began, Steven Spielberg created a "think tank" of scientists, physicists etc to basically brainstorm what would the future be like, from transportation to home movies to advertising. It's an eerily real picture, as if someone went into the future and came back and told everyone what he saw. So we have Spielberg's first action blockbuster since the Lost World and it's not in the same category as E.T or Jaws but it's still an entertaining romp.<br /><br />Less than 50 years from now, the Precrime Unit uses the psychic abilities of 3 clairvoyants to determine when someone gets murder so it's up to the police to stop it from happening. But this creates a debate: is someone a murderer if they haven't done it yet? John Anderton believes in its system until he becomes the murderer of someone he's never met. Instead of just getting arrested, he decides to do what they others don't get to do: figure out why he's going to kill him meanwhile being hunted by Precrime's other policemen.<br /><br />It's a future that seems quite possible. Instead of advertisements on TV, electronic scanners scan your eyes than proceed to advertise their products/services and actually address you. Getting on a train gets you scanned. They even have small Spyders which can also scan rather than policemen doing it themselves.<br /><br />Transportation systems have electronic cars magnetized(said in the bonus features) and they can travel up and down buildings. Instead of men building cars, it does it all by itself. These and many more are featured in the film and helped along by Spielberg's think tank.<br /><br />Now for the film itself. It's merely a good movie. It's not awesome like Jaws, or great like Close Encounters, it's merely good. Close Encounters had a 2 and a half hour pacing but never felt it, here it almost feels it(same length). Also while Jaws freaked you out and scared you and Jurassic Park gripped you, this just merely entertains you. It's like it doesn't get you pumped about the action scenes, it's like "ooh an action scene" but you don't get anything afterward.<br /><br />Tom Cruise can be a good actor if he had the right character. Ever see Magnolia? He's actually surprising in that. Sometimes actors think the best way to act is just to have a big serious face the entire film so it looks like you're deep in thought and troubled. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino can just do one facial expression and they say more than a big overracted speech. Tom Cruise kind of pulls it off, getting better as the film continues. The rest do their job but they merely play static characters, providing a certain type of attitude, so you have the estranged and little bitter wife, the "I'm gonna get you" government agent and the father-ly runner of Pre-Crime.<br /><br />If you're thinking of another Spielberg masterpiece think again. But it's close enough and even a near masterpiece is more better watching than the recent fare plaguing movie theatres(I'm looking at you The Pacifier, Monster-in-Law and Shark Boy and Lava Girl)</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>This is a movie that I was unfortunately unable to see at the theaters and regretted it then and even more so now, seeing how great a movie it is.  You can normally expect a Steven Spielberg film to contain; stunning imagery, intense suspense and an overly enthralling film, which he delivers perfectly in this film.  Minority Report is an absolutely riveting film that will have you going from the moment the film starts to the very last second.  Tom Cruise's more recent films really haven't really lived up to expectations, not so in this film.  He seems to be completely in his stride with this role.  He performs brilliantly in this film.  Nods to Max Von Sydow as well.  If you're into action/mystery films with a good dose of Science Fiction tossed in for good measure, this is your film.  Minority Report is a must for your DVD collection!<p>The premise:<p>It is the year 2054 and the film takes place in Washington D. C.  For the past several years, murder is all but a thing of the past.  With the advent of the Pre Crime division, where three pre-cogs, see a murder before it happens.  Tom Cruise plays the chief of the Pre Crimes division, leading the troops in the apprehension of these criminals who haven't, yet are about to commit murder.  His character is plagued by the murder of his son, six years prior and is suffering the emotional damage from that murder.  The pre-cogs, foretell a murder and as Tom Cruise is working his amazing futuristic computer to discover who the murderer is, he finds that it is he who is the murderer.  And so goes the film as he makes his way out of the Pre Crime building and starts on his quest to figure out who has set him up.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Based on P. K. Dick's short story, and blessed by sure-fire duo of director Spielberg and star Tom Crusie, "Minority Report" would fascinate many film fans, but that's not in the same way as "Blade Runner" did.  It's more like "Indiana Jones" in sci-fi area; it is always moving and entertaining, but the dark world that P. K. Dick's world represented is much modified for wider audiences.  But still, "Minority Report" delivers much.<p>The year is 2054.  Tom Cruise is a chief detective Anderton at Department of Precrime, where he and his team are dedicated to their mission; that is, to stop the crimes that have not happened yet.  Helped by three "pre-cogs" floating in the water, they can detect the time, and persons that would be involved in the crime, and hurry to the crime scene.  But what if there's a flaw in the system?  What if the oracle of precogs is wrong, accusing of the wrong person?<p>Anderton, who has a sad memory in the past (which would be revealed later in the film), could shake off the doubt even before the strong argument from the hotshot agent sent by  Department of Justice, Colin Farrell, who obviously does not share Anderton's thought.  But still Anderton believed that he could keep on doing his job in order to elinimate all the crimes from his district ...  until he is made to see something too  unbelievable.<p>I just introduced the opening part of this long film (running time being almost 150 minutes), but you get the drift.  There are great chase scenes, hauntingly realistic picture of the future world, and equally impressive acting from the leading actor Tom Cruise, whose role is not 100% heroic.  But it is Spielberg as gifted storyteller who really stands out, leading us to the end of rather stretched story (and, inevitably, the story is greatly changed from the original).<p>The vision of the future is surely impressive, but if you're looking for the dark images of "Blade Runner", you will be disappointed.  Remember, it is Spielberg, and his previous work "AI", which was once attached to Kubrik, is not a good example of describing the relentlessly cold world.  It is similar to "Total Recall" essentially, only without the graphic violence Arnie and Sharon had to suffer.  But, beware, Tom's character too in fact suffers a very painful scene (oh, eyes).<p>The film presents effective actions, and as I said, its visuals are impeccable, but as you know, Steven sometimes overreaches himself, and he did it again.  To me, those "yoga" and "meat" and, well, as I said "eyes" should have been left in the cutting room.  They are his brand of grotesque "humor", I know that, but they are also all out of tune in the final result.<p>As for Tom Cruise's career, I can say "Minority Report" is the best so far since his film-producing partnership with Paula Wagner started, being much superior to "Mission Impossible" and its sequel.  However, it is also notable that supporting roles are a bit weak and unconvincing, even with the inclusion of Max Von Sidow and Lois Smith.  It may be batural result for our attentions are all supposed to go to the lead Tom himself, and in this case the story requires so.  That is why the conclusion is not as strong as the impressive first half, and even his fans would admit that the latter half of the film need more polishing.  The original idea about detecting future gets lost among the muddled wrap-up, and sometimes you wonder at the film's inconsistency, like; "Why can't they think of this while they can do that?"  <p>But as a whole "Minority Report" is a good work, but not as good as raving reviews of some critics suggest.  I say so, because I like to see good storytelling, and you can find it there, but there is also too incredible moments and plot holes, which are barely covered by the director's great skills.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>Stephen Spielberg's latest sci-fi/action film "Minority Report" is certainly a massive special-effects hit, but great special effects and a superstar actor cannot always compensate for a weakened story and predictability.  The film is based upon the brilliant short-story (of the same name) that was written by Philip K Dick (1928-1982), who also wrote "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?".  Unfortunately, the original story was changed to better accommodate the film's lead actor, Tom Cruise.<p>Set in the U.S. in 2053, Americans have ceded many constitutional freedoms, privacy and protections to a new totalitarian federal agency whose sole purpose is to predict and prevent murders before they happen.  The agency, headed by Director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow), predicts murders by using the skills of three people highly gifted with precognitive extrasensory perception.  The three "precogs" (as they are called) are regarded as being infallible, especially by Tom Cruise's character, John Anderton, who is one of the agency's star detectives. (In the original story, John Anderton was the police commissioner.)  To John's great disbelief, the precogs predict that he will commit a murder of someone that he does not know.  Like anyone else so accused, John runs to avoid the same fate as all other people accused and easily convicted of pre-crime: imprisonment via suspended animation.<p>Much of the film is devoted to John running from pre-crime detectives while he attempts to determine the identity of his supposed victim.  During the high-tech chase (Hollywood sure loves chase scenes), Spielberg highlights many special effects. These included cars that can drive along vertical surfaces and electronic billboards that cater their advertisements to each person after scanning and identifying each from his/her retina.  The billboards enhanced the film's  Orwellian flavor.<p>Minor performances in the film include Lois Smith (who played Kathy in the 1980 film "Resurrection" and Aunt Meg in the 1996 action film "Twister") as Dr. Iris Hineman, a good performance by Samantha Morton as the precog Agatha, and an excellent performce by Peter Stormare as black-market eye surgeon Dr. Solomon Eddie.  Plot twists used in the film's ending scenes (which totally abandoned Philip K. Dick's original ending) were highly reminiscent of an earlier Tom Cruise film, "Mission Impossible".  Tom Cruise's formulaic portrayal of John Anderton was, unfortuneately, typical of many past egocentric characters including Lt. 'Maverick' Mitchell in "Top Gun", Charlie Babbit in "Rain Man", Lt. Kaffee in "A Few Good Men", Mitch McDeere in "The Firm", Jerry in "Jerry Maquire", Frank Mackay in "Magnolia" and Ethan Hunt in "Mission Impossible", to name a few.<p>Though the film is entertaining, it is doubtful that "Minority Report" will attain the same level of respect and appreciation in the sci-fi community as "Blade Runner", which was based upon "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and directed by Ridley Scott  (It would be interesting to see how Ridley Scott would have interpreted Philip K. Dick's short story and who he would have chosen to star in the film.)  With its Orwellian portrayal of the future, morbid humor, cyberpunk sets and great special effects, but less than stellar portrayal of the original story, "Minority Report" earns a reserved 4-star rating.  It also shows that combining a superstar director with a superstar actor doesn't necessarily result in an infallible film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise is a futuristic detective (literally - he solves crimes that haven't occurred yet) in "Minority Report".  It's 2054, and Cruise is Anderton, an emotionally scarred (and substance abusing) detective assigned to an elite detail called "Pre-Crime".  Using human oracles called "Pre-cogs", Anderton receives visual clues to murders that haven't occurred yet - clues of the crime come in disconnected, dreamlike scenes.  The "pre-cogs"- two men and a woman, each ironically named for a famous mystery author - are accidents of nature and the addictions of their mothers.  (Their power is something of a curse: the pre-cogs' life boils down to floating in some sensory deprivation tank while involuntarily channeling repeated episodes of grisly murders).  The pre-cogs are themselves victims of a sort and, being the crucial elements of Pre-Crime, can't expect help from the cops.  It's not clear how the pre-cogs work, but the fact that there are only three of them - and the female "Agatha" is linchpin - implies that Pre-Crime is on shaky ground (aside from the dubious morality of arresting and imprisoning people for crimes they haven't actually committed). Pre-Crime effectively deters premeditated murder (which can be detected up to 4 days ahead of time), leaving Anderton and his crew with crimes of passion which, being spontaneous, are only detected hours (at best) ahead of the fact.  "Pre-Criminals" are given "Halos" - headsets that put them to sleep until they can be placed in a more permanent form of suspended animation (due process, like law enforcement, works ahead of the crime, so that "punishment" is immediate).  <p>Anderton is already in trouble when the story starts - though professionally respected, he's scarred by his son's disappearance years before, an event that wrecked his marriage and turned him into a career hog who jogs through the worst parts of old D.C. and buys his illegal drugs from the homeless and hopeless that stubbornly inhabit the future.  Nevertheless, the Pre-Cogs keep Anderton too preoccupied to dwell on his horrible past.  When Agatha mysteriously beams visions of a long past (and "Pre-Solved" crime) Anderton unwisely digs deeper.  Before he can dig deep enough, the Pre-Cogs get another vision - one of a man nobody has ever heard of losing his life to man nobody in Pre-Crime can forget: Anderton himself.  Now Anderton must run, knowing full well that nobody - once tagged by Pre-Crime - can ever run far or fast enough.  Instead, he tries to stay out long enough to learn how Pre-Cogs work.  Tracking down their mysterious "engineer", Anderton will learn a shocking truth: Pre-Cogs, while never wrong, will, on occasion, disagree.  Because this happens so rarely (tell that to the poor sap who gets haloed anyway) instances of "pre-cog cognitive dissonance" (okay, I made that up) are called "Minority Reports".  Convinced he was set up and that a minority report exists that will clear him, Anderton uses every trick he knows to elude capture and also sneak back into Pre-Crime, the only place he can conceivably find his own minority report.<p>Though visually cool and perfectly starpowered (I don't hate Tom Cruise movies), you can't get past "Minority Report"'s biggest flaw - it's a thriller that doesn't thrill.  The film tries to work like a mystery (the Pre-Cogs don't solve the crimes, only present cryptic clues to those that haven't occurred - old fashioned detective work is still crucial) but frustrates itself.  Nevertheless, the script is stubbornly un-thrilling - piecing together clues before it gives itself a chance to appreciate what the clues are.  Rather than give our hero the tools to solve the crime, the film just tosses the clues together.  The mystery is thus solved less by the intelligence of its characters than its compulsion to fill in its own gaps.  By the time Anderton has confronted his purported victim-to-be, you're more likely to have "pre-cogged" the twist ending yourself.  What's left is too reminiscent of "No Way Out" (man who can implicate those in power is himself implicated in a crime) and, even more unfortunately, the first "Mission Impossible" (Cruise must sneak back to his own headquarters) suffering by comparison to each.  Showing that there's still some Kurbick left over after "A.I." Spielberg liberally sprinkles his story with all sorts of weirdoes meant to herald the end of human civilization: to elude the cops, Anderton has his eyes replaced by a seedy underworld doctor played by Peter Stormare (Hollywood's hardest working character actor); Pre-Crime prisoners are kept in upright coffins and stored in a cross between a prison and a morgue, presided over by a certifiable weirdo who plays a church organ and refers to his inmates as "his flock"; the Pre-Cogs' caretaker evinces an apparently unprofessional interest in Agatha; the Pre-Cogs themselves are the result of their parents' drug addiction.  But these characters do less to advance or detail the plot than merely confirm a dark opinion of humanity (like the guys who ran the "Flesh Fair" in "A.I." or the lawyer who gets chomped in "Jurassic" - they exist only to remind us how much humanity has it coming to them).  If "Minority" doesn't excel as a thriller or sci-fi epic, it's nevertheless immensely satisfying as both.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Based on a short story from Philip K. Dick (whose other short stories had inspired Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Imposter), Steven Spielberg brings us a dark (but not too dark) vision of an all too real future world.  In the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., there is a new police force called PreCrime which apprehends murderers before they commit the crime.  For this method, three "PreCogs" are used to predict the crime thanks to drug induced mutation combined with psychic ability.  PreCrime leader John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes heavily in the system and is the best officer on the force, until the PreCogs predict him as a murderer.  Now, Anderton is on the run while trying to unraval a vast conspiracy that will change everything he believes in.  First off I want to say that this vision of the future is very believeable, and the visual effects are incredible as well.  Spielberg's direction is some of his best here, and next to Schindler's List this is his best directorial effort.  Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as Anderton, and his character development is paced along well.  Great, memorable roles for Max von Sydow, Colin Farrel (who steals many of his scenes with Cruise), and Samantha Morton (who is heartbreakingly tragic as a PreCog Cruise kidnaps) are among many highpoints of Minority Report, and this is without a doubt a new sci-fi classic that will be revered for years.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>If I told you this was a story of an unjustly accused cop, on the run trying to clear himself and uncover a conspiracy, you'd roll your eyes and think, "Not again!" It's one of the oldest plots that exist.<br />Not that it can't be compelling, but you've "been there, done that."<br />This is that story, set in a world we haven't yet seen in film, a tweak on our current age filmed in a bleached out color combo.<br />This totally works. All cylinders firing like mad. Good performances, interesting plot, superb twists and slick but unobtrusive effects.<br />It may put off those who aren't "open" to sci-fi in general, but if that sounds like you, THIS should be one you should at least try out.<br />Go with it, and it'll take you to cool places.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I have to admit, I checked the DVD cover more than once to make sure that this wasn't a film by David Fincher. The nuance and presentation was quite fine, but not as &quot;up&quot; as one would expect from Spielberg (not counting &quot;A.I.&quot;, which was an homage to Kubrick). Regardless, the film is wrought with intrigue not yet imagined, and some great sets. The photography was maybe too &quot;artsy&quot; but was certainly appropriate to the goings-on. The performances were great, with Cruise gaining confidence as the film went on. Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow were customarily fine, and there's a particularly touching performance from Samantha Morton that left me a bit haunted. This film gains momentum, due to excellent editing and very taut direction, as well as a literate script, and the result is an imaginative and exciting adventure, great ecapist fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Minority Report" is Steven Spielberg's second foray into Sci-fi in a row, following last year's "A.I." The famed director made his mark in this genre with "ET" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". Today we have a more mature Spielberg, albeit one still obsessed with gadgets. The themes are darker, more complex, more ambiguous. The wonder the younger, rather naive Spielberg held for technology has turned to suspicion. The earlier films were more accessible and certainly drew larger audiences, but his current work does more to cement his reputation as a master filmmaker, as well as a master of the technology he now cautions us about.<p>"Minority Report" takes place half a century from now. A genetic experiment has created `precogs', a small group of people who can see a murder before it happens. Computers can read their thoughts, and by using these, the government has been able to establish its Pre Crime division. In Washington DC, the murder rate has fallen to virtually zero, and there is a big push to use this program nationwide. Pre Crime's chief detective, John Anderton [Tom Cruise] believes the `precogs' are infallible until the day they give his name as the soon-to-be murderer of a man he's never heard of. What ensues is a thrilling story of a man on the run who is caught up in a web of mystery and deception.<p>There are some flaws in the movie. These include a couple of rather large plot holes, some improbable escapes, and the tendency to have the computer generated special effects make the hero jump higher and fall further than is humanly possible. What a master like Spielberg is able to do it to succeed despite the problems inherent in a project. He is able to add layers which distract, intrigue and challenge us. He can take a present day phenomenon, such as the explosion in media technology, and imagine where it might take us in the future. He can take an ordinary, familiar action hero type and make him memorable. He can make us think while also entertaining us.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>When I realised that Steven Spielberg was going to direct Minority Report, I wondered if he were to direct a predictable & boring action movie, where the main character always triumphed against the baddies.  I started to make assumption that the once great director has gone soft, and that he had run out of ideas of producing & directing great classics that we have had come to watch since toddlers.  Naturally, I went to the cinema with great trepidation.  Anyhow, I wasn't disappointed at all.  Whilst Jurassic Park, ET, Indiana Jones Trilogy were catering more for the family audience, this movie is definitely targeted at a more matured audience.  It entertained and provoked us at the same time by offering gray scenarios, asking questions like how are we to trust the system when it is not necessarily perfect and that there are loopholes to be explored, and how are we to trust the system if the integrity of the enforcers is dubious, to say the least.  In some ways, I am feeling apologetic for Tom Cruise because he can actually act and look good at the same time.  Just hope that this doesn't limit his range somewhat.  Furthermore, for an Oscar veteran, Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell (from Tigerland), even the 'Eugene Young' character from TV series, The Practice, & even the gray hair fellow from 'The Band of Brothers', this movie is well supported.  But the final compliment must go to none other than Steven Spielberg for his vision in creating a grand spectacle of what future might look like.  Lexus is featured prominently in this movie throughout, and one can't help wondering if soft sponsorship occured in this instance.  Highly recommended.  My trust in Steven Spielberg prevails!</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>After watching AI I was truly disappointed in the direction Stephen Spielberg.  Minority Report was a relief.  His time and effort for depicting the future with his weekend think tank with some of the great minds in many different areas made of a convincing movie.  I love how computer enable directors to bring realistic dreams to the movie screen.  The story is just as incredible.  It reminds me of the old Twilight Zones or a great Alfred Hitchcock.  The picture is great on this DVD.  Using a type of desaturation a crisp blue formed.  The special Features found on disc two are amazing. My biggest problem with many DVD's is the lack of cooperation by the director and cast.  Here Stephen Spielberg takes his time to explain his vision along with his other constituents. This is a buy.  You will not be disappointed.  The man delivers again with a breath taking film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I can't say that I was all that thrilled by this film... I was surprised by what a good job Steven Spielberg did directing past Tom Cruise's overstuffed ego, and I thought the dystopian sci-fi future he came up with was kind of interesting, but ultimately this didn't really hang together that well.  The premise of the psychics used by the police state didn't quite make sense, and the run-and-hide phase of the film seemed interminable and choppily paced.  Also: when the super-duper cyberstate turns against you, don't they kind of automatically turn off your access cards and top-security passes?  Why was Cruise's cop character still able to get into restricted areas if they were able to track his every move?  Visually, this had its fine points, but again, I felt like the direction was a little too loose... The gee-whiz scene at hte beginning with Cruise waving his magic VR gloves and making the hi-tech computer images dance goes on way too long; like many things in this film, it could have stood a little tightening up.  I did enjoy Spielberg's small, goofy slapstick moments, though.  It was great to see a big, mega-blockbuster filmmaker still able to pause and take time out for a well-timed gag or two.  This was ok, but it could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>I'm hesitant to even say anything bad about this film.  It's not very often we get true hardcore science fiction films here done with faithfulness, let alone ones that are executed in a revolutionary way.  This film looks like nothing you've ever seen before.  Using high-end film stock & lighting, the best in CGI, and special de-saturation of certain colors, the final result is a breathtaking and near seamless fusion of almost perfect technical moviemaking.  This is a new milestone in what's possible.  The only CGI that stood out was the one guy's missing eyes -- one of the sockets had that certain quality that the cafe owner's face in Attack of the Clones had.  But that is honestly it.  The processing of the film, in particular, has produced a look that is truly awesome!  Philosophically, acting-wise, the story...everything was far beyond my expectations, except for the ending.  Here's the problem: Spielberg's part of that Second Climax Club that loves to rebuild tension at the end.  This is one of the common traits of a Hollywood-ish film, something Spielberg should have been careful to avoid.  To make matters worse, he uses the clich&eacute;d "The Mentor is the Culprit" twist at the end.  The length of dialog exposition required to even relay this information (done over micro cell phones that look like jogging earbuds) makes the final scenes even more sloppy and conventional.  The film drags on just past a perfect end in the story, towards a more convoluted, less profound resolution.  AI had a much more exaggerated case of this problem, albeit also in a far less masterful film.  <p>There were three possible solutions to this: <p>(1) Have Cruise actually shoot the child killer; film over, no conspiracy. This would've been profound and artistically tragic.<p>(2) Have Cruise bring the child killer in; no conspiracy, but he's proven that pre-crime is flawed. This would have satisfied Spielberg's desire to contradict predestination.<p>(3) When I first heard of the film, I thought I knew how Spielberg would do it.  Obviously I was wrong, but my original idea is probably the best.  Since the precogs are hooked up to an imaging/victim-ID system and are themselves setting events in motions, then the big twist should have been that Agatha simply had a stray thought about Cruise committing a crime.  At that same moment she presciently saw a possible sequence of events where predicting the murder thereby caused it; the images of the crime appear on screen & the balls are encoded, thus setting said events in motion. After all, she already knew what he looked like and that he was a pre-crime cop, and everyone has random, uncontrollable stray thoughts from time to time.  It would be totally accidental and illustrative of the circular causality factor the human element introduces into the precognitive equation.  This would have been the most taught, profound, and intellectually satisfying twist possible in such a film.  Apparently I'm the only one who thought of it, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>+++++<br /><br />This intelligent science fiction movie is based on the short story "The Minority Report" (1956) written by Philip K. Dick (1928 to 1982).<br /><br />In the mid-21ST century, murderers are caught before they actually commit the murder.  How is this achieved?  By harnessing the extraordinary power of mutant humans who have the ability of precognition (the perception of an event, murder in the movie's case, before it occurs.)  These mutant humans are called "precogs."<br /><br />The police force utilizes these precogs (there are three) by developing a "Precrime" unit.  This unit is headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) and the director of the unit is Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).  The new system is working well until one day the precogs have a prevision that the Chief himself will commit a murder.  The rest of the movie is about the Chief running from the Precrime unit and trying to find proof of his innocence.<br /><br />Now that you know what the movie is about you might ask why it has such a strange title.  When the three precogs all agree on a prevision of murder, a "majority report" is generated.  If two precogs agree but one disagrees, then a "minority report" is generated.  (It is this minority report that the Chief is after to prove his innocence.)<br /><br />This movie was directed by Steven Spielberg and it shows.  He has taken a short story and effectively expanded it.<br /><br />The special effects showing this future world are fantastic.  However, Spielberg does not let these special effects dominate the movie.<br /><br />There is also good background music and in some scenes, classical music is even used.<br /><br />The acting is well done.  Cruise as the Chief effectively carries the movie while Max Von Sydow gives a good performance as the aging director.<br /><br />Some say that the ending of this movie is not very good.  I disagree.  It portrays what a reasonable, rational society would do.<br /><br />There is only one flaw that I detected in the story.  Once the Chief is declared a future murderer, he shouldn't have access to the Precrime unit's headquarters.  Yet he does!  (It should be noted that I discovered this flaw after the movie was over.  This flaw never occurred to me as I was viewing the movie because I was so absorbed in the story.)<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (single disc edition) is perfect with respect to picture and sound quality.  It has two extras, both of which I found interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like intelligent fast-paced science fiction mystery thrillers, then this is the movie for you!!<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />(2002;  145 min;  widescreen;  24 scenes)<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>I started watching again Minority Report on cable this evening. I've seen it before and have the DVD. My opinion of the movie has gone downhill since seeing it for the first time shortly after it came out on DVD. As a great popcorn flick with pretensions of warnings about power, I suppose it's okay. I've just become very irritated by it because it could have been a first rate film. The whole idea of pre-cogs and pre-crimes is fascinating and scary (thanks to Philip K. Dick), but the execution is just Hollywood. Spielberg's and Cruise's film in my view suffers from three major flaws. The film has an overblown production design. The action sequences are pure Hollywood pandering to the target audience. And Tom Cruise again gives a swaggering, "intense" and essentially meaningless performance. Even with this said, Max von Sydow gives a strong, complex performance and Samantha Morton as the pre-cog Agatha is little short of amazing.<br /><br />There is a first-rate, disturbing and subtle movie lurking within the story, but this version is something of a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Minority Report" is Steven Spielberg's second foray into Sci-fi in a row, following last year's "A.I." The famed director made his mark in this genre with "ET" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". Today we have a more mature Spielberg, albeit one still obsessed with gadgets. The themes are darker, more complex, more ambiguous. The wonder the younger, rather naive Spielberg held for technology has turned to suspicion. The earlier films were more accessible and certainly drew larger audiences, but his current work does more to cement his reputation as a master filmmaker, as well as a master of the technology he now cautions us about.<p>"Minority Report" takes place half a century from now. A genetic experiment has created 'precogs', a small group of people who can see a murder before it happens. Computers can read their thoughts, and by using these, the government has been able to establish its Pre Crime division. In Washington DC, the murder rate has fallen to virtually zero, and there is a big push to use this program nationwide. Pre Crime's chief detective, John Anderton [Tom Cruise] believes the 'precogs' are infallible until the day they give his name as the soon-to-be murderer of a man he's never heard of. What ensues is a thrilling story of a man on the run who is caught up in a web of mystery and deception.<p>There are some flaws in the movie. These include a couple of rather large plot holes, some improbable escapes, and the tendency to have the computer generated special effects make the hero jump higher and fall further than is humanly possible. What a master like Spielberg is able to do it to succeed despite the problems inherent in a project. He is able to add layers which distract, intrigue and challenge us. He can take a present day phenomenon, such as the explosion in media technology, and imagine where it might take us in the future. He can take an ordinary, familiar action hero type and make him memorable. He can make us think while also entertaining us.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Spielberg's second mature science film after "A. I.", "Minority Report", is not only a splendid homage to Philip Dick, the author of the short story "Minority Report", but may also be the best example so far of cyberpunk literature translated into film. Tom Cruise's character, police chief John Anderton, is a classic example of the loner, or drifter, found in many of William Gibson's early cyberpunk short stories and novels, especially the "Cyberpunk" trilogy depicting the dark, gritty world of the "Sprawl". Here, the screenwriters play tribute to Gibson in referring to Washington D. C.'s ghetto as the "Sprawl", and depicting computers and nanotechnology (e. g. the robot spiders) like those described vividly in Gibson's work and those of Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling.<p>Tom Cruise gives the finest performance in his career as John Anderton. It is matched with excellent performances by the young Irish actor Colin Farrell, British actress Samantha Morton, and the venerable Swedish actor Max von Sydow. The supporting cast, featuring the talents of Neal McDonough and Lois Smith among others, is excellent too. John Williams's score for "Minority Report" is as vividly intense as his for "A. I.", and is a far cry musically from those he composed for cinematic blockbusters such as "Jaws", "Jurassic Park" and the "Star Wars" saga.<p>I salute Spielberg for his excellent directing; his first foray into the realm of adult film noir, in the guise of a near future cyberpunk thriller. It is as thrilling a film as the first "Jurassic Park" movie or "Jaws", but easily transcends both with its adult depiction of crime and the meaning of individuality. Without question, this has to be considered as one of the finest films of 2002.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>One cannot doubt that the names Spielberg and Cruise will bring in an audience.  That aside, what will this audience see?  <p>Well, they will find a typical summer flick filled with the ingredients for success: special effects, an easy-to-follow and well-crafted plot, cliffhanger situations, familial bonds (This IS a Spielberg film!), political intrigue, and mysterious characters.<p>What more could you want?<p>John Williams has composed one of his best scores in years, a deft combination of the adventurous and the haunting.<p>As far as the performances are concerned, Cruise, as John Anderton, is appropriately heroic, adept at self-preservation, and fit, figuratively and literally, for the tasks brought upon him. Newcomer Samantha Morton is sympathetic as the individual that holds the key to Cruise's future. However, acting nods must go to two veterans, Max von Sydow and Lois Smith.  <p>Sydow portrays Lamar Burgess, Cruise's mentor and the co-developer of the Precog system.  The actor balances the sincere and the menacing with the talent that only years on the screen can give.  Smith is Lois Hineman, the other half of the development team.  Although her on-screen time is brief, she paints a memorable canvas as she provides Cruise's character with important information that can save his hide.<p>These two performers show that the young have nothin on the "old school playas".</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Science fiction films have always been films that can either be really enjoyable or pretty silly.  This one delivers, fortunately.  Tom Cruise's character is really good and exciting throughout the movie.  Sometimes it may appear like he's not always on his game but by the end of the film you'll agree that his performance was wonderful.  You simply must give Minority Report a serious watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>The first collaboration between superstar actor Tom Cruise and famed director Steven Spielberg seems to be a film of redemption. Both had trouble with their last picture with Tom Cruise's Vanilla Sky not meeting expectations and Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence tanking after a decent opening weekend. Whether this is the case or not, both Spielberg and Cruise had read the short story by Phillip K. Dick and did everything in their power to bring the story to life on the big screen. With such a stellar combination and huge marketing buzz to boast, can anything stop this film from breaking the box office bank? How about a little alien? Surprisingly Spielberg and Cruise's dream child may get upset by a genre of film many believed to be on the oust but only long-term time will tell. For now, Minority Report goes head to head with Disney's Lilo & Stitch in a weekend period many thought would be the calm before the Independence Day storm.<p>The story centers on a man who works for the division of pre-crime for the city of Washington D.C. The division of pre-crime is centered on the visions of the three Pre-Cogs, psychics of sorts that predict murders before they take place. It is up to the cop-like pre-crime division team led by Detective John Anderton to stop these acts before the present catches up with the future. And so far it has proven its worth with the absence of murderous acts in the nation's capitol for over six years. But when a hot shot federal agent comes in to take control of the pre-crime department at a time when the nation will vote on whether pre-crime should be allowed, Detective Anderton begins to notice flaws in the system. When he seen in a vision murdering a man he had never met before, he must find a way to change his future in less then 36 hours. The story for Minority Report is probably one of the best that has come from Hollywood in quite some time and we wouldn't expect less from Steven Spielberg. The plot is very intelligent and proves that the summer doesn't have to be just brain-dead, blow `em up action flicks. The biggest surprise comes from the balanced flow of the film considering this was based on a short story.<p>The cast for Minority Report is put together exceedingly well. Tom Cruise has what could be another Oscar worthy performance as Detective John Anderton. Will he get nominated? Not likely since the movie is opening too far ahead of the nominating process but it doesn't he can't be recognized for it. Cruise expresses a wide range of emotions throughout the picture and fits perfectly into the role. Colin Farrell does a pretty good job in the role of Detective Ed Witwer. The only problem is the way his character is killed off near the end of the picture. It is kind of insulting to the character but this isn't a complaint towards Farrell's performance, just toward the story. And Max Von Sydow gives an absolutely wonderful performance as Director Burgess and works well with Tom Cruise all the way to the very end.<p>Overall, Minority Report keeps the audience guessing and running out breath all the way to the very end. The film is definitely the best suspense thriller in summer 2002 if not the best film of the year. Spielberg truly makes up for the mistakes he made in A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Tom Cruise proves to many disbelievers that he can take on such a difficult project with one of the best directors of all time. Though the film is well put together, there are some things to pick at. That would include the film's 2 hour and 25 minute time length, which seemed too long. Portions of the film seemed to really drag especially as the picture neared the end and could have been cut. Another complaint doesn't exactly involve anything that could have been done but the whole thing with Tom Cruise's eyes seemed too much at times. Some of the jokes involving the eyes got a little annoying and could have been left out of the final print. In the end, though, Minority Report achieves everything it was meant to and more. This could definitely be one of the more mature films of the year and works exceedingly well with that.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>You'll enjoy this stylish blend of sci-fi and film noir if you're willing to suspend your disbelief at the door. Many have decried the illogical holes in Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's otherwise excellent screenplay, but in the end these deficiencies hardly matter. Movies dealing with predestination never answer the big questions effectively - they just use them as the springboard for a story. And "Minority Report" tells a pretty good one, even if it does reveal where it's going too soon and is occasionally marred by Spielberg's trademark mawkishness. Tom Cruise is hugely enjoyable as the frantic John Anderton, and Colin Farrell does a fine job of making you hate Detective Witwer. It looks great, sounds great, holds your attention for all 147 minutes, and will even have you giggling at the spectacular product placements and some unexpected comedy.  It's not a faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story - it's better, although Act 3 does see the writers wandering into Hollywood-ending territory and has Spielberg wrapping things up on a typically optimistic false note. Still, it's refreshing to see a bunch of filmmakers tackling a sci-fi adaptation seriously and successfully while still keeping an eye on the box-office.  If you're going to spend close to $100 million on a sci-fi project - and, let's face it, these days you have to - then you also have to consider the return. The result is a memorable film that strikes a savvy balance between deep thought and commercial appeal. "A.I" flopped because it glorified the former and "The Time Machine" failed by pandering to the latter.  "Minority Report" wisely walks the middle-path.  It won't have enough explosions to thrill die-hard action fans, nor quite enough depth to really please sci-fi devotees.  But for the rest of us, it works.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>"Minority Report" is a must-see movie and perhaps the adult blockbuster of the summer.  It gives Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg a chance to work together, and to redeem themselves after a few missteps.  Cruise, a box office draw in the manner of Tom Hanks, and Harrison Ford,  really needed a winning film after a couple of mistakes with excellent directors  (Cameron Crowe's "Vanilla Sky" and Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut"). I feel he wants the success right now not only financially and artistically, but perhaps to keep up with the superior acting skills of Ms. Kidman.  Because of his appeal, Cruise gets his choice of directors.  Spielberg had been toying with the idea of bringing the science fiction short story of author Philip K. Dick to film, and I think I understand that Cruise added character motivation by supporting the plotline with the addition of a kidnapped child for the main character, a child that colors his decision-making process for the rest of his life.  The loss of this child and his marriage gives Cruise the empathy and humane qualities he needs to deal with Agatha (one of the PreCrime unit's "pre-cogs", see below).The combination of Cruise's confident turn as John Anderton, a detective in the year 2054, and Spielberg's vision and special effects to give the film a chilling landscape of what the future holds.<p>In the future, the problem of wanton homicide has been solved in Washington D.C.  by the creation of a "PreCrime" division.  PreCrime uses a complicated mental/visual process to identify murders before they occur, and give the detectives enough time to locate the scene of the upcoming crime and stop the murder.  As a result of this strategy, premeditated murder almost never happens in D.C., and the unit has managed to stop all the murders that would have occurred due to "crimes of passion" by their quick diagnosis and high-tech tools that deliver them to the site of the crime, in time to stop it.  The film opens with a demonstration of the technique that is so well done, fearlessly led by Cruise, that viewers have few questions of the complicated mechanisms of the process.  How do the murders get predicted?  Mysteriously, three humans with highly trained precognitive powers (The "Pre-cogs"), join mental forces to project and even act out the crimes.  How the criminal justice system handles the pre-cogs, and how it handles the criminals convicted of "premurder" is the most chilling part of the movie.  The viewer is drawn inescapably into a plot to frame Anderton himself for a future murder of a man he doesn't even know. The investigation of his own crime will draw you in and keep you paranoid about the action and the outcome until the film concludes. <p>Cruise is perfect for this film - a film chameleon; he gives us an action hero that is believable and empathetic.  He's not trying for an Oscar here, in this action adventure flick; he's just making the movie work.  His flawed and grieving character is really the only well developed of the movie's many roles - Spielberg correctly lets the astonishing special effects drive the film.  Spielberg also has been seeking redemption.  His "Artificial Intelligence" was a huge disappointment.  Paired with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (who will probably win an Oscar), with whom he has worked successfully in recent years, Spielberg gives us special effects worthy of the Indiana Jones series.  <p> Colin Farrell plays the FBI agent who is Anderton's nemesis (a role originally planned for Matt Damon, who would have been more successful).  The incredible career of Max Von Sydow continues as he has his biggest and best role on the big screen in years.  Von Sydow has, of late, turned to cable television to find the haughty, regal and demanding roles for which he is known ("Citizen X" on HBO, "Solomon", and his turn as a humble Jew in "Nuremburg").  Prior to those, he was appearing with frequency on the big screen but in sleepers like "Druids", the Eurohorror flick, "Sleepless", and the endless "Snow Falling on Cedars".  Von Sydow is impeccable in the role of Anderton's mentor, Director Burgess.  His passion for the PreCrime experiment is exceeded only by Anderton's own passion.  Steve Harris ("The Practice"), Daniel London and Samantha Morton are notable, but perhaps my favorite character role went to Lois Smith, a crusty genius with a greenhouse that will make you lose sleep. You've seen Smith everywhere, and just didn't know it (Helen Hunt's Aunt Meg in Twister, Susan Sarandon's mother in "Dead Man Walking", to name two). Her character, Dr. Iris Hineman, helped Burgess create PreCrime, and it is she who gives Anderton the clue needed to deal with his impending doom.  A  movie that will really hold your interest, potentially a boxoffice and DVD smash!</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>This movie is not science fiction the way I thought of science fiction.  The movie is very suspenseful, and it's action packed.  This movie is about a cop who is dealing with the loss of his son, but trying to be on top of his game in his field.  He is a cop, who can pick out the clues of a crime BEFORE it happens, and stop that crime.  That in itself is an interesting concept.  When Anderton, becomes one of the criminals he is in the fight of his life!!!  Watching this movie you are led to believe one person has framed Anderton, but then you will find out you are wrong.  I was really into this movie, and if you don't have super high expectations, you will find this movie to be a really good one.  I was very impressed.  The precogs were a nice twist in the film.  The other aspect of the movie that grabbed me was "choice".  There is a certain part of the film where choice plays a huge part in the film.  You can make the right choice, or you will make the wrong choice.  How will that choice truly affect your life?  I really liked that philosophical aspect of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Steven Spielberg<br />Cast:  Tom Cruise, Max Von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton.<br />Running Time:  140 minutes.<br />Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.<p>Steven Spielberg is perhaps the only director in the history of film who has the ability to extract almost every human emotion in all of his films, whether its true terror ("Jaws"), utter anguish and despair ("Schindler's List"), absolute awe ("Jurassic Park", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"), pride ("Saving Private Ryan"), laughter ("Hook"), and love ("E.T.").  "Minority Report" is a film that promotes suspicion, and more importantly, how greed can deteriorate the soul.<p>In the year 2054, Tom Cruise stars as a prominent law enforcement agent who has the uncanny ability to envision murders and crimes before they are committed.  Because of agents such as Cruise, the criminal justice system is impeccable and without failure, saving lives and putting those who endanger others into jail.  With the tragic loss of his lover (Samantha Morton), John Anderton (Cruise) feels as though life can get no worse; until he becomes the subject of a pre-cognitive murder that he did not commit.  With an FBI agent (Colin Farrell) only a step behind him, Anderton must come to realize why he has been framed, how he has become a suspect, and who the real killer is.<p>Cruise is dynamite as the heroic officer of "PreCrime", jumping from flying, hovering aircrafts (yes, it is 2004 for crying out loud) and blending a poignant, confounded ingredient to his character that not many others would have pulled off.  Spielberg delivers his most authoritative picture since "Saving Private Ryan", enchanting the audience using superb special effects and a cerebral screenplay based off Philip K. Dick's brilliant short story.  The film can often be superiorly confusing for those who do not follow all of the technological jargon, which may throw many viewers off.  With that shoved aside, this latest Spielberg effort has a little bit of everything.  Not a classic, but not a small, futuristic, step from it.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>The famously talented and crazy Philip K. Dick was sort of an SF Kafka. He was a writer of great power and great paranoia, who used both to question the nature of humanity and of reality itself.<p>It's bloody hard to adapt his stories to the screen, but there have been at least two adaptations that have been wildly successful as movies in their own right: Ridley Scott's _Blade Runner_ and Paul Verhoeven's _Total Recall_. I also think well of Christian Duguay's _Screamers_, although it's not of the quality (or budget) of the other two.<p>I've liked Tom Cruise since about 1988 or so. Before that, he seemed to be stuck playing slick, self-absorbed prettyboy hustlers. As of the excellent _Rain Man_, though, he seemed to be stretching himself, and as of _A Few Good Men_ I was persuaded that the guy had serious acting chops. He's continued since that time with a string of good movies, most of which I've enjoyed. (I especially liked _Vanilla Sky_, a remake of the excellent _Abre los Ojos_. If you've seen one, be sure to see the other sometime.)<p>I've also liked several (though not all) of Steven Spielberg's films. He's a talented director.<p>But I would never, never, never have thought that either one of these guys, let alone _both_ of them, would be involved in a screen adaptation of a Phil Dick short story. Nor would I have predicted that the result of such involvement would be anywhere near as successful as this one is.<p>_Minority Report_ is one of the finest Dick adaptations I've seen. It's very nearly of the quality of _Blade Runner_.<p>(I don't mean that it's necessarily a good translation-to-the-screen of the original story itself. Dick's original stories are all but unfilmable, and to be done 'right' they'd require an approach more like David Cronenberg's in _Naked Lunch_. I mean that it's an excellent motion picture on its own terms that successfully carries over some of the most important 'Dickian' themes and elements.)<p>The cinematography alone is nothing short of mesmerizing. If you like, you can turn down the sound and just _watch the pretty pictures_ for two and a half hours. Every frame is an artfully constructed composition, some of them in colors that may never have existed before.<p>The script is excellent. As I'm sure you know, Cruise plays John Anderton, the head of Washington, D.C.'s experimental Precrime Unit, which uses three precognitives ('precogs') to arrest people for crimes they were _about_ to commit. The script doesn't duck the metaphysical problems with this approach but indeed faces them head-on; that's a large part of both the point and the plot.<p>The cast is also excellent (especially Samantha Morton and Max von Sydow). Even John Williams (of whom I am not normally a huge fan) does a nice job providing a suitable score.<p>I won't tell you anything more on the off-chance that you haven't seen it yet. I'll just say that the thing stays on target all the way through and that some parts of it will haunt your nightmares forever afterward.<p>Naturally the film owes a great deal to _Blade Runner_ for its overall mood, but it's also heavily indebted to Stanley Kubrick's screen adaptation of Anthony Burgess's _A Clockwork Orange_. (I assume there are other viewers out there who caught the significance of the fact that von Sydow's character is named 'Burgess'. If you have Kubrick's film on DVD, pause the newspaper-clipping portion and read the names.)<p>_Very_ nicely executed. I don't normally review films that already have umpty-hundred reviews, but for this one I'm making an exception. If you like Dick and/or chilling near-future-dystopian SF films, you'll like this one even if you expect not to.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Incredible visuals.  Stunning special effects.  Edge-of-your-seat thrills and spills.<p>Yep:  Steven Spielberg, all right.<p>Yet MINORITY REPORT is more glitter than it is gold.  It is an uneven, inconsistent, often incoherent film, set in a future so imposing and Orwellian I'm darn glad I'll never live to see it.  And what on earth was with mainframe computers being controlled by dramatic hand gestures?  The future looks solid for all you budding musical conductors out there.<p>The premise of the film on its face is illegal and unethical:  arrest someone before he or she commits a crime--a crime as foretold by three troubled clairvoyants floating in water.  At least I appreciated the discourse--however brief--between the advocates of Washington, D.C.'s "Precrime Division" and a concerned FBI investigator (Colin Farrell) regarding the feasibility of metaphysical crime prevention.  It was interesting stuff, then promptly discarded for the next chase scene.<p>Tom Cruise, as usual, is solid as Precrime Detective John Anderton, an enthusiastic proponent of hauling people away before they commit murder until he himself is the target of a relentless manhunt by his former colleagues.  Max von Sydow as Precrime Director Lamar Burgess looks exactly like the aging priest he played in "The Exorcist" thirty years ago (that was all I could think about as I watched him).  Sure, there's plenty of heart-pounding action, and Spielberg also throws in a few gross video wedgies to make us recoil uncomfortably, yet MINORITY REPORT falls short of effective storytelling, and even dissolves into a contrived, constipated ending.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I can't believe some of the bad reviews for this film.  Yes, just about any film that explores time, time travel, the future, etc. is going to have flaws in logic.  It is impossible to travel through time, change the future, etc.  If you think about it too much, you can always come up with a flaw.  If the flaws require deep thought and don't just leap at you as obvious, I have no problem suspending my disbelief and going with where the storyteller wants to take me.<p>Spielberg tells a great story here. I won't rehash the plot, but let's just say that not only is the story a zinger, but there are lots of great scenes.  My favorite was the scene when Cruise is hiding out in a VERY sleazy apartment, waiting for his transplanted eyes to heal, and the cops release these electronic "spiders" that can get into just about any place and then they find people and scan their retinas.  The sweeping camera work, as though the whole complex had been cut into a cross section, was absolutely terrific.  In about two minutes, we get the entire social / political climate that now exists in this country at the time of the movie, at least for the poor.  And it is suspenseful.<p>The empaths are very creep creations, lying in their pool forever and ever. When Cruise awakens and steals one of them, the movie takes a very interesting turn, as we see the world through the eyes of this empath, Agatha, who has a hard time telling if what she is seeing is the present or the future.  Samantha Morton plays her, and she DESERVES AN OSCAR NOMINATION, ASAP!  She is reviting.<p>Colin Farrell makes for a cool adversary for the hot-tempered Cruise.  Max VonSydow is terrific as Cruise's mentor...he has such a great voice.  And Cruise, who has never been one of my favorite actors, is very good in this...one of his best.  He keeps himself from overacting in most scenes, and doesn't seem too self-conscious about looking good or charming.  <p>The whole vision of a not too distant future, coupled with some great scenes of suspense, good performances and even a tear-jerking moment or two make this one of the best movies of the year, and certainly the best sci-fi of the year.  I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>Minority report is one of the my favorit movie. and at the right moment I bought at an economical price considering I already have the previous DVD editions.<br />contains 2 discs between the film and features. unfortunately I can not slip the cover on this issue.<br />transfer pictures on minority blu-ray is pretty good I just think there might be even better improvements. soft color depth of black in it was amazing. only there are some scenes I feel need to be polished a little better because different versions of dvdnya.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>What if you could stop a crime before it was ever created ?

Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, a police captain who works for the &quot;Precrime&quot; division of the police department in Washingto D.C. in the year 2054. Because of the Precrime experiment/department, there has not been one murder in D.C. in six years. Three humans who are kept in liquid called &quot;precogs&quot; have visions of crimes that are about to happen. Anderton and his collegues then use that information to prevent murders all over the city. This procedure seems foolproof until Anderton realizes that he is next in line to murder someone. The tables turn.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; is a futuristic film that doesn't bore you with a lot of scientific jargon or far-fetched ideas. The thought of murders being prevented alone draws you into this film. Steven Spielberg does an excellent job of showing a futuristic Washington D.C. without it looking fake and silly. The story will also keep you glued. There is the obvious story of the precrime division, a backstory regarding Anderton's son who was kidnapped and has been missing for the past 6 years, and the story of Anderton trying to figure out why he is going to kill someone he has never met. Believe me, this movie will keep you glued to the screen!<p>I would highly recommend this film. Not only is is visually interesting, but the story and performances are incredible!</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise "John"  sees dead people. But only BEFORE they are murdered, with the help of three seemingly vegatative precognitives. When John's precogs see into the future and predict HE will become a murderer, John finds himself the target of his own police force. Can John prove his own innocence, or is he destined to become a murderer?<p>I really enjoyed Minority Report. But I felt the plot was fairly predictable, and the ending was very contrived. I found it hard to believe that a seemingly somnambulant precog female was able to speak, talk, and interpret the sensory feedback she received after being contained within the 'temple' for quite so long. Also, the security was pretty lousy at the police station if John (a wanted fugitive) could so easily break in. *Sighs*<p>Personally, I was much more interested in how the precogs would adapt to the events AFTER the story, than in viewing the fourth quarter of this film. Overall, while I enjoyed Minority, it had almost zero re-watch value. I give it 3.5 stars. I've seen more involved plots on the Twilight Zone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Spielberg's "Minority Report" is a riviting roller coaster ride.  The DVD version with the extra disc shows how much care and thought went into developing each shot sequence.  Spielberg hired a team of futurists to help project what might be the reality in 2054 when this film is set.  As a result, we have magnetic cars that can climb up the sides of buildings and park right next to your living room.  Tom Cruise does a good job of working as the precrime director, until the precogs detail that he will commit a murder.  The supporting roles are well done.  Samantha Morton who was in Woody Allen's "Sweet & Lowdown" with Sean Penn does an excellent job as the elf-like precog Agatha whose "minority report" regarding the death of her mother is the trigger to make the plot spin apart.  TV stars have great supporting parts as "The Practice" has both Steve Harris and Spielberg's stepdaughter Jessica Capshaw as crime cops as well as Boomtown's Neal McDonough.  Colin Farrell who blew me away in "Phone Booth" does a great American accent as Danny Witwer.  Kathryn Morris has a multi-leveled role as Cruise's wife.  Lois Smith who was Aunt Meg in "Twister" does a spooky job as Dr. Iris Hineman; although why she kisses Cruise on the lips remained a mystery to me.  Max von Sydow's Lamar Burgess is brooding and deceiptful.  Philip K. Dick's short story brings interesting themes about personal privacy, identity theft and intrusion into our homes to the fore which make this a film with issues that affect us in the present.  Spielberg attempted a film noir style which he achieved with the stark cinematography.  Hearing the detail of air boosters the cops wore to fly makes you appreciate the complexity of the staging.  My impression is that this is an Alfred Hitchcock-style thriller set in the future with a high-tech film noir look.  This is a great rainy day film to have in your collection.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EAI4948TW53X.html">A2EAI4948TW53X</a><br/><p>Forget MI2, this is the Cruise movie you want to see.  It's long, but the story gets deeper and deeper as you go right up to a surprise ending.  My only complaint is this is like the millionth movie in the last year with Colin Farrell.  Enough is enough with him, he's not that good of an actor but he's been in WAY WAY WAY to many movies lately.  Anyway, back to minority report.  Very cool special effects.  Great story.  You won't be dissapointed.  Everyone runs!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Why is Steven Speilberg so insistant in using the "Bleach-Bypass" color processing in his films.  Minority Report would have been alot better with just normal colors.  The use of dark shadows can be very effective to create a cold and dampy feeling, and it can be done with normal colors and rich black & white, i.e. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CMJSU">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset DVD</a> (1972) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> (1941).  I am not a Tom Cruise fan at all, bit I sure do enjoy Colin Farrell being in this film.  Thanks to this DVD company for offering this DVD in Full Screen and Wide Screen.  I will watch and buy full-screen anytime. I wish film makers would stop using the "Bleach-Bypass" color in films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>Here's the story: A woman who sees the future, predicts that Cruise will commit murder, so he escapes capture from the cops and attempts to find this man he is suppose to murder.

He is also trying to find the where-abouts of his 10 year-old son who was kidnapped ten years prior.<br />This movie has a lot of suspense. The story held my attention from beginning to end. There is also a few scenes with great special effects. In my opinion, this is Tom Cruise's best film. Its much better than Impossible Mission 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise stars in this sci-fi thriller as the captain of a Pre-crime unit where precogs, beings who can see future murders, warn the unit as to what is about to happen, so they can prevent the murder from occurring.

Matters become more complicated when Cruise's character appears in the precog's thoughts of a future murder which he will commit.  His own unit turns against him and tries to capture him.  Using some clever tricks Cruise eludes them, and discovers that he is being set up, but he doesn't know who is targeting him.  The movie is set in 2054 and so it contains a lot of clever technology and special effects.

He had been producer of so many films, some of which he had hardly anything to do with, that I wondered if he still had it. This movie shows that he does. Some imperfections and a little long, but generally a very good show. Some of the ideas and effects seem derived from &quot;The Matrix&quot;, but in a good way and not too obvious. A good cross between action, drama and suspense and worth viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is the most satisfying blockbuster film that I have seen in a long, long time. In my opinion, this is not just the best major release of the year so far, but the best film Steven Spielberg has made in a long time, and maybe ever. <p>In my opininon, this is also the best Sci-fi film since BLADE RUNNER. It could have been even better, but the last twenty or so minutes of the film just aren't as outstanding as the rest of the film. It isn't that the ending is bad; it just doesn't stay at the exhilarating level of the rest of the film.<p>There are just so many great things about this movie it is hard to focus on even a few. I'll try.<p>First, the film is visually stunning. I don't know if the cinematographer used a filter to give the film a grainy texture or if they did something to the film in developing it (it was filmed in Technicolor using Panavision Lenses, so it was not filmed using digital), but the film has a washed out, grainy look that is just perfect. There is a lot of computer animation, and tons of special effects, but they never detract from the film, and always seem to enhance the story. The sets are great, and it provides the best vision of what the future might look like since BLADE RUNNER. <p>Second, the imagined technological changes in the future are really compelling. The film shows everyone getting frequent eye scans, say by cameras over advertisements, which enable the ads to pitch their products directly to the person in question. Eye scanning plays a major role in the film, and leads to several of its best moments, both tense, scary scenes, and in funny, tension-breaking moments. There are some great shots with mechanical spiders that run through a building (one of the best sets I have seen in quite a while, with a lot of sky lights that allow you to view much of the action from overhead). One of the best moments in the film occurs when Tom Cruise is trying to avoid these spiders by immersing himself in a tub of ice.<p>Third, while I know Tom Cruise is not popular with most guys (including me), he is very good in this one. I have to say, this has to be my favorite Tom Cruise flick, by far. Most of the actors were quite good. Spielberg has sometimes had problems in the past casting the best people for key roles, but that wasn't a problem at all in this film. Colin Farrell was very good as an operative for the US Attorney General, and most of the actors in the Pre-Crime division were very compelling. But the best person besides Cruise was, by far, Samantha Morton as Agatha, the most talented and important of the three Pre-Cognitives who anticipate the murders that will be committed in the future. She provides a very large number of the most intense moments in the film, and some chase scenes that take place with her are just incredible. There is one moment in particular when she stops what she is saying in a subdued voice suddently to scream "Run!" that is one of the best moments in the film (don't worry, you won't be able to anticipate when she yells it). The Swedish actor Peter Stomare (who played the insane murderer in FARGO, one of the "nihilists" in THE BIG LEBOWKSI, and the abusive husband in CHOLOLAT, among other roles) has an especially nice if small role as a shady surgeon.<p>This film is so different from Spielberg's other films that if you didn't already know he was the director, you wouldn't be able to tell from watching it. It is bleak, metaphysical, inventive, exciting, provocative, philosophical, and entertaining. A good deal of this derives from the story by the always brilliant though consistently unpolished work of Philip K. Dick, who provides a moral and metaphysical complexity usually missing from Spielberg's universe. The only weak link in the film is when the film transitions from a metaphysical conundrum to a whodunit. Like I hinted above, it doesn't become a bad film; it just ceases to be one of the best films ever made. Had the ending been as strong as the rest of it, it might have laid claim to be the best Sci-fi film of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This movie has all the makings of a classic.  Great Sci-Fi with a turn the tables story that is compelling and engaging.  Just enough in the way of special effects as to not detract from the story but to convey a future of both optimism and the terror associated with too much trust in technology and human institutions.<br /><br />In all, great storytelling!</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>If not for Fox's 24 (yes, the television series), Minority Report would probably be my choice for (so far) the best thriller of the decade.  Pretty hefty statement, I realize, but Minority Report's a pretty hefty movie, one that plays as an innovative mix of futuristic sci-fi and film-noir.  And I'm a little surprised nobody prior to Steven Spielberg has tried for for a similar formula (cases have been made for Blade Runner and Dark City, though I can't entirely agree).  <p>Minority Report is set in the year 2054, a future that, outside of the roads and constant eye-scans, still visually resembles the present (or the past, in this movie's case). Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, one of the heads of Pre-Crime, a division in Washington, D.C. that has the ability to stop murders before they happen, thanks to the work of three Pre-Cogs, psychics (two male and one female) permanently placed in a watery bath, delivering info about the future to the Pre-Crime division (just how it's done is revealed in a very clever and tense opening sequence).  <p>Anyway, there's a debate over whether or not Pre-Crime should go national, and it's something that the people are going to vote on.  The creator of this division, Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is a bit wary of the FBI agent (Colin Farrell) sent to investigate the way the division operates and the possible infallibilities.  <p>Anderton himself has a bit of a mess in his personal life.  He lost his son six years ago, is divorced, and is addicted to illegal drugs.  But matters grow even worse when the Pre-Cogs' latest vision displays a pre-meditated murder (unsurprisingly stated as a rarity in D.C.) and the killer happens to be Anderton himself!  Going on the run, Anderton struggles to escape his old teammates and discover the truth behind this vision; is it a mistake or a genuine view of a nightmarish destiny?<p>First off, let me say hats off to Steven Spielberg.  The man's always had unfounded criticism tossed at him with virtually every film he's ever made.  It's nice to see he's never dissuaded (or influenced) by such complaints, he's a filmmaker who's always crafted his films with a touch of confidence and genuine emotion that few directors could even hope to achieve in decades worth of work (in case you can't tell, I'm a Spielberg fan, meaning I've just incurred the wrath of David Lynch lovers).  <p>Spielberg's work here is, right off the bat, much unlike anything I've ever seen him do.  Sure, there was A.I., but not a segment in that film resembled Minority Report's opening scenes, a montage of quick-cuts awash in blue colors that builds in both violence and intensity, in spite of the fact this sequence moves backward (meaning the violent act is committed first, then we see what led up to it).  The segment ends with a close-up of an eye, with the camera pulling back to reveal a woman lying in a pool, ominously stating the word, "murder."  It's a chilling, daring intro that holds a lot of promise, and instead of disappointing, the rest of the film actually manages to improve upon it.  <p>The future that Spielberg presents here is entirely believable, from both a societal and technological viewpoint.  Most interestingly, when I first saw the previews, I'd expected a "Big Brother" type society akin to 1984, one in which the government monitored all the actions of the people.  But that's not the case here.  The government presented here questions the ethics and logic behind Pre-Crime because if this were reality, it's a subject matter of serious concern, and not just hive-minded behavior and blather about how this is good for "everybody."  Finally, we get a film that features a dark view of the future, but simultaneously gives us reasonable, intelligent characters that realize there are pros and cons to everything.<p>On a dramatic level, Minority Report delivers with as much resonance as A.I., and maybe even better when you factor in just how coherently and cleverly Spielberg and the writers tie all the subplots together.  The emotional baggage is handled mostly by Tom Cruise, who does quite an admirable job; maybe that's an understatement, like the man or not, he delivers one of the best performances I've seen all year.  No one else except for maybe Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton, comes close to Cruise's powerhouse performance, not even Max Von Sydow.  <p>Plot-wise, the film is on solid ground with a few admittedly major stumbles.  One of the movie's narrative burners is the move to make Pre-Crime national, which when you consider the logistics, is almost impossible (3 pre-cogs, an entire country, the cops have to decipher the location through the visual clues; let's face it, you'd need thousands of pre-cogs to pull it off).  (Major spoiler here) The film's big plot twist, while fairly surprising and thought-provoking, doesn't completely hold water.  It's a nice, well-done time loop, but if you consider what happens, then by that basis, I'd suspect a LOT of people could just as easily be accused of murder on such thing ground.  <p>Whether or not Minority Report would appeal to the traditional summer crowd is a little iffy.  There's not a whole lot of action (though the jetpack chase/car factory fight is the most hectic, exciting action scene I've seen all year), the story requires undivided attention (and maybe even a repeat viewing to gather in all the themes), and the downbeat tone, almost pessimistic tone will throw a lot of viewers off.  But for those who do get caught up in this twisty tale (and that should apply to most people), Minority Report offers a lot of rewards, more than you could reasonably expect from a big-budget blockbuster. <p>A lot of people see Minority Report as a warning for how far technology could go and bite us back.  While such a statement works to an extent for A.I., Report is mostly about morals, accepted ethics, and an intriguing look on just how far people are willing to go for their own survival in this "winner takes all" society.  As far as science fiction goes, the genre hasn't been this damned smart and thought-provoking since Dark City.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Minority Report combines an elaborate plot you can never really pin down until the very end, loads of summer blockbuster-type action, all sorts of nifty futuristic technologies and special effects, the star power of Tom Cruise, and the direction of Steven Spielberg.  Given all that, this movie was virtually guaranteed to please audiences, and it does not disappoint.  While the plot is loosely adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick (who truly belongs in the upper echelon of science fiction writers but is still vastly underappreciated), it does manage to embody much of the sociopolitical questions and concerns related to technological advancement that animated Dick's body of work.  In the world of Minority Report, set in 2054, privacy has basically disappeared.  Retinal scans trace your every move, your mind is constantly bombarded by customized advertising (it's like having your brain infected by unlimited and infinitely invasive spyware programs), and you can be arrested and put away (in a comatose cocoon) for a crime you did not commit - if you live in Washington, D.C., at least.  The experimental precrime unit set up in the nation's capitol six year ago quickly reduced the murder rate to zero, employing a trio of exceptional young people gifted (or cursed, depending on which way you look at it) with an uncanny ability to see murders before they happen - thanks to the milky liquid they lie in, their prevision powers are significantly boosted and translated into electrical data the precrime authorities can view themselves.  Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, and he interprets the signals of the precognitives' visions in order to locate and stop each impending murder before it can happen.  Things are going very well - until the federal government sticks their noses into things.  A national referendum will soon decide whether precrime will be adopted nationwide, and Anderton finds himself having to deal with an annoying little runt from the Attorney General's office - Danny Witwer, played by a silly-mustachioed Colin Farrel.  Anderton and his boss, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) do not want their project turned over to the feds, but things get unimaginably complicated when the precognitives identify Anderton himself as a soon-to-be murderer.  Anderton runs, anxious to prove his innocence and desperately anxious to understand what is going on.  Convinced he would never murder anyone (especially a predicted victim he has never even heard of), he has to face the troubling fact that the precognitives are never wrong.  His friends and coworkers now face the unusual task of going after one of their own, and Anderton proves himself quite difficult to catch.<br /><br />I thought the ending of the movie was superb; in many ways, Minority Report is a mystery, and the film plays its cards pretty close to the vest up until the final few scenes.  If you like action and dazzling special effects, you'll find that here in spades, but those who crave an intelligent story behind all the bells and whistles will be doubly pleased by this film.  Apart from the heart of the story itself, Minority Report provides food for thought that you may still be chewing on days later - e.g., the whole privacy issue and the Constitutional implications that, while not really addressed in the film, come across loud and clear; then there's the whole matter of the isolated precognitives, three young people denied a real life in the outside world and forced to live and relive horrifying previsions of murders day in and day out.  Tom Cruise turns in another sterling performance, and his character is remarkably human and complex, as the loss of his son six years earlier and the problems he continues to have adjusting to that loss make of him an incredibly human type of hero.  I should also mention the fact that the film boasts several very funny scenes, serving to release the viewer's tension momentarily - that's a good thing because things get pretty tense as the story progresses and you'll want to be mentally ready for the twists waiting for you around the final few bends.<br /><br />The movie itself runs almost two and a half hours, and a second disc features an impressive number of featurettes examining the origins of this first Cruise-Spielberg project, the making of the film, and somewhat technical looks at the special effects that bring the world of 2054 to vivid life on the screen.  This all adds up to a DVD that will appeal to almost everyone out there who enjoys good movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>It seems contradictory to use the words &quot;blockbuster movie&quot; and &quot;intelligent story&quot; in the same sentence, mostly because the big budget movies that fill the summer season's screens lack any kind of real depth and instead feature dazzling special effects and characters that are dazzling, but completely unbelievable.  So it is interesting to note that, while &quot;Minority Report&quot; dazzles the audience with a future that is slick, cold and high-tech, it also delivers a story that is engaging, challenging and even thought-provoking.<p>Set in the year 2054, &quot;Minority Report&quot; is the story of a new form of law enforcement, an agency called &quot;Pre-Crime&quot; that uses pre-cognative telepaths to hone in on murder victims and murderers before the actual crime takes place.  By forseeing the future, these officers can prevent murders from occurring.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) heads up this department until the pre-cognatives have a vision that depicts Anderton committing the act of murder.  <p>Anderton, confused by the vision, and desperate to clear his name, runs and goes into hiding until he can figure out the meaning of a vision that one of the precognatives shares with him that somehow has to do with his own future actions.<p>Confused?<p>I was too, initially.  The movie, which is far more intricate than my synopsis above suggests, is not a film to be viewed casually.  If you are looking for mindless entertainment, this is not the film for you.  Instead, this film builds layer upon layer, with complex and interesting dialogue between completely developed and believable characters.<p>Anderton, who became an officer of &quot;Pre-Crime&quot; did so because his son was abducted from him, and much of the story surrounds not only the physical events that are occuring to him, but also the emotional impact and ramifications that one, single event had, and how it changed him forever.  Mixed up in a conspiracy that reaches to the very heart of &quot;Pre-Crime&quot;, Anderton must deal with his own guilt, anguish and fear, while trying to determine the cause of the actions that are playing out, leading up to the murder he will ultimately commit.<p>The movie has a very cold look to it.  Spielberg, whose films are known globally, took a very definite approach to this film.  The colors are drab, done largely in blues and greys, and the film itself has a very grainy feel.  The camera work too is shaky, consistent with the type of footage seen in documentaries and shows like &quot;COPS&quot;, giving the film a gritty and dismal look that is far from the glossy images so commonly seen in Spielberg's works.<p>The soundtrack, by John Williams, whose music is heard in most of Spielberg's films, provides a soundtrack that is erie, haunting, beautiful and dark, again, adding a dimension to the stories abysmal feeling.  <p>The action sequences are elaborate, and the effects first rate.  So many films today, especially those that rely heavily on CG animation, tend to look animated, artificial.  The world created here by Industrial Light and Magic is completely convincing, and the effects blend beautifully into the film, even with the grainy look that was achieved by Spielberg while shooting.<p>As a whole, this is a complex, intelligent thriller, with a storyline that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.  I think that the primary reason this film didn't achieve larger success in the theaters was its marketability compared to many of the other films that were being released at the same time.  Because of the darker tones, this film is not for everyone, but it is definitely a worthwhile experience, and a film that should be viewed multiple times to attain the full experience of the story Spielberg has created.<p>Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A2YXMN40D7WTGP.html">A2YXMN40D7WTGP</a><br/><p>I critized movies such as Spiderman and Star Wars for having SFX that were too perfect, too shiny, making them look unreal. Minority report does not fall into this category. In fact the SFX in this movie is so good, people were amazed with what they saw on the screen. Of course, these are the same audiences that would like to see these SFX in action, rather in servitude to the movie plot and concept.<br /><br />In Washington DC, circa 2054, murder is wiped out because of a special division called the pre-crime unit that uses "pre-cogs" to see murders between 30 minutes to 4 days before they happen. It is a criminal experiment that is straight out of Orwells paranoid 1984, but it is successful enough to warrant a nationwide program. The head of the DC division is Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and it is led on the street by Detective John Anderton (Cruise). Anderton, (who falls under 2 standard movie rules 1. Ambition comes from personal tragedy and 2. Cannot have a girlfriend or wife because there is a possibility that he will get back together with an ex.) is possibly framed for the future murder of a person who he has never met and for most of the middle portion, he set out to prove his innocence. He is hunted by a Detective Ed Witwer, a DOJ investigator who has come to audit the program and becomes involved in this developing criminal case, as well as the members of his squad, led by Officer Fletcher (Neal McDonough). As he investigates the case further, he uncovers a conspiracy that may unravel the whole program.<br /><br />The movie is was filmed in the same washed out colors that he and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski used in the battle scene from Saving Private Ryan and parts of AI. It is an indicator that the future will be bleak and disparate, not surprising, since it was written by pessimist Philip Dick (Blade Runner) as a short story long ago. However, this type of estoteric sci-fi, which tackles current issues such as privacy and sacrificing people for the good of society is handled well by Spielberg and his screenwriters. The premise of the movie itself is fascinating, even though it is highly unlikely, but can be slow at moments. A few people walked out of the movie mid way through, probably because they were expecting MIB II. There was lots of visual eye candy that served the story and the plot, but it was not overly done and the things that appear on the screen looked so vivid, that it looked real. One example is Tom's magnetic car which pulls up to his home, the hover transport that drops the troops into location and the cops in backpack jet packs. Spielberg's commitment to detail should be commended.<br /><br />I did not like the ending of this movie that much. You knew that Cruise would get back together with his wife, you knew who was behind the crime. The whole scene involving Sydow's setup was a little too perfect for me. I was also sorting of hoping that Tom and Agatha would hook up instead.<br /><br />There is also a abundance of product placement, from USA Today, to Lexus to the Gap. Even scarier is the concept of "personalized advertising" and the fact that there are eye scanners everywhere.<br /><br />The acting was good overall. Stand outs were Colin Farrell as the worth adversary, Samantha Morton as Agatha, the shivering pre-cog and Cruise, who gets the thankless role of being the straight man. Max Von Sydow, who blew away years ago in the Exorcist and The Seventh Seal plays the role in which he is becoming typecast in. I won't reveal it, but if you watch alot of his movies, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />There were consistencies I didn't like. One major one was Tom's eyes. How come they didn't change the retina codes to block out his eyes? How come he didn't go blind when he took off his bandages 6 hours early? Why didn't Anderton prove his innocence by not committing the murder? What was the purpose of setting Anderton up? How come the pre-cog couldn't figure out the murder of Anne Lively?<br /><br />These inconsistencies do not take away from the sheer entertainment value of this movie, both as a Summer blockbuster DVD as well as a thought provoking film about where our society is possibly heading....Rating: B</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q.html">A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q</a><br/><p>It is the year 2054. Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) works for pre-crime, a new agency designed to prevent all killings and murder in the District of Columbia. John believes in the system, it is perfect. But just a few days before the spreading of Pre-Crime all over the States, something unexpected happens. The three pre-cogs of Pre-Crime foresee the murder of a certain Leo Crowe by none other than John Anderton! Not even knowing who the victims is, John flees to try to unravel the mystery. Little does he know that as he begins to dig up the past, he discovers the unthinkable, that the system is not as perfect as he believes...<p>I went to see "Minority Report" just recently with high expectations for it. From all I've heard from the reviews, I was all up and ready to finally see it. I was at first VERY discouraged at the opening sequence which was to me undeniable scary, but as the film progressed I found myself very intrigued by the interesting and well-thought out plot, the exciting and breathtaking action, and body tensing suspense.<p>Steven Spielberg again does a marvelous job as the director of the film. But the film was all Tom Cruise's as each and every scene he gives such a strong role as John Anderton. He acts exceptionally well and gives a great performance with lots of character development. Also knowing that he did most of his stunts also earned a bit more respect from me. Another performance which cannot be passed by without mentioning was Colin Farrell as Witwer. Though he is somewhat like the bad guy at first, I really loved his role. Also starring is Max von Sydow as the Director of Pre-Crime, Lamar Burgess, and Samantha Morton as the pre-cog, Agatha.<p>The plot is what really makes the movie so mesmerizing. I thought the whole story was well-thought out and the whole idea about Pre-Crime is interesting. At some points the story seemed a bit like it was dragging but was soon picked up with lots of action and suspense. When the movie finally tells why John Anderton was supposed to kill Leo Crowe, I was shocked! The conclusion for me was very satisfying though some have said it was a bit disappointing. Not your usual happy ending but was in a way still satisfying. <p>The effects and action sequences were very well done. I loved all of the futuristic gadgets and new technology, especially the cars, advertisements, using the eyes for identification, and more. The action scenes were also very exciting. I especially liked the part where Tom Cruise was being chased down by his fellow agents in the alley. <p>But the movie for me did have its disappointments. For a PG-13 movie I thought that the people stretched the limitations to the very edge, making me wonder if the movie was really rated R. Like I said, the opening sequence was undeniable scary and a bit grotesque. And though it does get a bit better, the movie has its scary moments and some parts were very violent. In addition, some scenes were unnecessary and should have been cut out. Hence my reason for taking off one star, but only one star since the acting, directing, and story give a five star movie.<p>So my recommendation is to try renting the movie before buying it. And if you can't handle scary or violent movies, I suggest you stay away from "Minority Report". But if you're looking for excitement where you can actually think through the movie, check this movie out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This film puts you on the edge from the opening scenes. This storyline is fully tricked out, and takes you on a roller-coaster ride in your mind. Tom Cruise plays the part of a captain of a PreCrime Team that stop murders before they can take place.<br /><br />But all is not well for him, as he is haunted by the guilt of losing his son, and this was followed by a divorce.<br /><br />The film is set about 50 years into the future and the transport systems are way cool, and include: complex auto tranport systems, jet back packs and hover craft type military transporters.<br /><br />Observation is the key to following this film. All is not what is seems to be, the plot is as thick as plots can get. Figuring out the bad guy in this film is almost impossible, because he lies in wait quietly for his victim and is as smooth as a snake in the grass.<br /><br />This is a top notch sci-fi thriller and it's loaded with high-end special effects, but the stroyline also packs a great punch.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Directed by Steven Speilburg, this science-fiction murder mystery is an engrossing dark and brooding story.  Tom Cruise plays the lead, John Anderton, the story takes place in 2054 in Washington, DC.  Precrime has eliminated murder cases thanks to three mediums called precognitive thinkers.  The Precogs are kept in a law enforcement "temple" floating in life-sustaining fluids with their brains hooked up to electrodes.  This is so their psychic thoughts can be beamed to police screens and searched for clues on the next murder.<br /><br />John Anderton is a Precrime enforcer, whose young son was abducted and never seen again.  This tragedy ruined a marriage and caused him to use some kind of neuro drug he buys on the streets.  John is dedicated to arrest and jail would-be murderers before they kill.  Soon, a young and ambitious federal agent (Collin Farrell) shows up on the scene.  The director of Precrime (Max von Sydow) wants to make the program national, and feels threatened.  During this visit to find a flaw in the system, Anderton finds himself accused of a future murder of a man he does not know.  He no longer thinks Precrime is fail-proof.  The Precrime police chase him as they realize he will commit a murder.<br /><br />The movie is an exciting murder mystery, with imaginative special effects and a lesson on humanity's trust in hi-tech and big brother tactics.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>One major difficulty with a film of this sort is that seriously intended hocus-pocus will turn into comic hocus-pocus. I wouldn't say that this film slid over that line but it does come very close a number of times. For me,having Tom Cruise, in particular, make funny looking gestures and do awkward looking things, however justified by the written word of the script, detracts from my acceptance of the film . At any rate, I was left in something of a muddle as to whether I liked it or not, whether I thought anyone else would like it. Not having resolved that issue in my mind, I will simply say that most of the performers did quite well under the circumstances, there were some quite workable scenes, and there were all sorts of machines and gadgets to satisfy the fans of such. Those who find incredible plots and action generally inane or uninteresting should steer clear.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>What starts with a mildly interesting premise, `what if we could stop murder before it's committed by arresting the perps when they consider it' folds under the pressure of a really bland, banal execution.  Set in the future, another of those grainy monochromatic futures, Tom Cruise heads up the pre-crime division.  A trio of pre-cogs floats in a watery like womb dispensing images of murders that will be committed unless stopped.  Tom and his crew have that job.  One of the coolest things in the movie is the interaction with the flat panel LCDs of the future which appear to be glass and optic based.  Tom wears VR gloves [anyone remember the old Mattel glove? No?] and interacts with the system like a conductor with hand movements opening images, sliding things around, pretty nice.  About the only other thing of interest is the traffic in the future crawls up and down buildings vertically like cockroaches as well as horizontally on the ground.  The story is standard whodunit fare leading back to Brewmeister Smith as usual.  Has Max ever played a hero outside of Bergman? &lt;g&gt;  Anyhow, beyond the philosophical issues of pre-determination and causality there really just isn't much to the story, nothing compels us to like or care about these characters.  The near future's product placement with the GAP and bottled water only ads to the dead and depressing ambience.  Worth a look for free on cable I suppose.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>next to roles like Jerry Maguire and Ethan Hunt is Mission Immossible, theres Tom Cruise in Minority Report and this is really a great role for him and Steven Spielberg's direction and the characters and atmosphere pay off in this. obviously one of Spielberg's harshest. in the future crimes can be sceen before they ever happen and thats what Cruise and the rest of his team do, is put away the badguys, but something will happen to Cruise and he will have to run to save his own ass from being put away.

I'll start telling why this movie rules! Set in the chillingly possible future of 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is arguably the most intelligently provocative sci-fi thriller since Blade Runner. Spielberg's gritty vision was freely adapted from a story by Philip K. Dick, with its central premise of "Precrime" law enforcement, totally reliant on three isolated human "precogs" capable of envisioning murders before they're committed. As Precrime's confident captain, Tom Cruise preempts these killings like a true action hero, only to run for his life when he is himself implicated in one of the precogs' visions. Inspired by the brainstorming of expert futurists, Spielberg packs this paranoid chase with potential conspirators domestic tragedy, and a heartbreaking precog pawn, while Cruise's performance gains depth and substance with each passing scene. This is a movie not to pass up. See it today. THUMBS WAY UP!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>I'm not kidding, this is hands down the best motion picture that Mr. Spielberg has delivered us yet.  It eclipses his previous best, which of course was &quot;Close Encounters&quot; (hey, being second on that list is like being above first on anyone elses list!).<p>I'm told that there are tons of special features on this edition.  Those familiar with my reviews already know this:  I don't give a shucky-darn about DVD features.  Give me the movie with the best picture and audio quality possible.  Does &quot;Minority Report&quot; succeed on these levels?  Without a doubt.<p>Tom Cruise hasn't been this good in a long time.  Samantha Morton was robbed of an Academy Award nomination for her work here as the main 'precog'.  Don't know what a 'precog' is?  You need to see this movie!  The effects will boggle the mind of even the most jaded moviegoer.  You've never seen anything like this!  With &quot;A.I.&quot;, Mr. Spielberg was said to be channelling the spirit of the late Stanley Kubrick.  True, but equally true here.  No, the late Mr. Kubrick had nothing to do with this film, but the influence is simply undeniable.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>This is the 2nd best movie of 2002. It has ver good acting, great story, incredible visual effects, and the perfect soundtrack. The movie is set in 2054, with its central premise of "Precrime" law enforcement, totally reliant on three isolated human "precogs" capable of seeing the future. That's original, so I knew I'd enjoy this. I was at the edge of my seat in awe of how great this movie was, and it wasn't even over! Anyway, as Precrime's confident captain, Tom Cruise preempts these killings like a true action hero, only to run for his life when he is himself implicated in one of the precogs' visions. He makes one heck an escape, even has his eyes changed! Making good use of astonishing special effects, Minority Report brilliantly extrapolates a future that's utterly convincing, and pretty dang cool if you ask me. It knid of reminds me of A.I Artificial Intelligence. You must see this movie, it is so good. BUY IT NOW!</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>but that's about it.  Some of the effects are really cool to look at, but the mixture of mod-tech with a realtively visually unchanged rest of the world looked off to me.  Also, the story is pretty pedestrian in spite of it's excellent premise.  Underneath all of the fancy gadgets and clever lights is the same old tired mystery that is too easy to figure out. Cruise is neither a great actor nor action hero(although he does display some good pantomime skills)and should start to rethink his carreer choices.  Anyway, it's fun to look at for the first 90 of its' 225 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>This is definatly one of Cruise' best and my favorite of Spielberg's after A.I. Minority Report is snappy, fun and intriguing as Cruise fights to break the rules and find the murderer of his son, and the man who he is supposed to kill.<br /><br />I say supposed, for Cruise is chief of Police, and Collaberater on a project called PreCrime.<br /><br />PreCrime in short is supposed to find and stop crimes before they've happened all due to the pheoninimal powers given to three people called the precogs. The Precogs dream of the crimes which is wired into a computer that allows Cruise to view and find the murders. Capture and imprison them.<br /><br />The only problem is that there is a minority report, being that some preplanned crimes where simply that. Preplanned but without going to really be enacted. Cruise finds this out when he himself is accused of a murder, sending this chief of police on a wild run to escape. Even more intense as Colin Farrell arrives as the FBI agent sent to take over the operations. And who goes after Cruise, even more deadset on capturing then the cops as he believes Precrime is bogus and wrong.<br /><br />So there's the basic formula to this movie, but what a movie it is. Think of it as Catch me if you can in a space age world, hectic and intrancing.<br /><br />Spielberg is a genus, and he weaves and tells this story like the best of them. So sit back and enjoy, and let the master take you away into his world.....</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this was supposed to be a glimpse into a very possible future.i heard on an hbo special that the directer payed the top experts in almost every field to come to his house for the weekend to discuss the realities that will be in the future.the fields included automative,law enforcement,science,marketing etc.im having a hard time beliving this now.the whole point of this story has any basis in reality at all.there are these 3 psycic chicks who the government keeps in a tank.there only function is to send mental images into these computers that fortell future murders.the murder rate drops to 0 and the system is perfect.well one day tom cruise gets his name as a would be murderer and decides to buck the system.there is a child abduction/murder angle in this movie.i think it is unthinkable enough that this really happens.i think it is an abselute atrocity that moviemakers feel like they have to put that in movies.i watch movies for entertainment not to be reminded how sick and twisted this world really is.or two hours i could escape the  harsh realities.then some jerk says hmmmm we could use any bad guy we want.lets use a child killer.that sucks!i would have rated this movie a 4,if not for that.steven spielsberg is your director.ill give him yet another award.the most overated directer of all time.this is his best work ever though.theres a lot of slow parts in it also.a lot of police detective type work and talk.there are a couple gross parts but if you dont mind watching a movie centered around a child killer youll be alright.when the bad guy is finaly met,a very intense scene goes on.i was right there.the main psycic chick would be sexy if she wasnt so damn wierd.tom cruise does a great job in this one.this is a very good movie all in all but the hype makes it sound better.this is tom cruises 2nd best movie.this movie drags on longer than most.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>Sure, the special fx are fun to watch, but nothing ground-breaking.

What could have been a more profound statement on free-will and future-control turns out to be a less-than-satisfying murder mystery.  &quot;Is that all,&quot; I asked as the mystery was revealed.  I found the revelation and the &quot;point&quot; of the film anticlimactic.<p>Also -- one major continuity flaw.  If the agency was on the look-out for Anderton, how in the world could he get in to their facility TWICE without being noticed?  He used his own eyes to get past security.  Don't you think that someone in the agency -- a computer at the least, would have alerted them that he was in the building?  It almost seemed silly at this point.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Minority Report" is the latest audacious triumph from America's premier filmmaker, Steven Spielberg.  Unlike most successful directors, who are content to rest on their laurels and keep producing works of similar theme and content, Spielberg is not afraid to test the limits of his medium by producing works that are both spellbinding and visionary.  He is even willing to risk alienating a mass audience unequipped or unwilling to come along with him on his journey of discovery (which partly explains the relative box office failure of his masterful "A.I." in 2001).  It is ironic that Spielberg, who is often charged (falsely) will being largely responsible for the "dumbing down" of American movies over the past several decades, is now making more intelligent and adult-oriented films than virtually anyone working in Hollywood today.<p>The theme of "Minority Report" is very similar to the one found in "A Clockwork Orange":  just how far are we willing to go in trading away a person's civil rights in order to achieve a society devoid of the threat of crime and violence.  In "Orange," the society of the future attempted to head criminality off at the pass by "reprogramming" potential criminals before they had the chance to actually commit the crimes.  "Minority Report," based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, creates a future society that has managed to find a way to do virtually the same thing, only, in this case, scientists have enlisted the aid of genetic mutants who have the ability to witness murders before they happen and can then pass that information on to the authorities.  Law enforcement now becomes a matter of apprehending and imprisoning criminals BEFORE they have even committed the crime.  The problem arises when John Anderton, one of the "Pre-Crime" agency's top cops, is himself shown to be a future murderer.  The plot of the film becomes, essentially, the classic chase story, in which an "innocent" man must elude his pursuers while at the same time unraveling the clues that will ultimately lead to his proving his innocence.  From this material, writers Scott Frank and John Cohen have fleshed out an intricate and fascinating plot that keeps us guessing all the way to the film's finale.<p>In many ways, though, it is not in the narrative details that "Minority Report"'s true greatness lies (after all, this story is basically a redo of this year's earlier, abysmal "Imposter," which, by the way, was also derived from a Dick story).  It is the vision that Spielberg brings to the material that sets it apart.  Rarely have we ever seen a future world brought so vividly and believably to life as it is here.  Set in 2054, the film is a total visual masterpiece.  Aided by astonishing production design, cinematography and special effects, Spielberg has created a universe unlike any we have seen before.  One of his most triumphant moves is to not try and imagine the future in totally unfamiliar terms.  Most of the clothes and furnishings seem strangely similar to what we have today.  The effect of this is to help us identify with the characters in a way that might not have been possible had everything been made to seem alien and unrecognizable.  What the filmmakers do emphasize in their vision of the future world is the constant barrage of audio/visual stimuli that come in the form of things like personalized holograms and animated periodicals which pinpoint just how close our own world is moving towards this sort of all-encompassing sensory overload.  <p>In a day and age in which even the most elaborate special effects can elicit a yawn from the audience, Spielberg still shows that he has the ability to dazzle us.  There is a chase scene done on a vertical superhighway that far surpasses anything in this summer's "Spiderman" or "Attack of the Clones" for sheer breathtaking ingenuity and excitement.  In fact, on the visual/special effects level alone, "Minority Report" makes those other two films look like first-year film school pikers.  It's also impossible to convey just how extraordinarily brilliant cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's work is on this film.  With his muted color scheme and emphasis on glowing whites, Kaminski brings a true otherworldly quality to Spielberg's vision.<p>Like all great Spielberg films (and there are so many we can't even count them anymore), "Minority Report" packs a wallop both in the overwhelming intensity of its action sequences and in the quiet moments of subtle reflection where the filmmaker affords us glimpses into the workings of the human heart.  The director is helped immeasurably in the first case by the brilliant editing of Michael Kahn, and in the second by the outstanding performance of Tom Cruise in the lead role.  Cruise has rarely brought such dramatic intensity or such emotional depth to any character the way he does to John Anderton.  The long delayed and long anticipated collaboration between one of the world's greatest directors and one of the world's most charismatic stars has resulted in a film worthy of both of their talents and reputations.<p>In a time when filmmakers like George Lucas seem mired in the successes of their past, Spielberg continues to move ahead and to develop ever more as an artist.  Even if he were to stop making movies today, Spielberg's oeuvre would put him in the pantheon of the world's greatest film artists of all time.  But let us hope he will continue to make films for a very long time to come.  We eagerly await all those future masterpieces.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I was not a fan of Steven Spielberg's movies prior to "Artificial Intelligence."  I liked his films ok prior to that one but the schmaltz factor in them was too much for me.  However, with both "Artificial Intelligence" and  "Minority Report," he brings intelligence to his films plus a visionary look at our futures that I find spellbinding.  So I am now a fan. There is "Precrime" law enforcement in this 2054 Philip K. Dick envisioned world.  It is reliant on 3 human "precogs" in an isolation tank.  They are able to envision murders before they're committed. Precrime officers arrest perpetrators right before they murder and the supposed offenders are confined in isolated tanks for the rest of their lives.  But are the precogs infallible or is there free will right up to the final moment of crime commission?  Tom Cruise, as the top policeman of Precrime, is about to find out. Someone wants him out of that job and having the precogs "see" him kill someone in the future is a darn good way of achieving that.  With that, the movie is off and I was enthralled every step of the way.  The effects are incredible and I am not someone usually taken with special effects.  Cruise is magnificent as is Samantha Morton as the chief precog, Agatha. Speilberg picks the perfect supporting cast to put behind them too every step of the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg has fashioned a sleek, physically beautiful, most of the time engrossing film set in Washington DC, in the future 50 years hence.<br />John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is an elite "pre-crime" cop whose department uses pre-cognizants (fortune tellers, really) to fortell where and when murders will occur. Anderton's crew then responds by stopping the crime before it happens.<br />Anderton is a troubled soul having lost his 6 yr old son under mysterious circumstances as well as his wife in divorce. Through the use of up to date technology he is able to view his son and wife by way of magical, life-like 3-D images; which he does nightly in scenes brought about by remorse as well as the inhalation of drugs he buys off the street.<br />Tom Cruise, having finally lived through his boyish good looks, gives an extremely resonant, muti-faceted performance: he is asked to be emotionally aware as well as physically polished and he is much more effective and emphathetic here than he was in "Vanilla Sky."<br />Colin Farrel, a part of the new guard of young actors; excellent in "Tigerland", does a remarkable job of playing off and with both Cruise and Max Von Sydow. In this he plays a District Attorney lackey out to confiscate the "pre-crime" technology for the Government and uses any means possible to do so.<br />Spielberg uses Hitchcock as his guiding force for the last third of the film as it turns into a chase film/thriller with Anderton on the run from the people he once supervised.  There are big chunks of film comparable to the very best of "Rear Window"and "Vertigo." I think that the film runs on too long by about 10 minutes but this a a minor quibble.<br />Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report"is an interesting, heart-felt, emotionally true and physically beautiful film with sympathetic portrayals by Cruise, Farrell, Von Sydow and Samantha Morton as one of the pre-cognizants.  All concerned should be proud of their accomplisment.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>"MINORITY REPORT" IS A TRULY MIND BLOWING MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE!

The precogs, a trio of psychics blessed (cursed?) with the ability to see murders before they happen, are named Arthur, Dashiell, and Agatha.  Fans of Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade, or Hercule Poirot will thus be 'clued' in that this is a detective story of another colour.  Less obviously, but much more relevant, the story neatly parallels the Sophoclean tale of Oedipus Rex.  You remember him, don't you?  He tried to avoid a future prophesized by an oracle, in which he would kill his father and marry his mother.  But fates have a funny way of coming true; not only did the prophecy hold, but he lost his eyes in the process.  I wonder if any of this sounds familiar to John Anderton?<p>At times, the film feels like something Paul Verhoeven ("Total Recall", another Dick story, but also "RoboCop") or Ridley Scott ("Blade Runner", the uber-Dick screen adaptation, but also "Alien") would have churned out.  But when the omnipresent John Williams score kicks in, and the near-hokey scenes of a precious little boy rear their heads, you know you've entered Steven Spielberg country.<p>"Minority Report" is only Spielberg's second movie to combine intellectually adult ideas with a popcorn-thriller sensibility.  "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", the other such entry in his oeuvre, had a much greater sense of innocence and wonder, but not nearly as much bravura filmmaking.  Spielberg's camera seems to be doing cartwheels at times.  It became very disorienting in the action-heavy sequences (not helped by the harsh lighting that dominates the frame), but the effect worked in that it kept the audience on their toes and paying attention during the more measured scenes.<p>Besides story, Spielberg's other strength is in creating cutting-edge visuals.  On this note, he does not disappoint.  A fascinating vision of a credible future is laid at the audience's feet.  Although learned sci-fi fans will have seen many of its characteristics in other futuristic dystopias (the hyper-predomination of advertising was in "Blade Runner"; retinal scans were used in... uh... "Barb Wire"), this one is different in that it has the full power of the Spielberg machine behind it.  He apparently consulted successful futurists to come up with a vision for 2054.  What they've succeeded in providing is a world of urban decay, but also gargantuan and clean office buildings; oppressive mass transit systems, but also quaint backcountry roads; high-tech apartments, and homogenous urban sprawl.  In short, a diverse world.  Spielberg achieves a unified vision through a wide variety of styles that is quite impressive.<p>He also does a fine job of keeping the audience on their toes with multiple moments of squirmy terror, followed by some fine, understated comic relief.  The former is exemplified by one scene that makes you think it's about to quote "Un Chien Andalou", and the latter is exemplified in an "Evil Dead"-esque moment where Anderton chases his own eyeballs down a hall.  A scene where retinal scanning spiders search an apartment building will have those with arachnophobia clutching their armrests, while laughing at the quirky personalities the spiders take on.  This is Spielberg at his most playful; he has the audience right where he wants them, and he pulls and pushes them with all the skill of a master puppeteer.<br /><br />The film's one flaw, from a directorial standpoint, is something that also marred Spielberg's last effort, "A.I.".  Like that more bloated failure, Spielberg teases the audience with multiple endings.  The difference being that what felt tacked on and manipulative in his last movie (a Hail Mary attempt to achieve a happy ending) becomes almost necessary here.  The 'first' ending, if he had left it as such, would have been perfectly serviceable to the story he was trying to tell.  Because he went further -- through the looking glass, past the closet, to the other side of the curtain -- the story opens itself up to ask (and answer) many other relevant questions.  Unfortunately, the flow of the movie was constantly being disrupted, as ending became twist became ending became twist, ad nausea.  These "fourth" act problems caused the movie to be a tad overlong.  Also, there were many opportunities to trim the film that Spielberg didn't take advantage of, prior to the denouements.  He indulges in too many scenes of talky exposition that slow the action down to a near standstill.  A less powerful man behind the camera might have been forced to bring the movie in under 2 hours.  Spielberg didn't have that luxury.<p>He did have the luxury of casting a likable and bankable star in the lead role.  Cruise learned many a lesson from the jumble that was "Vanilla Sky" (he even gets to ugly himself up again).  John Anderton appears to be a typical Tom Cruise character: a loving dad, determined in action, heroic in battle.  But he's also a terribly flawed character, destroyed by tragedy.  And if you really sit back and take in the plot, you realize that Anderton is little more than a cipher, a pawn used to move the plot along to its inevitable conclusion.<p>The rest of the cast, none with very meaty roles, are all exceptional in supporting Cruise.  Samantha Morton as the dominant precog, the aforementioned Von Sydow and Farrell, and Lois Smith as an enigmatic scientist, all do fine work.<p>While not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, "Minority Report" will please those looking for an intelligent film fix in an otherwise bland summer, those looking for a Spielberg fix in the wake of the unfulfilling "A.I.", and those looking for a Cruise action fix in between "Mission Impossibles".  And it'll probably please the rest of you too.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan. He plays to the media too much. I've believed for some time that he's more like the character he plays in Magnolia than the nice guy he pretends to be. So the character he plays in Minority Report is perfect for him; he's a flawed hero with a drug problem. <p>Tinsel Town has had a crush on Philip K. Dick for the past twenty or so years. Blade Runner was the first--and one of the best (despite a very flawed script)adaptions of Dick's paranoid world view. Phil Dick's stories have always been about the psychology and motivation of the characters (and well developed plots) more than spaceships and the future. That's why, perhaps, his stories have endured. Total Recall, Screamers and Imposter all had their moments (the best moments were from Dick's original stories).<p>Minority Report stands as probably the sharpest adaption of both Dick's work and world view. It's pretty darn violent and the script (despite a major plot flaw) well written. It's your typical Spielberg production--suspenseful and well thought out (for the most part). The casting is great although some of it, again, is a bit predictable which makes the ending a bit easy to foresee (ironic isn't it?)<p>The plot in a nutshell--in the future precogs (people who can see the possible futures) can predict who will be murdered and by whom. The police arrest the prep prior to the crime thus preventing the crime from occuring. Cruise is one these elite officers and one of the founders of this specialized police force. He's on their side until he is apparently--somehow--framed for a murder of someone he has never met. Suddenly, Cruise is on the run out to discover who framed him and why. (SPOILER ALERT)There's also another unsolved murder that may or may not have something to do with his case.<p>Cruise attempts to elude the very people he trained and worked with to prove his innocence. A typical Hitchcock (and Dick) theme--the innocent man framed and on the run. In many respects, Minority Report plays as a 02 version of Hitch's own North By Northwest (and there are some witty visual references to Hitch's film as well as those Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and other sf films).<p>Minority Report is a rewarding two hour ride with both heart and soul. The story is solid and well thought out (although, again, with a significant flaw). It's also a demonstration of Speilberg's new found maturity as a film director. He couldn't have possibly made this adult, mature film ten or even five years ago. He had the skill but not the soul for it. I'd highly recommend this fine film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg has joined the ranks of Ridley Scott and Paul Verhoeven in adapting a Philip K. Dick story to the big screen. As such, one would expect a dose of urban dystopia, of cold despairing existentialism, to temper his sentimental streak. It almost does.<p>For most of Minority Report's 146 minute running time, it was beginning to look like Spielberg's considerable cinematic craft was not going to undermine itself. It was taut, suspenseful, and - for the most part - credible, in that the film did not violate its own logic.<p>But even early on, there were cracks starting to appear. For example, pre-crime cop John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has to get back into a secure area unnoticed, so he has his eyes replaced to fool the retinal scanners (this IS the future after all, and such things are possible). He has to do this because he is wanted by the police for a crime he WILL commit in a couple of days, and he is after evidence that he thinks will clear his name. He not only has replaced his eyeballs, but also paralyzed his facial muscles so his countenance will be unrecognizable (although he still looked a lot like Tom Cruise, to me). <p>But then there's the problem of the lock on the door. How do you suppose he gets past? Why, by using his old eyeball fished from a zip-lock bag.<p>Uh...you mean, when a cop is wanted for murder they don't immediately revoke his clearance? Erase his user account from the lock computers? Flag his retinal scan as inoperative? And even if they stupidly failed to do so, would the computer not alert someone that a wanted man had just gotten in? Finally, if he was going to use his own eyeball to gain entry, anyway, why didn't he just LEAVE IT IN HIS HEAD?!<p>Yet, this incredible lapse of logic I was almost willing to forgive, as one amazing set-piece followed another: Gritty future-DC locations. Fascist-looking cops in riot-gear. Cruise missing arrest by the closest of margins. Exciting, noirish stuff, like the best scenes in Blade Runner.<p>Then came the last 20 minutes. I mean, the plot flew apart like a jet engine hit by a frozen turkey. It ends with Cruise explaining everything in a long, dull monolog to the killer. This monolog is necessary for the audience because the third act is so poorly structured that we can't figure it out for ourselves. (Spielberg should have watched Chinatown a couple of times - its complex plot came together clearly with nary a word needed.) Worse, the killer (Max Von Sydow) already KNOWS what Cruise has to say because - DUH! - HE'S THE KILLER! And, of course, the well-oiled machine of the pre-crime unit becomes conveniently rusty (why are there no law-enforcement people at a LAW-ENFORCEMENT CONVENTION?!) to allow time for a nice, long showdown between Cruise and Max Von Sydow.<p>The final insult to the intelligence is when Von Sydow uses a gold-plated ceremonial award pistol as an actual weapon. It even conveniently has live ammunition in its red velvet display case. This last bit is something I would expect from a bad made-for-cable film, not movie that cost the GNP of a small country to make. Sheesh!<p>The technical credits are outstanding, with great special effects and first rate cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. Cruise and Von Sydow are good in their rolls, as are Samantha Morton as the "pro-cog" Agatha, Jessica Capshaw as Evanna, and Peter Stormare as the creepy eye surgeon. <p>Ultimately, though, it just doesn't hold up. The first parts are so good and the last so terrible that the sense of being cheated knocks Minority Report down to a mere two stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Preventative maintenance can go a long way in getting a lot of extra miles out of that new car, and without question, applying the same principles to health care can add years to your life.  That's what "prevention" is all about; averting disaster and tragedy by taking measures to stop it before it happens.  It's certainly not a unique concept, by any means (at least when it comes to things like cars and health care), but what about in terms of crime?  Murder, for example; can there possibly be a way to anticipate and prevent even that?  It's a proposition that director Steven Spielberg addresses in "Minority Report," a drama/thriller set in the near future, in which a kind of "HMO for Crime" has been established that does just that:  A system that unerringly predicts and prevents murder.  But just how accurate is it, really?  Can such an operation be infallible beyond any doubt?  That-- as they say-- is the question.<p>In Washington D.C., 2054, a "PreCrime" unit has been in operation for some six years now, under the leadership of Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).  Using a system whereby murder can be detected before it happens-- and thus averted-- the unit has successfully eliminated that particular crime in the D.C. area.  One of the driving forces behind it all is Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who has something of a vested interest in making this system work:  Just before the inception of this revolutionary unit, Anderton suffered a tragedy in his own life; the kind of tragedy he hopes that no one else will ever have to endure again because of their efforts here.<p>Anderton's unit has been something of a prototype, however, and with the success rate they have enjoyed, the U.S. government is interested in taking the project nationwide.  But they want to look a little deeper into the operation first, and so agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is dispatched to investigate and root out any potential flaws that may have been overlooked on the local level.  Burgess and Anderton maintain that the system is infallible, but then something happens-- Anderton himself is "seen" committing a murder in the near future.  And it's going to happen in about thirty-six hours...<p>With films like "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan," Steven Spielberg has long since established himself as one of the "Greats" among film directors.  Much of his success comes from the fact that he likes to tell stories about "people," and he always manages to find the human element within the story that make his films so engaging.  Even the best filmmaker, however, is not going to produce a work of genius every time out; just as within every human being there is "good" cholesterol and "bad" cholesterol, so it must be with the films of an artist of Spielberg's magnitude-- it is natural that his resume will include both.  And this film-- which, without question is a good film-- is just not as compelling as some of his previous efforts.  One of the reasons, I think, is that it is an inherently dark tale, and Spielberg is by nature too positive to take it to the depths that would have really made it emotionally absorbing.  <p>As good as Spielberg is at exploring the complexities of human nature, he tends to get distracted by the environment within he must work to tell certain stories (like this one).  He seems to have an innate aversion to things too dark, at which times he seems to turn to the gadgets, toys and myriad F/X at his disposal for diversion, and quite frankly, his vision of the future in this film fails to evoke that necessary sense of disquiet or foreboding in the way that Ridley Scott did so successfully in "Blade Runner," for example.  The "look" of this film is more "amusement park ride" than the gritty realism of Scott's film.  Compare and consider the differences between this film and "A.I" (another film with a dark, decidedly "non-Spielbergian" theme), and "E.T" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."  The latter, while falling within the Sci-fi genre, are basically upbeat, positive stories, with "E.T.," especially, focusing on the characters rather than-- or at least equal to-- the events as they occur.  And nobody does a film like that better than Steven Spielberg.  <p>This film was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, and If only Spielberg (and the screenwriters) had been more willing to embrace the dark side of this story, he may have been able to create the kind of suspense that made "Jaws" so on-the-edge-of-your-seat riveting.  But, again-- though this is a decent movie-- it simply is not the taut thriller it could have been, like Tony Scott's "Enemy of the State," which in many ways is similar to this film.  There again, the sense of paranoia and suspense Tony Scott achieved with his film was due to the fact that he embraced the darkness and immersed himself (and his film) in it. <p>As Anderton, Tom Cruise gives a convincing performance and (as evidenced in "Vanilla Sky") he is continuing to mature as an actor.  His trademark smile is there, of course, but he is relying on it less and less, which is helping him to develop his characters with more depth and detail, as he does here with his portrayal of Anderton.<p>Max von Sydow, as usual, turns in a believable performance as Burgess, but the character is intrinsically stereotypical, and he simply isn't afforded the time to develop his portrayal much beyond that.  <p>The standout performances come from Colin Farrell, who lends some real nuance to his character and manages to make him truly three-dimensional; and from Samantha Morton, who creates the most emotionally involving character of the film with her portrayal of Agatha; and it's part of what makes "Minority Report" (like any Spielberg film-- even the "lesser" ones) worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Imagine if you could be charged & arrested for a crime you were ABOUT to commit?  That is the premise behind Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report".<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, the film (set in the future) focuses on John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the highly successful "Pre-Crime" unit, which (with help from three special pre-cognizants) are able to predict a murder BEFORE it occurs, rendering the crime rate almost nil.  However, Anderton suddenly finds himself the target of a pre-crime investigation, and embarks on a crusade to prove his innocence...which in itself is in doubt until the shocking conclusion.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the film excellently delivers a high-concept topic in a way that both creates high drama and gets you thinking about the possibility of such events actually occurring.  At its heart, "Minority Report" is a concept film, but one in which the events are portrayed (thanks to Spielberg) in such a linear, easy-to-understand manner that it actually feels like an action-adventure epic.<br /><br />The acting, with Cruise leading the way, is also entertaining, as Cruise plays a very convoluted Anderton.  On one hand, he believes in the PreCrime system with all his heart.  On the other, he grapples with the fact that he himself could be a casualty of that very system.<br /><br />About the only thing I didn't like about this film were some of the extended action scenes.  While flashy, in terms of real-ness they were much more suited for, say, a James Bond film.  In other words, a bit too fakey for my tastes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept film that will keep you thinking, draw you into the characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat.  Creatively, I compare it to Blade Runner, although much better in terms of the action/adventure angle, whereas Blade Runner seems so bleak.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>This movie made me squirrely, disconcerted, agitated, not because it was a movie with an important message to convey, but because it was exploitive and edgy just for the sake of edginess.<br />It's a futuristic overwrought work in which a precrime unit in Washington, DC, in 2054 prevents murders by using pre-cogs, pre-cognitive slaves who can see into the future and predict crimes that are going to take place. The three pre-cogs, male twins and a woman are kept in a vat of water with electrodes attached. The means justifies the ends, get it.<br />Tom Cruise is head of the unit; he's an anally-retentive, wired spring about to snap. He seems constipated or suffering from hemorrhoids throughout. He plays the role with extreme seriousness. Warning: the series of scenes about his eyes are very disconcerting. Scanners can identify people by their eyes so you get the picture.<br />Without giving any of the plot away, it's sufficient to say all the stuff regarding Tom Cruise's eyes is excruciatingly painful to view.<br />It's an unrelenting movie in which the tables are turned, and the crime fighters target Cruise. In super-hero fashion he fights off platoons of "cops," and learns that he has been set up. His escape with the female pre-cog is harrowing and too disconcerting. He performs unbelievable feats in his escape.<br />Max von Sydow is very good as Cruise's wily boss. Colin Farrell has a one-dimensional role that doesn't give him a chance to show off his real acting talent. Veteran actress Lois Smith is very good as the morally reprehensible "mad" scientist who even makes a pass at Cruise.<br />If this is your taste, you'll love it. If it isn't, you may cringe. Optical surgeons may shed a few tears over it.

It enters the realm of future techno dystopia when Minority Report based on Philip K. Dick's short story opens in 2054 with Anderton (Cruise) as chief of Pre-Crime Unit which banks on the dreams of Pre-cogs to arrest would-be felons. The story takes a twist to thriller when Anderton is framed; he is guilty of a fatal shootout - and there he runs to escape his colleagues and a sealed murderer's fate. It is a mystery when events culminate to map out relevance to his son's abduction. It is a resonant cautionary tale to explore on topics like original sin and privacy issues. Minority Report sees Spielberg at the zenith of his visions, fusing sprawling sets of sleek designs to compliment the galanizing action that sees Anderton fleeing through whizzing Lexus in vertical highways. To silence the cynics, he ventures into his darker side to effectively convey violence. The noir thriller is thick with Hitchcockian red herrings and imbued with shadows of paranoia to render first-rate suspense. No less luminous is the cast including Samantha Morton as the talented Pre-Cog who gives heart to the movie, Max von Sydow as the dominating boss and Colin Farrel as Anderton's rival. Probably his best performance to date, Tom Cruise lends emotional depth and grit under his brooding exterior. Minority Report is provocative and slyly humorous in its hidden entrende of Pre-cogs as Agatha, Arthur and Dashiell who are famous mystery authors. This is Spielberg's extension of A.I with unfettered creativity, pitch-perfect technicality and balanced senitmentality to submit a report card that would definitely please the majority.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>You will see things in this movie you have never seem before. The action is done in new and interesting ways. The plot is interesting (especially for what is really an action flick) and will keep you involved all the way through.<br /><br />All of the actors give very good performances and though the special effects are quite amazing they are used in the service of the story. One little example is the animated cereal box that irritates Anderton (Tom Cruise) so he chucks it across the room. The point is on Anderton not the box even though that effect is interesting. There are many many many effects like that in this movie.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the movie a great deal there were a couple or three scenes that caused me real discomfort. I think (and feel free to disagree with me on this) that some things in this movie aren't for people under sixteen even though it is rated PG-13 it does have some sexual scenes that while not overt would make me uncomfortable with my 14 year old with me.<br /><br />I liked the movie enough to want it to be a big success, but not enough to tell my kids to go see it. I think it is a better movie that "Sum of All Fears" which I also liked, but I would rather my kids saw that movie. This movie is an action movie, but has enough of a point to almost be a serious piece - it really is that interesting. However, it pulls back from a serious examination of the points it raises - but that isn't the point of this movie, is it?<br /><br />It IS really an action movie, so let's not begrudge it its true nature. Don't get too bent out of shape at the gaps in the logic of the plot. As in all noir films, there is FUN to be had in all the movie misery and pain (which woludn't be fun in real life).<br /><br />But if you love an involved and interesting story, and relish seeing things you haven't seen before this is a good movie for you. Just beware of that it will be a rough ride at a couple of spots along the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>One can never underestimate director Steven Spielberg's ability to reinvent himself as a filmmaker.  MINORITY REPORT is just another example of this.<p>Set in Washington D.C. circa 2053, MINORITY REPORT is based ona 1956 short story by Philip K. Dick, whose works provided the source material for the ultra-violent 1990 smash TOTAL RECALL and Ridley Scott's 1982 cult masterpiece BLADE RUNNER.  Tom Cruise stars as the top cop of an elite anti-crime police unit called Pre-Crime, which has the ability, by way of three pre-cognitive beings, to see crimes of the future and stop not only the crimes but to stop the perpetrators from committing those crimes to begin with.<p>But when a national referendum on Pre-Crime takes shape, an unscrupulous underling (Colin Farrell) to the Attorney General puts a flaw into the system intended to lead to Pre-Crime's own undoing.  That flaw is a vision of Cruise himself committing murder against a man he doesn't even know and has never met.  Cruise becomes a man on the run, and the result is a hair-raising series of suspense-laden twists and turns that never bores, despite the fact that the film is two hours and fifteen minutes long.<p>Under Spielberg's always inventive direction, Cruise is sharp as the beleagured cop trying to get out of his most complicated fix.  Samantha Morton is also quite good as the "pre-cog" known as Agatha, and the legendary Max von Sydow scores as Cruise's boss and mentor who has a stake in seeing Pre-Crime remain perfect.  A film that deftly puts elements of the crime and psychological thriller film genres into its futuristic science fiction brew, MINORITY REPORT is a film that, like Spielberg's previous film A.I., may very well require more than one viewing; it certainly is not a leave-your-brains-at-the-door film.  But it is well worth seeing!</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>very good special effects, decent action, and a good story. pretty good extras, but no commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>I can best sum this film as a police thriller in the future.  Its story line in itself provides an entrancing mixture of suspense, thrills, and action (all naturally embellished by Speilberg's direction).  But there's more to this film than that.<p>The entire movie is filmed with monotonous colors (except for one flashback scene).  There are many gray, black, white, and blue colors (similar to the way &quot;Payback&quot; was filmed).  I wouldn't doubt that the coloring of the film adds an artistic level to it, and perhaps highlights some important motifs.  It also makes the future world appear darker and gritter, despite the effects of excessive commercialization.<p>There are other interesting motifs involved, including water (water water everywhere!) and eyeballs (many closeups of eyeballs, not to mention the fact that the main character gets new eyeballs installed in his sockets).  There are a lot of interesting devices in the film that gives it cinemagraphic depth.<p>The film's ideas of the future in themselves are interesting, particularly since they are derived from a compilation of minds.  There are holograms everywhere and retnail scans everywhere.  Privacy is starting to become abolished.  Genetic technology was discussed briefly.  There are many other aspects, but the most abundant seems to be the role of visual graphics.  Holograms and motion video have become a part of daily life - everything is in motion.  People can even manipulate the video images with their hands, as if they were orchestrating them in a holographic orchestra.<p>The characters of the film are fairly well developed.  I found the most interesting characters to be the 'precogs' who can detect murders before they happen.  They remind me of the guild navigators from &quot;Dune,&quot; only the precogs are more emotional and traumatized characters.<p>Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable film, perhaps even the best Speilberg film of them all (it is certainly my favourite Tom Cruise film).  It's visions of the future, characters, and story have stuck to my brain like an echo.  I can't help but to see it again...and again...like an echo...</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />Having just seen this movie for the first time at the time of writing this, I'm amazed and shocked.  Amazed at how great a film this is, and shocked at why I never bothered to watch it until now. Steven Spielberg has long been a favorite of mine when it comes to directors, and I always thought Tom Cruise wasn't too bad an actor himself. But with that said, Minority Report is an excellent piece of science fiction that works on a number of levels. For me personally, I enjoyed a lot of the film's moral and philosophical quandaries about science in general, its eventual over-dependence by society, the analogies between it and religion, the flaws and doubt of systemization (particularly in law enforcement), and finally, the gravity of our choices and how they can affect the future. Spielberg does a tremendous job weaving all of these issues into a deep enough narrative that gets you thinking, but also manages to entertain, as seen by some of the very sleek action sequences and visual effects. I also enjoyed a great deal of the screenplay and how it dispersed just the right amounts of action, adventure, drama, mystery, and thriller, never faltering and building up to a very satisfying last act. If anything, I just wish the movie were longer and a little more focused on any of the story elements mentioned above as opposed to all of them at an equally sparse level. Regardless, though, it's an excellent movie crafted by one of the best in the business and well-acted by a great group of core actors in Cruise, Farrell, von Sydow, and even Peter Stormare with his brief appearance. Minority Report is a film that, like a lot of science fiction, has more questions than answers, but with a cool and stylish kind of gritty sheen that will probably satisfy serious and popcorn audiences alike.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />This HD master is Spielberg-approved, so who am I to argue? Minority Report is presented by Paramount in absolute pristine fashion. From the very beginning of the film to its end Janusz Kaminski's dark, yet gorgeous cinematography his preserved to perfection. Colors aren't quite as vibrant in conjunction to the film's drab art direction, but I feel they're very representative of the story's nature. Sharpness and image detail also look quite good with a great deal of dimensionality and depth between the actors, visual, and CG effects. But the biggest positives are in the black levels and contrast. Blacks are extremely deep with fine detail between lines and shadows, never losing consistency or getting lost within the photography, thanks in large part to the complimenting contrast. Skin textures, objects, and backgrounds are as good as they'll ever look outside of 3D or holograms. There's also a fine layer of grain providing for a very commendable theatrical look as well, which in some cases reveals some tiny, tiny instances of artifacting and debris, but if you're not even looking for them, it's certainly nothing to complain about. Other than that, there don't seem to be any signs of image enhancement or manipulation whatsoever.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Equally matching its video is a reference-quality DTS-HD 5.1 track. I actually hadn't seen a Spielberg movie on BD until Minority Report, so I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard. The first thing that struck me was John Williams' score (another BD audio-first) and it's subtle, yet immersive presence. It does a good job setting the pace and mood for the film and gives off some excellent fidelity for heavy string and percussion instruments in particular. Dialogue is always clear and understandable from the center channel as well and never suffers from dropout or distortion. In terms of effects, the sound design stays mostly quiet, as a lot of the movie is dialogue. But being the master film-maker Spielberg is, what action and chase sequences he does use manage to really give the sound system a workout. High and low ends for all the technology usage are pitch-perfect, directionality and separation are tight and discernible from one another, and LFEs, while not too frequent, really give the room a pleasant rumble when present. My favorite bit of sound display you could probably use for showcasing would be the Car Factory chase. It represents a little bit of everything from music to sound effects placement to a very cool bass effect in the Sonic Gun he uses to take down some of his pursuers.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />Minority Report comes packed with a lot of the special features from the DVD release as well as some exclusive material in HD to compliment this newly minted BD release. Amounting to almost three hours worth of information, I learned quite a bit from these extras and found it fascinating just how much work went into all the production aspects. Everything from casting and writing, set and prop design, special and visual effects, sound design, music composition, and cinematography are covered to great length. In particular, I really enjoyed the Phillip K. Dick segment and a lot of the comments from cast and crew about the film's production and adaptation. Although, I am a bit disappointed that the film itself doesn't have any kind of audio or P-i-P commentary from Spielberg. But with that said, the extras still offer quite a bit of food for thought.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />Minority Report is another excellent entry into the science fiction genre. In the hands of Steven Spielberg, he manages to infuse a very thought-provoking premise with a fun, action-packed screenplay making for a very entertaining, yet poignant film that brings about a lot of questions in the process. While the narrative isn't quite as focused as I'd hoped for in certain aspects, the film itself is still superbly produced, finely acted, and presented extremely well on Blu-ray by the people at Paramount. With reference A/V quality, a very informative plethora of extra features, and only an SRP of $29.99 (meaning you could probably get it for at least half-ish price), Minority Report comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>2054, Washington D.C. After six years of experiments, Pre-Crime law enforcement - in which murderers are caught before they commit their crime, thanks to the aid of a trio of psychics - has been deemed a success and is on the verge of going national. The project is headed up by Lamar Burgess (Von Sydow) and his protandeacute;gandeacute;, John Anderton (Cruise) who - through this technology - have prevented any murders taking place in the capital for the last six years. Others aren't so convinced - chief among them, F.B.I agent Ed Witwer (Farrell), assigned to find flaws in the system. When one of the psychics - known as 'Pre-Cogs' - predicts that Anderton will commit murder, the former golden boy is forced to go on the run from a system that he helped create.<br />Neither Spielberg nor Cruise have a reputation for making really uncommercial films and Minority Report doesn't deviate radically from their respective career trajectories. It is - with the honourable exception of Schlinder's List - perhaps the darkest movie in Spielberg's catalogue to date. Certainly, it's the most adult orientated of his films. For the most part it is a very enjoyable and intelligent film, which shouldn't fail to entertain most audiences. I liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>After the commercial dissapointment of A.I Artificial Intelligence, Steven Spielberg's upcoming film Minority Report is set in more traditional Science Fiction territory. This is Future-Noir at it's most inventive, with futuristic settings and amzing visuals. Tom Cruise, in his 25th film, is in superb form as the Pre-Crime agent who is on the run from his own people for a murder he hasn't commited (yet?). And the strong supporting cast of veteran Max Von Sydow and Colin Farrell gives added gravitas. The not-so-far away appearance of the system gives the film chilling realism. And this, more than anything else, is what gives the film it's kudos, for using a method of "futuristic" crimework that is completley believable. The action set-pieces and FX are absolutley amazing and the dark tone adds some well-played suspensful scenes, involving some creepy CGI creations. Building up to a tense and inpredictable climax, this is truly a great Sci Fi film that's up there with ground-breaking films like Blade Runner. Bravo, Mr Spielberg, bravo.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg misses the mark again for me here. It was a little disappointing to me but I gave it an even rating because I thought its production design was incredible. It is a great movie to look at. The technology and the promise of a future where we survive, make this an interesting film. This movie was far more interesting that his last project AI. Just to put things in perspective &#65533; my favorite Spielberg films are (and they are in no order), Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E.T. Schindler&#65533;s List, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Always and Saving Private Ryan.<p>Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. Not much of a stretch for him and not of lot of originality. (He was much better in Risky Business and All The Right Moves.) All the other supporting cast we kind of flat, but again, the technology was incredible. Display screens, holograms, electronic spiders and ore.<p>Basically the premise is that three people using telepathy can predict murders and the murderers &#65533; before they kill. They are then arrested and put in hibernation. The problem is that Tom&#65533;s character learns info that starts this race against time.<p>The most interesting character and the most dynamic performer came from Lois Smith. She played the inventor of the software and system that allows the psychics to do what they do. She seemed to have a lot of fun with Tom.<p>This is a matinee type of film or wait for the video release &#65533; but the production design is what stands out. Take a chance if you have nothing better to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I guess I am in the Minority.<br /><br />I am not a Tom Cruise fan at all. And  with such a great story at the core of the film, it should have been used as the sequel to TOTAL  RECALL. Personally I would have liked to have seen  Arnie, or at the Very Least Paul Verhoeven, do this story in their  own way.<br /><br />Visually nice, and Tom Cruise do not a good film make.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>It only gets worse.

Tom Cruise has a baby (and loses him) by natural means. Get IT??? Robo-spiders examine your eyeballs to see if you are an outlaw! Get IT???? Me neither.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>Tom really has great looks it's just to bad that with each passing film his acting gets worse.  I went to see this film knowing of the special effects which i always hate in movies but i did want to see Tom and see how this messures up to some of his other films. To me "Top Gun" is the only good film he ever made. As far as production value this film doesn't go anywhere and nothing ties it together except for Tom smiling, posing, and trying to look good and not get his hair to messed up.I've never been a big fan of Spielberg. He tries to hard all the time to make a good film and in my eyes doesn't have much success. Of course box office will always prove me wrong. But i don't think the american audience demands good acting pictures anymore and they count on special effects to pull them threw a movie which Spielberg is good at.I wasn't impressed but Tom is still good to look at. I wonder if he could make it on Broadway?</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Sleepwalking through yet another role Tom Cruise tries bravely to carry the movie on his back.  He's lying there in the hot sun moving his legs trying to turn over but he can't.  And the writer's aren't helping.<br />Whaddya mean they're not helping?<br />I mean they're not helping.<br />Apparently the movie is a test, designed to evoke an emotional response.  The emotion is ennui or malaise or boredom or apathy.  Get VKed on a film like this one and it's gonna be pretty hard to tell whether or not you're a replicant.  However there might be a certain involuntary dilation of the iris as you think of the five portraits of George Washington that are no longer in your hip pocket.<br />I would rate this movie Double-Plus Ungood.  Furthermore I would have the writers sent to the Ministry of Love and have them replaced by novel-writing machines.  But actually, come to think of it, it is entirely possible that Minority Report was written by machines - the literary equivalent of a Quisinart.  All you do is take the standard shlock Hollywood thriller plot formula, add in every old sci fi film you can think of, Metropolis, Blade Runner, Logan's Run, and some old Humphrey Bogart movie I forget the name of.  Hit the pulse button until these movies have been reduced to disjointed fragments, add an emulsifier and you can move out of Central and take the tubeway home early, just in time to feed your electric sheep.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Minority Report is my second favorite Science Fiction film, after Blade Runner. This is a great film with a complicated plot that twists and turns for 2.5 hours.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Tom Cruise and Max Von Sydow deliver the expected high level professional preformance. If you doubt Cruise's acting ability, look at the scene in which he searchers a crowded public pool for his missing son, frantically calling his son's name. Or watch the scene where the precog, Agatha, reveals the story of the life his missing son could have lived (and then in a great plot twist - we find out she is seeing not the life of the missing son but the life of the yet to be born son). Watch Cruise hang on her every word despite the pain he feels. Colin Farrel does a really good job of showing us a multi-layered personality. He first comes off as a smart-aleck Justice Department attorney conducting an investigation on a pilot program nearing completion. Then he reveals he is a former cop and we see him become more brawny as he fights Cruise in an automobile factory. The viewer is pulled for loyalty between the fugitive Cruise, whom we think is innocent, and the ambitious newcomer Agent Witwer who reveals to us scene by scene a man of competence and justice seeking truth. It is when the viewer fully realizes that Agent Witwer is actually an upright guy, that he is most in danger of falling victim to the dark forces of Washington policy masters.Samatha Morton does a great job of playing Agatha, gradually coming out of her coma and revealing past, present, future to an endangered man who may help reveal the crime and criminal behind her mother's death.<br /><br />Never underestimate Phillip K. Dick. In "Bladerunner" he was able to construct a great science fiction story around existentialism. In "Minority Report" he resurrects the ancient Oracles of Delphi and builds an action packed story around Free Will and Determinism. It is a strength of this film that at multiple points, the characters are faced with a decision that appears to be foretold but which is still in play. Agatha, the precog, whispers "you can choose" at the most critical of these points and the film firmly supports that we as humans can exert our free will but within a deterministic context.  Cruise selects not to kill Leo Crow, the criminal who supposedly kidnapped and killed his son, even though all the precognitions reveal an image in which it appears that he does kill Leo. This is the point in which he exerts his free will, his freedom to chose his course of action, and yet we also see how a structured deterministic world still confines that choice. However once the choice is made, a new future of causative links unfolds and the consequences for freedom take their path.  Phillip K. Dick creates a world for us here in which we see that freedom of choice and pre-ordained determinism co-exist and that the consciousness of a good man makes all the difference.<br /><br />Two final comments on the technology of the future: first, the film rightly shows that customer consumer patterns will become so tailored that marketers will be  able to show you exactly what you are looking for before you aware you are looking. Also, the criminal files contained in the precognitive visions were fascinating as both Cruise and Farrell pulled them across the screen for analysis. But, they were essentially images pulled across the desktop of the future, much like we pull documents from a file as we sit at our desks today.<br /><br />Good acting, witty and suspenseful, intelligent and complicated plot, philosophical underpinning, and fantastic art direction and special effects all come together to make Minority Report an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>You'll enjoy this stylish blend of sci-fi and film noir if you're willing to suspend your disbelief at the door. Many have decried the illogical holes in Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's otherwise excellent screenplay, but in the end these deficiencies hardly matter. Movies dealing with predestination never answer the big questions effectively - they just use them as the springboard for a story. And "Minority Report" tells a pretty good one, even if it does reveal where it's going too soon and is occasionally marred by Spielberg's trademark mawkishness. Tom Cruise is hugely enjoyable as the frantic John Anderton, and Colin Farrell does a fine job of making you hate Detective Witwer. It looks great, sounds great, holds your attention for all 147 minutes, and will even have you giggling at the spectacular product placements and some unexpected comedy. It's a respectful (if not faithful) adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story, too, so fans of the original should be pleased - although Act 3 does see the writers wandering into Hollywood-ending territory and has Spielberg wrapping things up on a typically optimistic false note. Still, it's refreshing to see a bunch of filmmakers tackling a sci-fi adaptation seriously and successfully while still keeping an eye on the box-office. If you're going to spend close to $100 million on a sci-fi project - and, let's face it, these days you have to - then you also have to consider the return. The result is a memorable film that strikes a savvy balance between deep thought and commercial appeal. "A.I" flopped because it glorified the former and "The Time Machine" failed by pandering to the latter. "Minority Report" wisely walks the middle-path. It won't have enough explosions to thrill die-hard action fans, nor quite enough depth to really please sci-fi devotees. But for the rest of us, it works.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>&quot;Minority Report,&quot; which works as a mystery, a sci-fi film and a pretty damn exciting adventure film, one of the best films of 2002. It is, at different points, thrilling, creepy, funny, confusing and inspired. <p>The acting is great, for Tom Cruise, in some of the scenes mourning his son, escapes his usual bravado to show some of that talent he so rarely gets to show in an action film. Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton and, particularly, the scene-stealing, brilliant Lois Smith also give compelling, supporting performances. <p>The plot is labyrinth, and the payoff is, for the most part, rewarding, though the ending could've been a bit less conventional. (Why, after such a wacky ride of a movie, are we left with a chase through the annals of a hotel? And what is with that ultra-happy ending? I hear there's a theory that part's all faked, but I think that theory's a result of some disappointed moviegoers.)<p>My main complaint with the DVD packaging is the extra supplemental disc. Why create a whole second disc and put so little compelling information on it? The documentary is, mostly, Cruise and Spielberg patting themselves and each other on the back. It doesn't delve too much into the actual crafting of the movie's plot or story. It just presents it, point blank, as &quot;We wanted to work together, and we found this script.&quot; The mechanics behind the film are inspired, and I wanted to know more. I wanted commentary tracks. I wanted how-to stories about the plausibility of the future gadgets. I got a 20-minute movie about how brilliant Spielberg is. I got a four-page essay on the film work of Tom Cruise, which I already knew about.<p>I love the movie. Give me the good stuff about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<p> On paper the teaming of Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise for Minority Report, a movie based upon a Philip K Dick short story, looks a sure-fire winner but then so did Vanilla Sky. The problem is movies aren&#65533;t made on paper but whereas Vanilla Sky was a great disappointment, thankfully, this is not the case with the excellent (but very cold) futuristic noir thriller Minority Report.<p>As previously mentioned, Minority Report is based on a Phillip K Dick short story and is similar in tone to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which was subsequently made into the rather excellent cult classic, and benchmark for all subsequent sci-fi movies, BladeRunner. Set only 52 years in the future, Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, a driven cop with a self-medicating drug habit, still haunted by the abduction and disappearance of his son, whilst in his care, at a public swimming pool five years previously. Anderton is chief of the Washington DC Pre-Crime police unit, whose SWAT teams stop murders before they can be committed by swooping down from the heavens and arresting the future perpetrators before they can carry out their intended crimes. <p>Pre-crime is reliant upon the visionary powers of three "pre-cogs"; apparent mutated shadows of human beings, interconnected by computer whilst floating in a tank of water, in a semi-comatose state, at police headquarters. Their dream-like premonitions are displayed on a giant screen, the images conducted and deciphered by a cyber-gloved Cruise, as coloured wooden balls bearing the name of both the prospective victim and perpetrator, roll down plastic tubes like this weeks &#65533;winning&#65533; lottery numbers. There is no apparent debate about civil liberties because the pre-cogs are never wrong, nobody gets hurt and the capital&#65533;s murder rate is down to zero, making it a very desirable system for federal law enforcers. The pre-crime system is almost ready to go national. However, just when everything seems to be going swimmingly Detective Anderton&#65533;s balls drop (down the plastic tube that is), as the pre-cognitives identify him as a future murderer in a vision on the big screen. As he's in charge and convinced the premonition is fake, he has the opportunity to go on the run in order to prove his innocence, an opportunity denied to every person he's arrested for the past six years. <p>Minority Report is an excellent and exhilarating ride into the future, full of action, suspense, FX and more twists and turns than a country road. Spielberg&#65533;s collaboration with the late great Stanley Kubrick (on A.I.) has obviously left an impression in that Minority Report has a distinctly Kubrickian cold alienation about it. In many ways it looks and feels very un-like a Spielberg movie except for the Hitchockian (or Spielbergian if you like) type suspense and mass of product placement (from Gap to Bulgari and Guinness). It is also very much unlike any previous Tom Cruise vehicle, which is refreshing, although some parallels in the action sequences could obviously be drawn to the Mission Impossible movies. However both Spielberg and Cruise are on top form here, ably supported by Max Von Sydow and an all too smooth Colin Farrell (Tigerland) and a virtually unrecognisable Samantha Morton (Sweet and Lowdown). Much credit should also go to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and Scott Farrar, visual effects supervisor from Industrial Light and Magic, who helped make Minority Report a work of art. <p>Intelligent, very entertaining, ingenious and dark. Minority Report is another great success to add to Mr Spielberg&#65533;s and Mr Cruise&#65533;s very impressive CV&#65533;s. 4.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief of the Precrimes Unit in Washington, D.C. in the year 2053. The unit has abolished murder in their city with the aid of three "precogs" who can see the crimes before they happen. Police arrest the suspect based on the visions and the prisoner's are put into suspended animation immediately. The "trial" each receives is apparently limited to their appearance in the precog visions. Anderton believes in the system wholeheartedly and is proud of the results. Just after he learns of odd discrepancies in a few cases, however, the precogs have a vision that implicates him in the murder of a man he's never heard of. Anderton makes a run for it to try and prove his innocence. The rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride as he tries to escape from the police while uncovering the real villain.<br /><br />Minority Report is a mixed bag of a movie. The action sequences are all exciting and Cruise conveys enough urgency that it goes a long way toward carrying the film. At the same time, the plot suffers from numerous holes and inconsistencies. For example, the precogs can only see a murder when the killer forms the intent. But Anderton's murder is predicted even though he knows nothing about the victim and certainly has no intention of killing him.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Minority Report. It's well produced and Cruise's energy and passion in the role help show once again why he's a major star. The story doesn't hold up very well to even casual analysis so you need to be prepared to just let that slide or skip the movie completely.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>One of the smartest movies to come out in 2002, `Minority Report' is a film that dazzles and frazzles me every time I sit down to watch it.  As many of my friends know, I am not a fan of Tom Cruise.  I think he's a highly overrated actor who receives far too much attention and praise for his own good, but I've always said that he knows how to pick a movie.  A lot of my favorite films (`Eyes Wide Shut', `Minority Report', `Vanilla Sky' & any of the `Mission Impossible' films just to mention a few) are Tom Cruise Vehicles.  This film is no exception, but here Tom is far outweighed by the strength of his co-stars Samantha Morton and the new kid on the block Colin Farrell.<br /><br />The premise takes place in the not so distant future of 2054 when crime is all but non-existent because of a new `precrime' division of local law.  This division is spearheaded by John Anderton (Cruise), a man haunted by the disappearance of his son six years prior and is now determined to make sure nothing like that ever happens again.  Relying on the premonitions of three `pre-cogs' (three children born to drug addicts who suffer from a horrible gift enabling them to see murders before they actually happen), this team has been able to all but eradicate murder as a whole.<br /><br />Just as the morals and accuracy of the project are brought into question by Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) it appears the pre-cogs predict that John himself is to murder a man he's never met.  This catapults John into a game of cat and mouse as he tries to prove his innocence while uncovering a strange murder that pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) keeps seeing over and over.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's direction here is fantastic.  Visually this movie is stunning from start to finish, and plot-wise this is a film that will keep you intrigued and involved.  Samantha Morton is stunning as usual, completely stealing every scene she's in and becoming her character mind, body and soul.  Colin Farrell makes a fine breakout here, stealing scene after scene from Cruise and proving to be the more charismatic and entertaining actor of the two.  Max von Sydow also pulls out a nice little performance as the ambiguous Lamar Burgess, mentor to the now troubled John.  It was also nice to see Kathryn Morris (of `Cold Case' fame) here as Lara, John's ex-wife.  It's not that Tom is awful here, he actually pulls out a nice performance, but he's easily overshadowed by the finer actors (Morton in particular who dominates everyone of her scenes) and just continues to shock me with his constant undue praise.<br /><br />Overall `Minority Report' is one of the best films of 2002, visually, intellectually and entertaining-wise.  It's a complete joyride from start to finish despite Tom and is well worth multiple viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Years before Voice-Stress Analyzer, routine polygraphs, and personality profiles, Phillip K. Dick asked the interesting question: Is intent to commit the crime automatic guilt? In Minority Report, Pre-Crime anticipates the offense and stops the crimes before they happen.....or do they??? Would it always, always and without exception, have played out as anticipated? Tom Cruise, framed and put in a position where he'll have an irresistible urge to kill, is told by the PreCog that he can still choose and begins to wonder. A frightening vision of a possible future, and great entertainment. Highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>In the past, Spielberg was well-known for delivering two kinds of movie:  the (often sappy) feel-good movie like &quot;E.T.&quot; and the dark, devastating film like &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  Lately, he has begun to mature as a director/producer with offerings that give the viewer more variety.  &quot;Minority Report&quot; is one of those films.  Set in the future that is recognizable just as often as it is not, Spielberg adds comedy to desperation, heart-felt grief to adventure, accident to calculated science.<p>The gist of the movie can be explained simply.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Pre-Crime, a police experiment that results in a murder-free Washington, D.C.  The secret behind the success of Pre-Crime is three &quot;pre-cogs&quot; who foresee murder before it happens, giving the police time to intervene.  When the pre-cogs finger John himself as a premeditated murderer even though he does not even know the supposed victim, he realizes his only hope is to run.<p>Although the special effects are interesting, they sometimes clutter a movie that is, after all, about predestination, exploitation, and the meaning of innocence.  We don't need a fantastical future to feel these themes.  While the futuristic cars and their highways are cool, a greenhouse of bizarre botanical specimens is too much, even to point out how far the geneticists of the future succeed in their quest to manipulate life.  The comedy in some of the darkest scenes works well as both relief and set-up of greater tension.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; contains some major holes, but all in all, comes off as an entertaining and, more importantly, original story. The characterization is surprisingly detailed for a sci-fi adventure, creating a future that feels more truthfully human than I expected.  The acting is generally solid, and the cinematography often above-average.  My biggest complaint about the DVD specifically was the quality of the sound - it never exploited the capabilities of my surround-sound system and often sounded dull.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; is an excellent choice for both teens and adults, especially for those who like a thrill with their flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>&quot;Is it now?&quot; a dazed seer asks Tom Cruise's rogue cop in &quot;Minority Report.&quot; Viewers may well wonder the same thing during the sensational DVD presentation of Steven Spielberg's futuristic film noir.<p>The movie itself coolly transports viewers to a world 52 years ahead -- Spielberg's paranoid vision of life in the nation's capital seems not only possible, but probable at times. <p>Then there are the filmmaking techniques demonstrated on the DVD by the director's effects visionaries -- so cutting edge and visually startling that they seem right out of the movie itself.<p>The first disc (dual layer) contains only the film, no director's commentary. Director Spielberg has his say on the second (single layer) disc, which has a generous selection of bonus materials that are well organized and to the point.

Blacks seem devoid of light, full of despair. The cobalt blues saturate the images, evoking the specter of a locked-and-loaded police state. <p>The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound are typical of Spielberg's DVDs, with an upfront bias and subdued directional effects. The chilling subwoofer bottom keeps listeners on edge.<p>The featurette compilation opens and closes with Spielberg and Cruise exchanging superlatives (the package actually has a beginning, middle and end). Spielberg talks about how &quot;A.I.&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot; fit into his midlife vision quest. The director explains his &quot;dirty, ugly&quot; take on the future of U.S. society.<p>Wisely, most of the extras focus on the effects wizards and craftsmen who realized this future world. DVD content specialist Laurent Bouzereau keeps the featurettes moving along, with little time for the specialists to become tangled up in their thoughts. Fast-paced editing keeps the screen shots and on-set clips fresh.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This movie starts fast and quickly immerses the viewer in a very strange world with dialog and action that blazes along making it difficult to keep up. The important thing is to hang in there and the pieces will all start to fit together. The movie is based on a novella by Philip K. Dick who is known for his highly original imagination and who has come up with ideas for stories unlike anyone else. This is another one of those original story lines and takes the viewer on a wild ride.<br /><br />Fortunately the pieces begin to all fit together and do so with dramatic use of the surround speakers and plenty of action on screen. The basic premise of the movie is a technology has developed that permits the viewing of a crime before it actually happens so police can step in and stop the crime before it has taken place. Just as this system of crime prevention is ready to go nationwide something happens that changes everything. The Tom Cruise character, a policeman named John Anderton, is suddenly plunged into a situation that threatens his very life.<br /><br />He must now use the crime prevention system called Precrime to find out the truth and discover who is out to frame him. His search for the truth provides the basis for this exciting action movie.<br /><br />I encourage the viewer to give the movie a chance because although at first it might seem confusing it quickly shapes up into a good sci-fi adventure movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>Minority Report definitely ranks as one of the best future-theme movies of all time. Although not as groundbreaking as The Matrix or visually stunning as Blade Runner, it has it's own pro's.<p>In a future where future crimes are predicted using triplets or 'Pre Cogs' with the ability to foresee events yet to come, the Police Officer in charge and support of the device himself (Tom Cruise) is accused of a murder that he has yet to commit. Though he believes that he is innocent, the squad doesn't, so Cruise sets out on his journey to find the truth.<p>The storyline for the movie is interesting, very thought provoking. A lot of what is talked about sounds complicated at first, but listening closely will reveal that they are really talking about the Minority Report of Cruise. Listen even more closely and you'll understand the entire movie, otherwise you will be lost.<p>Good actors playing good characters, impressive special effects, quality action, and a deepening plot - Minority Report is definitely worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>I loved Minority Report. The movie had me hooked early and took me on a fantastic ride.<p>The story is complex but in one short paragrah I'll tell a little bit about it. John Anderton(Tom Cruise) is the chief of Pre-Crime in Washington D.C. and is accused of future murder. The movie then goes on a wild goose chase where he is trying to prove he didn't do it.<p>Tom Cruise is outstanding in the movie. This is one of his greatest performances of all time. He plays the character well. You feel for John Anderton as you see the movie unwind. You feel for him because of the fine acting that Cruise does.<p>Colin Farrel is good in the movie aswell. He plays Danny Whitmore a federal agent is trying to see if pre-crime works. He ends up chasing Anderton in the movie. He plays the character so well. Farrel does such a good job of making you hate him. I love that kind of stuff.<p>The special effects in the movie are some of the best all time. They bring out some scary ideas in the movie that could be possible some time in the future.<p>Roger Ebert said &quot;Minority Report reminds us of why we go to the movies&quot; and I couldn't agree any more. This is a cinematic masterpiece and a must own to any DVD collection.</p></br></body></html>

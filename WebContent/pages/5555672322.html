This is not because of the 3D effects, it is that there are more enjoyable characters and more murders to watch. I was lucky enough to see this in 3D at the cinemas back in 1983, and these effects added value to an already good sequel.<br /><br />There are many reviews here stating how bad the 3D is which has been presented on the new deluxe DVD. In a nutshell, it is. There are odd moments of acceptability, but essentially it is dismal. This could be because the 3D technology used way back in 1982 does not work well on today's viewing monitors. I watched it on a 40" LCD TV, maybe LCD is what stuffs it up. The red/blue glasses don't help the experience either. They make your eyes feel weird and you can suffer headaches as a result. However, these type of glasses are necessary to view 3D films of that era. Simply put, you can't use modern 3D glasses (i.e. black lenses) to watch old time 3D movies.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, when objects come out of the screen in Friday the 13th Part 3, as part of the 3D effect, it just looks terrible. It blurs and the effect is lost. It may be worth trying to watch the DVD on your computer or a smaller screen to see if it resolves it. Also, the red/blue glasses give the overall picture a tint which makes the film unrealistic.<br /><br />I'm not sure if you can blame Paramount for any of the issues with this 3D movie being transferred to DVD.  As I said, there are the odd few scenes where the 3D effect works well, but overall it is no fun to watch. I understand Paramount have been hassled for years to release the 3D version on DVD but declined - possibly for all the problems I have listed above. That is probably why the original DVD of this movie came with the 2D version.<br /><br />So is it worth buying this DVD? Well, the disc does come with the 2D version which is nicely cleaned up. BUT, the remixed 5.1 sound is nothing to rave about, and most of the noise still comes out of the one speaker (like the original DVD). There are no special features except for a trailer and two sets of 3D glasses.<br /><br />Save your money, and stick with your original DVD. You've been warned!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D is one of those films that scared me when I was bout 4. I mean a guy in a hockey mask chasing you in the woods? The film wa shot in 3D and features some cool scenes, nudity etc. These films aren't made to be Oscar worthy they are made to be fun and that what this is now that I'm 26 it's still a fun movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Some reviewers correctly stated that this doesn't look great on a lcd tv. But then this is not the current 3d format that uses shutter glasses. Like my new panasonic vt50 uses. This is the green red anaglypth glasses. This needs to be re released unto a proper 3d disc like they are doing for 'jaws 3d" from the same year.  The movie is one of the better in the friday the  13th series and they have dropped the ball in releasing the rest of the series for some reason. Still getting this in any 3d format at all in 2009 was a good thing. if only they'd have waited just one year later and the great 3d format was out. Oh well. You could watch this in 2d and make it 3d with your 3d tv but it won't look as good as it did at the theater for sure.  A re release is needed along with a release of the rest of the series.  THe picture looks great though and that is a good thing.  Jason puts on the mask for the first time here and that another interesting fact. This is worth owning , but like I said , lets have a re-release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>After part 2, Jason Voorhees (Richard Booker) is still on the loose as he has gotten some new clothes and murdered a couple of kind store owners. Rich girl Chris (Dana Kimmel) with friends like prankster Shelly (Larry Zerner), Debbie (Tracie Savage), Vera (Catherine Parks), Andy (Jeffery Rogers), Chili (Rachel Howard) and Chuck (David Katims) are off on a sexual holiday at a cottage resort called "Higgin's Haven". But unfortunately she had a bad experience there once even involving an encounter with Jason as she will face her fear since he kills her friends.<br /><br />Very gory and entertaining entry of the very cool Friday The 13th saga! this is the movie that finally introduced audiences to his trademark goalie mask that re-established him. Steve Miner who directed part 2 did a fantastic job on bringing this installment in 3D with humor, shocks, gore, and decent acting making this one of the highest grossing movies of the series at the box-office in 1982, it's a winner.<br /><br />This blu-ray offers excellent picture and sound with both 3D and 2D versions of the film with 3D glasses and cool extras like slasher film featurette, Lost Tales of Camp Blood part 3 short, legacy of the mask featurette, Fresh-Cuts: 3D terror featurette and trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>1982 saw the release of the third Friday the 13th movie, which was presented in 3D. The DVD now comes with a pair of 3D glasses, but I watched the standard version...I just don't really care. None of the "Friday" films can be called masterpieces and part 3 isn't much different from it's predecessors, but it's the weakest of the first three films as a result of low-quality acting, dialogue, and story.<br /><br />The first seven minutes serve as a recap of the last film and then we meet characters who we all know will be quickly dispatched by Jason so we can meet all the main characters. Returning director Steve Miner piles on the cheap scares leading up to Jason's first kill.<br /><br />Next we meet a large number of college kids heading out to a cabin in the woods for a weekend stay. Of course, Jason is already awaiting their arrival.<br /><br />No further description of the plot is needed; you all know what happens next. Part 3, as I said, does not differ much from the previous entries...22 minutes into the film we get the stereotypical old man character that warns the kids about the doom that awaits them.<br /><br />There are more problems with it. All of the actors are inexperienced and that's obvious. No one gave an Oscar-caliber performance in the other films either, but here...The actors seem shy and awkward. The dialogue and the delivery of it is atrocious. As if that's not bad enough, the movie has two stoner characters that are completely out of place. They both look about 10 years older than the others and their presence makes no sense.<br /><br />This, however, is the installment where Jason (played by Richard Brooker this time around) got his iconic hockey mask. Good thing too as Jason looks more funny than frightening without it.<br /><br />Most of my complaints about the movie are common for a slasher film. The whole concept of a slasher film is for a group of people to be systematically killed in interesting ways by some maniac, so why does dialogue and acting matter? Well, really, it doesn't. But I just don't see any of the actors, writers, or director having much passion for this project. It seems like they all just wanted to get it over with. It is that factor that makes this the weakest "Friday" up to this point.<br /><br />Luckily, "Friday the 13th: Part Three" does have it's moments of suspense and, for all it's faults, is entertaining. It's not a complete pile of garbage, but there's nothing impressive here.<br /><br />GRADE: C</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>Part 3 of Friday the 13th - this is also a good offering as were parts 1 and 2. I have always thought the first 3 were really the best & got worse after Part 3. More dumb teenagers go to Camp Crystal Lake and Jason hacks them all off one by one. There is no one to root for but Jason. Characters are goofy or just dumb. The suspense/scary moments were plentiful. Gore and nudity as usual. There is even a shower sequence (a nod to Psycho ?)<br />The DVD can be seen in 2D and 3D. So far I watched it in 2D - the 2D print was kind of grainy for the first 18 minutes but was ok from there.<br />When I see it in 3D ill add to my review...so right at this moment I can say this film is still part of the good early ones and recommended to any Friday the 13th fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Some fans name this as their favorite Friday the 13th film - but I'm not one of them.  Sure, Jason finally gets the hockey mask and really gets his slashing groove on, but there's no denying the fact that the silliness factor that marred the series as a whole began here.  Dope-smoking hippies and the world's worst and dweebiest practical joker definitely lowered my expectations early on, and the whole deal with opening the movie with an extended flashback of the climactic moments of the last film had already gotten old (plus, in this case, those events really have very little to do with the story as it unfolds here), so I was in a three-star mood about halfway through the action.  Jason really stepped up to the plate, though, delivering some pretty cool kills.  Maybe, just maybe, I might have been tempted to go all the way up to five stars if this were the original 3-D version released in theaters, but it's not (the 3-D version is apparently available only in Japan) - but I doubt it because I have a few issues with the film's blood and gore.  Regrettably, the film's best blood and gore had to be edited out in order to avoid an X rating, which is just silly.  Then you have the fact that two of the murders feature some of the fakest special effects you're likely to see.  As it is, I give the film four stars - thanks largely to Jason's standout work.<br /><br />Having escaped an attack from a deformed, mad killer a year earlier, Christy (Dana Kimmell) comes back to the property to prove something to herself, but all she really proves is that she's an idiot.  Of course, she's apparently oblivious to the fact that Jason had just killed a gaggle of camp counselors the day before (although her old boyfriend Rick, being a local, certainly should have heard something about it).  Personally, though, if I ever drive up on an old coot sleeping in the middle of the road who proceeds to get up, shove a fresh human eyeball in my face, and warn me to go back where I came from, I'm turning around, brother.  Of course, all of Christy's friends are either too young or too stoned to worry about their mortality, especially when there's sex to be had just down the road.<br /><br />So, basically, Jason has decided to hide out in a barn near Higgins Haven (and, despite what should be a massive manhunt for yesterday's Crystal Lake massacre killer, no cop even shows up to peruse the nearby lakeside property).  Upon arrival, Christy and her friends go into basic slasher film mode - with some hooking up, some getting high, and some taking a drive so that they can arrive back home right after Jason has killed all of their friends.  You know the drill.  This time around, the designated oddball is Shelly (Larry Zerner); not being the best-looking fellow around (not by a long shot), he keeps trying to impress the ladies by playing stupid practical jokes (as if the old machete-in-the-head joke ever impressed a woman anywhere on the face of the earth).  At one point, he even sports a wetsuit, underwater harpoon spear (huh?), and - wait for it - a hockey mask.<br /><br />I believe this film was originally intended to be the final film in the series.  That is the only rationale I can come up with to explain the conclusion, which I found worthy of a few boos.  Not only are there some logistical problems involved with the whole idea, its payoff moment is of a distinctly "been there, done that" nature that pretty much backfires, in my opinion.  You can't call the same trick play two out of three downs and expect it to work both times.  Thankfully, the film made more money than its predecessors, paving the way for more Jason-style blood and mayhem in the years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>First let me say this film is very nostalgic to me. I was fortunate enough to see it in its original theatrical 3-D release. I remember the credits coming out at you in 3-D. As a kid, It was a thrill for me, scary and exciting. Part 3 is my favorite film out of  11 Jason films. I had read this was the most profitable 3-D theatrical release ever. That may have changed with the new onslaught of 3-D movies. While we are at it, My Bloody Valentine 3D was loads of fun!<br />I almost fell out of my chair when I read this Friday the 13th was being released as a special version. I went out immediately and bought it. I must say this DVD must be making some money because many stores had sold out of it, but had plenty of the other 2 special releases in stock. I finally snagged the last copy from Best Buy.<br />My favorite part of the film was the 3-D opening credits. I am even one of those rare birds that dig the theme song. I even own the theme song. It was written by Harry Manfredini under the name of Hot Ice.<br />I am really let down by the opening credits not being in 3-D. Why? I cannot understand this glaring omission. I skimmed through the movie to see how effective the 3-D effects were.<br />Here is a rundown of some of the effects (but not all of them):<br /><br />The first noticeable effect was the laundry pole being handled by Harold. It literally came out right in front of my face. Excellent.<br /><br />The snake in the rabbit cage. Not so good. I saw 2 snakes. (there should only be one)<br /><br />Passing the joint in the van: again I saw double vision here. Not so good.<br /><br />The bum holding the eyeball up to the camera. This time it worked excellent.<br /><br />Lifting the hay into the barn and the hay swaying back and forth on the rope was good. Again this worked great. The depth was excellent, almost dizzying.<br /><br />The fist through the car glass. Not so good.<br /><br />The yo-yo scene: the first part wasn't working but the last few swings really did came straight out of the screen.<br /><br />The gas siphon scene seemed to have perfect clarity and amazing depth. The whole film should have looked like this.<br /><br />The two thugs getting a pitchfork in the barn. Only average here. Could have been better. But the pitchfork handle did come out of the screen.<br /><br />The juggling scene. It was effective. Not bad but not great. The room depth was good here.<br /><br />Kris telling about her encounter with Jason. Her head seemed to float around while the story played in the background behind her. This was good. I don't even remember this scene being in 3-D.<br /><br />The harpoon in the eye scene did not seem to work to well for me. I tried it several times. This was suppose to be the highlight effect of the film. It just happened so fast.<br /><br />The popcorn worked. I think it would work better on a bigger screen.<br /><br />The hippy getting electrocuted; the sparks flew out of the screen, very cool.<br /><br />Effects that did not work. The female hippy with the fire poker through her. And the boy doing the hand stand and getting a machete in his hoo hoo, neither of these had much effect.<br /><br />The eyeball popping out of the head. This was funny, because when the eyeball pops out, you can hear a horn beep. Like a horn at the end of a joke by Groucho Marx. I don't remember the horn noise LOL. Oh and yes the eyeball scene worked very well.<br /><br />Other minor effects: Jason throws a knife at Chris. Jason plummets through the front porch and grabs at Kris.<br /><br />Jason being hung. This worked well as far as the depth. The rope seemed to be on the outside of the screen.<br /><br />Jason getting the meat cleaver in the head and putting his hands out to the camera. Worked excellent, very exciting!<br /><br />All in all it is kind of a headache watching this thing. But I thought the sound was of a much better quality than the earlier Friday Part 3 DVD I have. I really didn't get the ending where Jason's mother pops up out of the water, but hey what part of the movie is realistic anyway? I am glad to have this. Maybe we will get a better version with the opening credits.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Steve Miner, who directed the lackluster second installment of the Friday the 13th franchise, returned to the director's chair for this third installment, originally filmed in 3-D which would explain the never ending slew of eyeballs, pitchforks, harpoons, yo-yo's, popcorn, snakes, that are thrown directly in the viewer's direction.  The acting is as crummy as crummy can be, but this installment offers the goods: good looking babes who get down and dirty, and some great blood and gore effects.  This may feature some of the most brutal killings in the series until Jason Goes to Hell came along, but this installment is pivotal for one reason: Jason finally ditches his potato sack and dons the trademark hockey mask.  All in all, Friday the 13th Part 3 is better than the preceding Part 2, and would set the stage for what I feel is the best film in the series: Friday the 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>After part 2, Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) is still on the loose as he's gotten new clothes and murdered a couple of store owners. Rich girl Chris (Dana Kimmell) with prankster Shelly (Larry Zerner), Andy (Jeffery Rogers), Chuck (David Katims), Vera (Catherine Parks), Debbie (Tracie Savage) and Chili (Rachel Howard) are having a sexual holiday at a cottage by the lake called Higgins Haven. Chris unfortunately remembers two years ago that she was attacked by Jason Voorhees but luckily survived and has now returned back to the place to get rid of her bad memories, however the vicious maniac wants blood including hers.<br /><br />A Gory and solid entry of the way too cool Friday The 13th franchise! This is the movie that finally gave Jason a mask and it's his trademark hockey mask that established him. Steve Miner who directed part 2 does a superb job on this entry with scares, shocks, graphic gore like a guy getting his head crushed until his eye pops out, and of course decent acting. I think this one really brings the series growing high and made a big enough fortune in August 13 of 1982 and did a nice job of giving us Jason in his hockeymask and the ending is quite scary as well.<br /><br />This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with only one extra which is a theatrical trailer and of course for the first time in 27 years the original 3D version of the film complete with two pairs of 3D glasses and the 2D version.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Even though this begins right after the end of part 2, Jason seems to have grown about twice the size he was in that film.  He's also now completely bald, he seems to have lost all of his hair in that half hour time frame.  The disco theme is pretty catchy, and the 3D thing looks quite dumb.  It would be nice if the dvd came with glasses and the film was in 3D.  When the van full of victims pulls up(as it always seems to in these the beginning of these films.  They might as well have an announcer say, "Lets meet our victims, ladies and gentlemen"), you will identify almost immediately who the lucky one is who'll survive.  That point is pounded home even more when she refuses the advances of her old boyfriend.  And of course, as you probably already know, Jason gets his hands on that hockey mask in this one, and he must love it, coz he's never without it again.  In fact, he manages to get it back after losing it a few times, and even gets a brand new one in 8.  No different than the rest, but I have to admit that this one has what I feel to be the creepiest moment in the series.  These films are far from being scary, but there's a dream sequence at the end of this film that's pretty well done and might even give you the chills.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>It's hard to rate a film now that likely depended heavily on its effect in the theater.  Friday the 13th part 3 was released in the theater in 3-D.  3-D saw a popular revival in the early 1980s, so Steve Miner and Paramount Pictures wanted to follow-up his successful sequel to the original slasher film about Jason and his mom with a new sequel that could cash in even more.  It worked and Friday the 13th part 3 was a huge box-office success.  It grossed $36 million with a budget of $2.5 million.  Not too shabby.<br /><br />The same formula is here that exists in all of these films.  Part 3 takes place right after part 2.  Jason survives, grows a few inches and gains a few pounds and goes to a store where he changes into something more menacing than overalls.  He of course kills anything that might be alive along the way.  Jason waits in a barn unmasked and begins killing those who enter.  He eventually wanders out and obtains his iconic goalie mask.  Like any Friday the 13th film, it has gratuitous content but it is even more evident due to the fact that it is supposed to be in 3-D.  There are clearly some things that are intentionally meant to pop out at you but don't because the 3-D version is not available on DVD.  This insane girl Chris at the lakeside resort where Jason is killing all these people eventually chops Jason in the head and kills him.  In imitation of the first movie's big scare, she ends up in a canoe in the middle of the lake and Jason's mother's reassembled head and body leaps from the lake and drags her into the murky green deep.  It worked the first time in the first film, although that was even somewhat derivative.  It worked less so the second time in part 2 when Jason jumped through the window.  At this point, it isn't really that scary and how the hell did Pamela Voorhees sew her head back onto her body anyway?<br /><br />In Friday the 13th lore, there are rumors of an alternate ending which I think would've been far more appropriate and entertaining.  Instead of Chris dreaming Jason's mother jumps out of the lake, she dreams of Jason chopping off her head.  Part 3 really establishes the marketing drive behind these movies and Paramount took it and ran with it. It also established a Jason that was more worthy of audience cheers than screams.  Steve Miner had enough of this series and would not return for part 4.  I can see why, the series took a significant dive here and it would soon get worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>If Paramount's A-movie franchise was Star Trek, then their B-movie franchise would definitely be Friday The 13th. A total of eight were made and, with the exception of '83, there was a Friday The 13th for every year in the Eighties, with the TV series debuting in '87.<br /><br />They were tacky, badly made and infrequently showed any professionalism, or dynamic filmmaking. But they sure had their moments and Part 3 is definitely the best of the first four, Part 5 being the joker in the pack and 6-8 the second instalment of the Jason Voorhees legacy.<br />Copy picture<br /><br />Apparently, not getting enough of butchering teenagers with the first sequel, director Steve Miner returns for more unlucky day murders. While his first outing was almost the exact same as the original, only with a different killer, Part 3 reinvents the franchise and totally solidifies Jason as a horror movie icon.<br /><br />Chris (Dana Kimmel) has had a difficult past few years and she decides to spend a long weekend at Higgins Haven with her friends. Too bad for them that Jason (Richard Brooker) is lurking in the woods. He and Chris have had a scuffle in the past and she's afraid to go out there alone.<br /><br />Her friends are an unusual bunch. There are a couple of stoners, Shelly, a fat kid who just wants to be loved (Larry Zerner), a pregnant friend (Tracie Savage) and her hunky squeeze (Paul Kratka). These are not the typical goofball sex-mad teenagers of the early Eighties. For some reason, the writers have made them somewhat subdued and realistic. They seriously want a quiet weekend - no partying, no loud music. It helps that we like them, because in most other occasions we can't wait for them to get slaughtered.<br /><br />And they aren't the only ones in trouble. A non-threatening biker gang plan to cause havoc at Higgins Haven, because Shelly knocked over their scooters, and end up regretting it. If anything, they make for some light comedy - intentional, or not.<br /><br />Halfway through, Shelly pulls a joke on the girl he fancies. He leaps out of the water wearing a hockey mask and brandishing a harpoon. Five minutes later Jason gets his hands on them. And ever since, the image of the hockey mask has been the trademark of the series.<br /><br />In every other sequel, Jason is a walking monolith. He'd kick Freddy's ass, show Michael Myers a thing or two about the art of teenage massacre and somehow be able to maintain his cool and make it all seems effortless. This is the only time you will see him for what he really is - a retarded hillbilly. He evens smiles! Twice!!<br /><br />Miner would return later to the same location in Lake Placid. Here, he successfully portrays Crystal Lake as a tranquil, peaceful place and manages, in the final scenes, to infuse it with atmospheric excitement, all without the use of rain, or lightning.<br /><br />It wouldn't be hard to make a sequel superior to the original Friday The 13th. Miner failed with Part 2, but excels in Part 3. It has a lighter tone and different feel from the others. In fact, it shouldn't be viewed as a horror film at all. It's an adventure movie, set in the woods, with one of the best villains ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>Of all the Friday the 13th movies this one is my favorite of the series and would possibly make my top 50 favorite horror films. You know those movies you like a lot more than you should? Well Friday the 13th Part 3 is that movie for me. Sure this is your typical slasher flick with the typical horror movie characters, but there is just something about this movie I love.<br /><br />By this time a formula for what worked well with this franchise was found and the makers were sticking to it. Even with the knockoff films that were being released around the same time the early Friday the 13th movies were able to edge them out and be a lot better. The biggest thing this movie has going for it is; this is the first time Jason wore the famous hockey mask.<br /><br />Screenwriters Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson actually try and elevate the screenplay to be more than the typical stalk and slash movie. They seemed to have a few ideas, but it just wasn't quite there yet. I think this is one of the better written ones of the series, which granted isn't saying much, but Kitrosser and Watson do try and make more of the movie. There really isn't much in the way of plot, but than again this series isn't known for that. This one probably has the least amount of plot, but with that said is also has a little more than some of the others.<br /><br />The characters mostly lack any depth, but they do come across as real people and that helps make up for the lack of character development. There were some interesting ideas presented, but weren't explored enough. There was a back-story with the character Chris and how she encountered Jason a couple of years back. The concept seems like it's going to lead to something, but it never comes about. I did hear that an original idea was a sexual assault and if you pay close attention to the dialog early it does seem like that was a direction the movie was heading.<br /><br />But come a certain point the idea is dropped, which isn't a bad thing and we find out how Jason attacked her. Despite not really going anywhere it actually works in the favor of the movie and helped give Chris more depth. There was also a back-story with Rick and Chris, which normally in these movies feels very out of place, but it works rather well and adds some more depth to Chris and even a little bit for Rick that subplot could have been a disaster, but works well as does the story with Shelly and Vera; another one that could have been a disaster worked well.<br /><br />That is why I go back to the script having some decent ideas. Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson had some good ideas with the Chris character and overall they had a good idea with the movie. It seems like they had some interesting ideas, but never fully developed it. The script though is simple and that is what helps it work.<br /><br />Director Steve Miner is able to create plenty of atmosphere and looming dread; he manages to use his setting to his full advantage. In Friday the 13th Part II, Steve Miner very much followed what Sean Cunningham did with the original. In Friday the 13th Part III it seems he took some influence from John Carpenter. The shots of Jason watching and waiting to strike remind me a lot of Halloween; instead of being a carbon copy, Miner is also able to add his own style. While I liked what he did with Friday the 13th Part II, I felt he did much better here.<br /><br />Steve Miner has made some enjoyable movies, but the problem with him is he doesn't really have an original idea he mostly follows what other filmmakers do, and this time around I do think he owes a bit to John Carpenter, but he is able to at times inject a little bit of his own style. Steve Miner has done some fairly good work in his career and while he isn't an Icon of the genre he has done a little more than people might realize.<br /><br />Horror flicks work best when the characters are isolated and Miner gets the job done there. The pacing of the movie was done quite well. Once things slow down too much there is a shot of Jason, which helps keep the tension going strong. The kill scenes were effective and set up quite well done as well.<br /><br />As stated before the characters come across as real people and I think are all quite likable. Friday the 13th Part III features my favorite characters of the series and some of my favorites in a horror flick. To be honest this is one of the few horror movies where I liked all the characters.<br /><br />The acting wasn't bad either; what people seem to forget is this is a slasher movie Oscar worthy performances really wouldn't fit. The actors all do a fine job with their characters and come across as real people and that for me made me like the movie even more since when they died I felt bad for them.<br /><br />Dana Kimmell who played Chris was by far my favorite character of the series and quite honestly might be my favorite character in a horror movie. I really just loved her character. Chris made a very strong and likeable heroine, while vulnerable also stepped up and fought back with everything she had in her.<br /><br />Richard Brooker made an excellent Jason; he was big and strong but still had some human qualities to him. Richard Brooker is by far my favorite Jason. In my personal opinion Richard Brooker was by far the scariest Jason. I loved his movements and even at times his fun in killing and his frustration.<br /><br />The scene with the spear gun was a classic moment. There are two reasons for that. For starters it's the first time Jason appears with the mask on and 2nd after he kills Vera he just walks away like it was nothing. I found Richard Brooker very creepy at times.<br /><br />When it comes to horror movies the final act is so very important. A great horror movie could be ruined by it and an average horror movie could suddenly become much better cause of it. In my opinion the final act of Friday the 13th Part 3 just might be the most solid of the whole series. The first sequel had a good chase scene, but it was pretty much shot for shot the same thing as the first, even the way it was edited was the same.<br /><br />The overall atmosphere for the final chase between Chris and Jason can be quite creepy. We all know horror flicks work at their best when the characters are isolated in a certain area and when you only have the killer and the intended victim in the isolated area it's even better. What made it work so well wasn't just Steve Miner's directing, but Chris being vulnerable, but not too scared to fight back, and Jason was quite creepy. The barn scene when Jason can't find Chris and he starts getting frustrated was a great scene, which now might look out of place cause of what Jason has become. But back in 1982 this was only Jason's 2nd outing so it wasn't out of character.<br /><br />Friday the 13th Part 3 is far from perfect; make no mistake it does have its flaws. But it's also a well made slasher flick with a creepy villain and likable characters. Something some of the later installments didn't have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I'm sure it will be on at a local cinema again soon. My boyfriend thankfully saw it at the cinema in 3D, and explained why the credits and everything else seems to come towards the camera at random points in the film. However, it does work well in 2D, but it still would have been good to see it in 3D. There's some gory scenes that would have had you ducking in your seat.<br /><br />As much as I liked Friday 13 III, there are a few similarities to the previous movies. Able (the old man near the beginning) is much like Crazy Ralph from the first two films. It's a shame he only had a small part, cos Crazy Ralph's part was extended. Some of the other similar scenes include: Debbie seeing drops of blood falling from above, she looks up and a knife goes through her throat, almost exactly the same as Kevin Bacon's scene in the first film; after Chris thinks she had killed Jason she goes to sleep in a canoe on the lake much like Alice did in the first film; and when Chris awakes from the canoe Mrs. Voorhees comes out of the water and drags her under water much like what Jason did to Alice in Part 1.<br /><br />You actually see Jason smiling in this film, which is quite freaky. I didn't feel as sorry for him in this film as I did in the last (with his mother), but there are a couple of odd bits, which I ended up thinking about. I'm not sure whether my boyfriend gave me this impression, or the film did, but there is the idea that the reason why Jason didn't kill Chris is because she passed out, so he decided to rape her. And her parents never told her what happened while she was out. But I just don't think Jason has the mental capability to rape someone. Considering how young he "died", he probably didn't know about the "birds & the bees" then. But then my boyfriend thinks he did rape her. It's one of those puzzling aspects of this movie.<br /><br />The other puzzling thing about this movie (which I JUST worked out - how blonde am I?) is it's Friday 13th part 3 - but it's not actually SET on a Friday 13th. It actually takes place the day after the events of Part 2, making it Saturday the 14th. While the beginning of the movie takes place on the evening of Saturday the 14th, when the overweight store owner and his nagging wife are killed, the majority of the movie takes place on the following day, making it Sunday the 15th.<br /><br />From various reviews, I've heard this is the last "good" Friday 13th movie. (Apart from Freddy vs Jason, is that included?) If that's the case, I still have the rest to watch! The only thing I wasn't keen on in this was the recap from the previous Friday 13th. Yes, it's always good to have a little reminder, but at this point, you just want to get on with the new film. Hopefully, the rest of the movies won't be as bad as everyone says they are.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Friday The 13th 3 is my personal favorite. There's nothing new or different with this one, but it is still a pleasing slasher/horror film. There is no plot whatsoever. It's just another bunch of horndogs shacking up at a cabin in the woods and you know who is there. Surprised?. Of course not. The only historical thing about Part 3 is that it was originally in 3-D(not on video, sadly). Plus, it was also the introduction to Jason's hockey mask. The heroine, played horribly by Dana Kimmell, was a history with Jason. Apparently she was attacked by him a while back after she ran into the woods after having a fight with her parents. Whatever. Anyways, the film is violent and bloody as expected. There's even a murder scene that is very reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's demise in the original. The biker gang in this film are the only ones who do good jobs. Everyone else is pretty bad. Still, I like this movie. It's not the best Friday film, but it's up there. Richard Brooker, as Jason, is a good addition to the group of guys who've played him. The follow up, "The Final Chapter", was disappointing. Stupid, trashy fun. I don't know why I like it, I just do.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>If Paramount's A-movie franchise was Star Trek, then their B-movie franchise would definitely be Friday The 13th. A total of eight were made and, with the exception of '83, there was a Friday The 13th for every year in the Eighties, with the TV series debuting in '87.<br /><br />They were tacky, badly made and infrequently showed any professionalism, or dynamic filmmaking. But they sure had their moments and Part 3 is definitely the best of the first four, Part 5 being the joker in the pack and 6-8 the second instalment of the Jason Voorhees legacy.<br /><br />Apparently, not getting enough of butchering teenagers with the first sequel, director Steve Miner returns for more unlucky day murders. While his first outing was almost the exact same as the original, only with a different killer, Part 3 reinvents the franchise and totally solidifies Jason as a horror movie icon.<br /><br />Chris (Dana Kimmel) has had a difficult past few years and she decides to spend a long weekend at Higgins Haven with her friends. Too bad for them that Jason (Richard Brooker) is lurking in the woods. He and Chris have had a scuffle in the past and she's afraid to go out there alone.<br /><br />Her friends are an unusual bunch. There are a couple of stoners, Shelly, a fat kid who just wants to be loved (Larry Zerner), a pregnant friend (Tracie Savage) and her hunky squeeze (Paul Kratka). These are not the typical goofball sex-mad teenagers of the early Eighties. For some reason, the writers have made them somewhat subdued and realistic. They seriously want a quiet weekend - no partying, no loud music. It helps that we like them, because in most other occasions we can't wait for them to get slaughtered.<br /><br />And they aren't the only ones in trouble. A non-threatening biker gang plan to cause havoc at Higgins Haven, because Shelly knocked over their scooters, and end up regretting it. If anything, they make for some light comedy - intentional, or not.<br /><br />Halfway through, Shelly pulls a joke on the girl he fancies. He leaps out of the water wearing a hockey mask and brandishing a harpoon. Five minutes later Jason gets his hands on them. And ever since, the image of the hockey mask has been the trademark of the series.<br /><br />In every other sequel, Jason is a walking monolith. [...], show Michael Myers a thing or two about the art of teenage massacre and somehow be able to maintain his cool and make it all seems effortless. This is the only time you will see him for what he really is - a retarded hillbilly. He evens smiles! Twice!!<br /><br />Miner would return later to the same location in Lake Placid. Here, he successfully portrays Crystal Lake as a tranquil, peaceful place and manages, in the final scenes, to infuse it with atmospheric excitement, all without the use of rain, or lightning.<br /><br />It wouldn't be hard to make a sequel superior to the original Friday The 13th. Miner failed with Part 2, but excels in Part 3. It has a lighter tone and different feel from the others. In fact, it shouldn't be viewed as a horror film at all. It's an adventure movie, set in the woods, with one of the best villains ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 3-D BLU-RAY<br /><br />*** ? Out of 5<br /><br />For years the Friday the 13th movies were kicked aside by Paramount pictures with lame release after another. The original DVD releases had no features at all except for the theatrical trailer, which I personally don't consider to be a feature, but the 7th and 8th installments didn't even get that. Finally after the success of Freddy Vs Jason Paramount put out a set Crystal Lake to Manhattan, which featured the first 8 movies and while at least we finally got something it wasn't much to brag about and it was good overall, but the set was clearly rushed and really was about average at best as a whole.<br /><br />With the release of Friday the 13th 09, Paramount finally gave the fans what they have wanted for years and that was SE releases. February 09 saw the release of the original uncut for the first time in the States released on Blu-ray and DVD and part 2 and 3 also got Deluxe Edition DVD releases.<br /><br />Fans have wanted part 3 released in 3D and we finally got it. Despite being called a Deluxe Edition since it was anything but that, there were no features at all on the disc, but seeing as it was released in 3D it was easy to get over. There were problems with the DVD release with ghosting and double images and fan reaction was mixed. Now on June 16th, 2009 Friday the 13th Part 3 makes its debut on Blu-ray (along with Part 2) and unlike the DVD it has a nice batch of features, which is unfair to those who don't own Blu-ray players. I was 3-years old when this movie was first released so I have only been able to see the movie in 2D; I like this movie a lot and while it's not a very good movie per se it achieves what it sets out to do, but knowing it was originally in 3D it did kind of suck only being able to view it in 2D even if still enjoyable it was disappointing.<br /><br />So here we are with the Blu-ray release and the question is simple; is it worth the upgrade? Well that's what I'll cover as I review the disc.<br /><br />FRESH CUTS: 3D TERROR (HD)- 12:51<br />Solid feature that explains how the movie came to be plus the original idea before it became the movie we know; the 3D process is also covered and overall this was a solid feature that gives us enough info, but does leave you wanting slightly more, but overall it's a solid feature. Interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Larry Zerner, Richard Brooker, Sandi Love, Douglas White.<br /><br />LEGACY OF THE MASK (HD)- 9:32<br />Another strong feature, which explains how Jason got the mask and overall it was a fun feature and it also gets into the mask in the rest of the movies plus Jason's look through out the series; brief, but to the point; interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Richard Brooker, Douglas White, Larry Zerner.<br /><br />SLASHER FILMS: GOING FOR THE JUGULAR (HD)- 7:06<br />Another strong feature, which covers quickly what, makes these movies work so well and this might be my favorite feature on the disc even if we've seen numerous documentaries and books on this subject I still always find it entertaining. My only complaint is that it's too brief; Ari Lehman, Stu Charno, Tony Todd, Del Howison, Tony Moran, Harry Manfredini, Richard Brooker, Robbi Morgan and Larry Zerner appear.<br /><br />LOST TALES FROM CAMP BLOOD- PART 3 (HD)- 4:47<br />This is a short film written and directed by Andrew Ceperley and the first 2 parts can be found on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the first 2 movies; this one can only be seen on the Blu-ray for Part 3. Overall it was good running at under 5-minutes there is only so much that can be done, but I did enjoy this.<br /><br />THEATRICAL TRAILER (HD)- 2:09<br />No need to explain this.<br /><br />2D VERSION<br />Not every movie benefits from HD and this one is sort of one of those movies; the transfer while I suppose it an upgrade over the standard DVD, but I'm not really sure though. The transfer for the Blu-ray isn't really that good to be honest. After seeing the transfer for the original Friday the 13th I really got excited for this release, but there is no comparing the two at all. This one falls a bit flat in a lot of spots. The picture is a bit flat and there is noticeable grain in many scenes, and even in the standard version you can see spots of dirt on the screen, which I suppose is on the actual cameras and in HD you can see that even more; if one didn't know any better you might think it's on your TV set. Comparing the standard DVD to the Blu-ray the dirt is a bit more noticeable here and actually it can be a slight distraction at times; of all the Blu-ray's I own of flicks of a certain age this is by far the worst transfer; I heard the Deluxe Edition DVD also looked weak and in no way does this really improve. Like I said I don't think this really improves on the original DVD release. If I'm being totally honest here I think I might prefer the original standard release.<br /><br />That's not to say it's a total bust there are some moments where it looks good, but overall there is too much dirt and grain to really be worthy of being called an upgrade. Some scenes the grain is cleaned up compared to the original release, but there is still enough grain and blemishes on this transfer that in my opinion keep it from really being called an upgrade.<br /><br />Some scenes do stand out compared to the original DVD and look good, but never great. But there is just too much dirt and grain for this to be anything besides an ok transfer. The colors are sharp for the most part, but something just doesn't fully work here; at times the picture looks a little washed out. Again the Blu-ray in my opinion hardly looks better than the original standard DVD. In the area it might improve the look it also takes away due to the dirt. If this version is an upgrade I'd say its barley though.<br /><br />3D VERSION<br />The Deluxe Edition had a lot of problems with ghosting and double images and that is also a problem here as well. All the 3D scenes have a bit of ghosting or double images and there is a lot more grain to be found here unlike the 2D version, which again does suffer from that, but despite that the 3D does work well mostly. No doubt these problems are annoying and do slightly take away from the movie. Obviously this won't compare to the original theatrical release and I don't think it's anywhere near as good as the Blu-ray release of My Bloody Valentine, which worked surprisingly well; but again the 3D works well despite all the scenes having ghosting or double images. A couple of scenes do lose a little bit due to that, but while most are slightly annoying it doesn't take away from the movie and finally seeing Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3D adds a whole new layer to the movie and really adds to the entertainment. The stuff that works best are tree branches or leaves, dirt being blown by the wind and bugs flying around; Those are the things that play out the best, which is cool, but not really what we all want to look best.<br /><br />Nothing here for the most part works great; some 3D looks cool other times not so much. The strengths are the hobo in the beginning with the eyeball despite the ghosting and or double image it looks cool the bikers that are killed in the barn also works really well and I think some of those scenes were the strongest despite the problems mentioned. Some stuff however falls flat for instance like the sphere gun scene, which is something I bet most people really want to see; and when you do see it you'll be letdown as it doesn't work that well; when Rick's eyeball pops up out it works fairly decent. The biggest 3D gags are the ones that seem to fall short.<br /><br />The one scene that worked really great was after Jason gets hit in the head with an axe and he puts his arms out in front of him. Sure we have the same problems of ghosting or double images, but even that cannot take away from the scene as it actually plays out really cool problems and all. That scene really got me going since it was so cool again despite the problems. The handle of the Axe also works well for the most part and I'd say these scenes are probably the best along with the barn scenes.<br /><br />So like I said the 3D doesn't work great and some really fall flat, but most work; remember though it never works great, but good enough for the viewer to not only have fun, but probably watch the 3D version all the time instead of the 2D. The 3D version does add a new layer to the movie and quite honestly makes the movie a little more fun and makes it feel a little new as well since most of us are seeing it in 3D for the first time.<br /><br />Some reviews I've seen make the Blu-ray sound like perfection and some have compared it to the theatrical version. I never say this about other people's reviews, but I honestly think those reviews are by people paid by the studio or they are just seeing what they wanna see; despite what some say there is indeed ghosting and double images just like the DVD version, but regardless of those problems again annoying, yes, but still a lot of fun. As stated earlier there is a bit more grain on the 3D version, but even with the grain, ghosting and double images it cannot ruin the fun of seeing this movie in 3D. Don't go into this expecting perfection; just keep in mind the flaws I explained and you should be fine. Not every 3D scenes works and the ones that do don't work great and the ghosting and double images are annoying, but shouldn't ruin the experience of the film.<br /><br />AUDIO<br />We have two options the first; Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Dolby Digital Mono. The sound is good, but nothing special. It never really enhances the movie at all. I hoped it would pick up sounds in the background, but it never really does that. The TrueHD 5.1 is solid in terms of the music; the score plays out great and loud and the shrieks in the music might make you jump once or twice where as the dialogue sounds good, but I felt it was a little low. You can hear everything the characters say, but I found it a little lifeless. I actually watched the movie with the original Mono track, which I felt as a whole sounded better, the score might have a little bit more of a jolt to it with the TrueHD, but overall I found the mono track to be the better of the two.<br /><br />FINAL WORDS ON THE DISC<br />I had two TVs I tried this on; one set the 3D looked ok it pops out, but nothing really stands out. I than tried it on a plasma TV and it worked far better there. So I think it will all depend on the TV you have. Some sets the 3D may not work that well where as other TV sets it will look a lot better. The extra features while brief are enjoyable and this may not be the ultimate release, but it is a solid one. The flaws with the picture can be forgiven, but the 2D version does fall a bit flat and the ghosting and double images on the 3D can be slightly annoying, but the sheer fun of seeing it in 3D will help you get over it. Bottom line is Friday the 13th Part 3 on Blu-ray doesn't make for the perfect Hi-Def experience, but it gets the job done. If you have the Deluxe Edition the only reason to buy this is for the extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>First, let me preface this review by saying that if you don't like slasher/horror flicks to begin with, then you sure as hell aren't going to like "Friday the 13th part 3", but if you are a fan of the genre then you are in for a treat with this one.  Still, with that being said, some horror movie fans and critics alike would disagree with my assertion that "Friday the 13th part 2" and/or "Friday the 13th part 3" are the best of the "Friday the 13th" series and those people would clearly be wrong.  The acting and scripts for parts 2 & 3 are without a doubt superior to the other movies.  Steve Miner did an outstanding job with both Friday the 13th part 2 and 3, which are also the most dynamic movies of the series, and while one could legitimately argue that part 2 is technically superior than part 3 in the sense of being scary (it's a tough call, but Jason with the hood and his style in part 2 was scarier in my opinion), I think that part 3 has a little extra something that makes it a little more interesting than part 2.  I should say that I think the score is even better for "Friday the 13th part 3" with the advent of that funky-scary music that we get in the opening credits of this brilliant horror flick.<br /><br />At any rate, part 3 starts out recapping what happened at the end of "Friday the 13th part 2".  Immediately following the part 2 murders, the audience is introduced to a very attractive young lady named Chris who has had a traumatic and mysterious confrontation with Jason Voorhees.  Chris is trying to overcome her fear of this past experience by going back to the "scene of the incident" if you will.  Hence, you have the plot of this movie in a somewhat different setting than the other Friday 13th flicks.  I like this underlying theme of the mysterious attack by Jason Voorhees against Chris...I think it really sets the tone and provides an interesting and refreshing perspective for this series.<br /><br />Chris and her friends return to the cabin location and Chris tries to deal with her fears and her memory of the horrible attack.  I thought the addition of the barn was a terrific arena for horror with this type of movie...you have it all in this one: the woods, the barn and the cabins...great setting for what is a great slasher flick.  Meanwhile, while Chris and friends are arriving at the cabin, Jason has just finished a massive killing spree and is hungry for more blood, and of course, Chris in her crew are most definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />In "Friday the 13th part 3", we have more dynamic characters and better character development in general; this is where part 3 is slightly better than part 2, although I did like Paul and Ginny as well.  For instance, in part 3, Shelley provides an interesting character as he is a weird kind of fellow with an inferiority complex.  He constantly engages in morbid-like pranks with gore in which he tricks everyone into thinking he has been brutally murdered.  This sets the tone for later of course when Jason actually kills Shelley and it is a really great scene when Shelley is finally discovered dead for real.  Also, I really loved the advent of the biker crew...I thought the little altercation between Shelley and the bikers was an interesting and fun subplot.  The actors who played Ali, Fox and Loco were outstanding.  In fact, Ali is a dangerous man in his own right and provides Jason with some combative competition...okay, not much competition but he's better than the girls he ends up losing to in the end.  I must admit that my favorite part of the movie is when Fox is swinging on that rope on the second floor of that barn and Loco reprimands her while she is having such a good time and then when he looks back, Fox aint there no more...I guess she found Jason somewhat more formidable than that little girl she bullied in the grocery mart.<br /><br />Anyway, Jason disposes of his prey in the usual fashion with some creativity.  In fact, I really love the murder scene when that guy is always walking with his hands and eventually runs into Jason. OUCH!!!  But, by and large, the acting and script for this movie is just superior to the others...I give "Friday the 13th part 3" a slight but distinct edge over "Friday the 13th part 2" from that perspective.  Steve Miner did a brilliant job with both movies and both are slasher classics and must own DVDs for horror movie fans.<br /><br />As an interesting point of trivia, Jason donnes the notorious hockey mask in "Friday the 13th part 3"...it belonged to Shelley and was rudely stolen from him after his gruesome demise.<br /><br />"Friday the 13th part 3" is one of the very best slasher flicks ever and is an absolute must own for all serious and sophisticated horror movie fans.  Anyone who thinks this is bad slasher flick obviously has no idea what he/she is talking about.  Enjoy Jason's finest and buy "Friday the 13th part 3"...you'll be glad you did as you can watch this one over and over again...a solid 4 STAR slasher-horror flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AFOK05KDCHSHL.html">AFOK05KDCHSHL</a><br/><p>FRIDAY THE 13th PART III<br /><br />(USA - 1982)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (3-Depix)<br />Theatrical soundtrack: Mono<br /><br />Though not without entertainment value, the third entry in this long-running series (initiated by FRIDAY THE 13th in 1980) is no more than disposable fluff, reliant on its 3-D gimmick to draw a mass audience. It serves no other purpose. Whereas the first two movies established the basic premise (the villain in part 2 takes up where his/her predecessor left off in part 1), "Part III" doesn't advance the scenario at all, merely restages the same plot as before: Teens take a weekend trip into the woods and are targeted for destruction by the seemingly unstoppable Jason.<br /><br />The plot is negligible, the characters conform to stereotype, and the constant stream of violent murders seems even more senseless than before. In fact, the indiscriminate nature of Jason's victims allows consistency to fall by the wayside, thereby signalling the film's status as little more than a mindless thrill-machine, the victim of lazy scriptwork by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson. To be fair, however, it's doubtful that a radical change in the basic scenario would have been acceptable to contemporary audiences. In 1982, these simple thrills were more than enough to ring the box-office bell, and woe betide any producer who dared to mess with a winning formula!<br /><br />The best efforts of sophomore director Steve Miner (also responsible for FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2, 1981) are compromised by two important factors: First, the cast seems to have been chosen on the basis of looks rather than acting ability, and the only character with a halfway decent plot-thread (the overweight guy whose feeble pranks are a desperate attempt to ingratiate himself with his peers) meets a predictably 'ironic' end long before his genuine emotional distress can be allowed to detract from the orchestrated mayhem. And secondly, the requirements of 3-D photography - in particular, the attention paid to the point of convergence from shot to shot, in order to prevent eyestrain and headaches in the audience - has resulted in visual and dramatic compromises, slowing the movie's rhythm and sapping all vitality from the narrative (this was true of many other 3-D movies which opened the following year). Seen in 3-D, the extra dimension is a genuinely effective novelty which enhances the viewing experience tenfold, from the opening credits (which seem to shoot out of the screen with startling clarity) through to the extended finale when Jason's rampage literally spills into the audience's lap. Viewed flat, for all its bloody violence and exaggerated body count, the film is a lumbering, pointless rehash of the first two entries, with no identity of its own.<br /><br />Followed by FRIDAY THE 13th: THE FINAL CHAPTER (1984).</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>Yet another camp, yet another bunch of teens, and allot more gore than before. This sequel proves to be quite an improvement from before. Still nothing special, but it's probably worth a look at.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>While FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 2 left some to be desired, the ending to that movie was satisfying and ultimately led us into this third and impressive entry into the popular horror series. While the intro credits score was a little cheesy, the movie itself is anything but that. Thanks to a better cast, a biker gang, and a little more believable hormone-driven agenda, this entry is worthwhile for all fans of the series. While no longer presented in 3-D on DVD (the 3-d was cool), you can still feel hints of that technology in some of the movies scenes featuring Jason's weapons of choice.<br /><br />Once again, Camp Crystal Lake is open for business and another population of sex-inspired teens are on duty for more. Not only that, but we also have a biker gang that adds more to the movie than just the counselors...now anyone can go if Jason don't like you...and he doesn't. He wastes no time in dispatching away one counselor or biker after the other (the biker that got the pitchfork got the worst of it, ouch!). This is also the first movie where Jason finally dons the hockey mask, which is now a most sought after costume accessory where I'm from. There are many good scenes in the movie, especially where poor Jason is hanging and then finally gets free...there's just no way to stop him, he seems to be invincible. The ending, of course, leaves the movie open for what would be one of the most superior of the series, THE FINAL CHAPTER.<br /><br />But while you sift through the series, don't skip over this little goody. This a landmark in the series as it shows the first scenes of Jason in his official mask. FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 3 is a must-see for anyone who wants to see where Jason "officially" came to life. You've been warned...</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>It was all the rage in 1982, 3-D.  Jaws did it.  Amityville did it.  Now Jason has really done it!  Most people think all F13 films are all the same.  Nothing can be further from the truth. I thought that the 2nd was pretty lame, but this one was fun.  Jason gets his props here.  He picks up his now famous hockey mask, and his legend really begins here.  Things fly out you because of the 3-D, some gimmicky, but it doesn't take away from the suspense, gore, and the fun for this third go around.  Enjoy camping out.  Turn out the lights...chhh  hhhaaa</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Some have called "Part 3" one of the best of the "Friday The 13th"s, but personally it was not a favorite.  I would place it above only "Jason X".  That's not to say I disliked it; I enjoyed it quite a lot, but it doesn't come close to some of the other "Friday's that make my 'best-of' list.  It's probably the least distinguished and least distinct of its series, but it succeeds in spite of itself.  There are some interesting ideas (that could have been fleshed out more), but also some seeming contradictions in the time scale.  There are some likable characters (though not to the level of "Part 2"'s overall cast) and some less likable ones.  The girls are very pretty.<br /><br />  In the last 20 minutes or so, the quality of the film picks up sharply.  Prevoiusly a good watch, it suddenly starts to attain the superior feel and spirit of its two predecessors, almost but not quite making it to their level, albeit a little late.<br /><br />  Obviously much of the appeal of the original theatrical release was its 3-D nature, but unfortunately it is not available over here in that format, despite the capacity of DVD to support it, nor does it look like it'll get a domestic release in 3D anytime soon.  In that case I wish they'd re-release it theatrically, because even though its not one of the best Fridays, I'd still love a chance to give the 3D version a chance.  As it is, the non-3D disc available still manages to be a worthy part of the saga, though not a high point.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>wake me up when this bore of a movie has end.  This film is past ridiculous.  The movie is about stupid teens who get slaughtered.  Why would anyone be impressed by that?  Plus there is no point to making this movie. Furthermore, There is hardly a storyline and the acting is horrible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>The third installment is the one "Friday" fans remember the most, because this is where Jason gets his trademark hockey mask. a group of teenagers decide to spend the weekend at one of there parents' summer cabin, that is right adjacent to... yup, you guessed it, Crystal Lake Campgrounds. This is the first "Friday" film that I saw (in 1984...on VHS...as a new release...I feel soooo old, right now) & its still one of my favorites. <p>Dana Kimmell, who plays Chris, is married w/ kids & has a strong Mormon background. She hasn't done any sort of acting since 1990 but, she might return to acting in the future. Paul Kratka, who plays Rick, practices Chiropratics in California (source - www.fridaythe13thfilms.com).<p>As for the DVD, there isn't much hope. 2.0 Dolby Digital with no special features ("Paramount Home Video" knows its going make money off the strong fan base to these films, so, the studio threw the films out to the public for a quick buck. Thanks for almost nothing).</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Jason Voorhees has become the most beloved of Hollywood's strong, silent type. Part 3 is a step above Parts 1 &amp; 2. Although the first two films definately had their moments, Part 3 is where the famous 'Jasonesque' takes root and conquers America. Not only is Jason finally the way we want him to be, Part 3 also included a complex script with side stories and deeper character development. If you really analyze this film, you will see that not only does it have all the makings of an Acadamy Award, it is a brilliant tribute to directing. Let me explain.......<p>This film is most infamous because Jason finally gets his hockey mask. He takes it off his victim (he also takes the speargun). The victim in question is a fat, pathetic white kid with a big afro. He is always pulling practical jokes, not to scare or hurt, but for attention. His friend asks him why he continues with his hijinks. Poeticly, he answers &quot;I'd rather be a loser than nothing at all'. How many here reading this right now have not told themselves the same thing? Everyone, all together, group hug.<p>Even though this movie is early 80's it is far ahead of its time in social views. For the first time in a movie, a Latino / Hispanic American is represented in the form of a teenage girl. The story gives subtle yet obvious clues into her life. She has an argument with her 'mama' before heading out to the farm. Her mother doesn't want her hanging around her 'white hoodlum devil' friends. &quot;We don't take food stamps here!&quot; is a phrase I'm sure she's heard many times, but our fat loser saves the day with cash, but the wallet causes a whole other problem......<p>The beautiful thing about this movie is that it breaks the social and racial barriers. A biker gang (consisting of course of three people) is post-racial. We have a white guy, a black guy, and a Spanish woman. See how the three of them get along as equals. Harmony for all, that is the real message of Friday the 13th Part 3.<p>And lastly we have a tribute to our noble past, the 1960's. Two middle aged burnouts who have nothing to do with the story and who have nothing to contribute to the plot, simply become fodder for the machette. This is the director telling us that the glory days of drug abuse is over. Clean bodies and minds will lead us through the 80's, 90's and into the millenium. Drug users have no place in society's future and thank God it worked out that way.<p>With plenty of action (tubby running over motorcycles with a VW Beetle to defend the honor of his hot tamale love interest) and suspense (will Jason survive a hanging and axe to the head?) to drama (who could have guessed the biker was alive in the barn the whole time? Swing that chain!) and finally the conclusion of this exciting and marvellous film. Part 4 only continued in the fine tradition of high quality film making.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>&quot;Friday the 13th Part 3&quot; is my favorite of the entire series. Of course there is the obligatory killing and naked women running around, but I think the best part of this film is the 3-D effects that were used back in the early 80's when 3-D movies were popular. Even though the film technically isn't in 3-D anymore, the gags used to make the 3-D effect are hilarious. The humor alone makes this film worth seeing. I would highly recommend watching this film if you want a scare and a good laugh!</p></br><a href="../users/A7PBI5HADJYER.html">A7PBI5HADJYER</a><br/><p>Jason gets his hockey mask (and kills a bunch of teens in the woods)!  Plot-wise, that's the only thing differentiating it from the previous entries.  There's also the fact that the movie was filmed in 3-D, which explains why there's a lot of dangerous objects waved maniacally in front of the screen.  Not much in the way of suspense, and while Dana Kimmell and Catherine Parks are hot, neither get naked.  The last twenty minutes, a big stalk and chase sequence, is pretty good, however, and the movie's only real saving grace.  Better than part 2, but hardly the most enjoyable film of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>First off..I want to make it clear. I'm am NOT basing my review on the film itself. Personally, I love this movie, its one of my top two favorites in the whole Friday the 13th series,, so there's no way I would rate this movie this low. This review is simply based on the 3-D aspect of the film, which I must say..is pretty disappointing. First off, the generic Red & Blue 3-D glasses always give me headaches when I watch 3-D movies with them, but if the effects are good, its usually well worth it. Unfortunately, I was pretty much just left with the headache after viewing this one. The only thing that kept it interesting was the fact that the movie is great, and I just stayed focused on watching it, and for the most part, had to ignore the 3-D! In a nutshell..they're just wasn't much "3-D" in this 3-D movie. Most of the gimmicks just didn't work..I kept just seeing double a lot on the screen, rather than images actually standing out. They were a couple of kinda cool moments here and there (Harold putting the stick back on the clothesline, the yo yo gimmick was alright, and the pitchfork through the throat of Fox), but other than that, the 3-D was just more of an annoyance rather than a bonus. Also, I was really disappointed that there were no other special features on the DVD. I recently repurchased the Deluxe Editions of Parts 1 and 2 simply because of the special features (and a pretty cool sliding case!), but I was surprised that there wasn't any added features to this one, except the 3-D feature. This just clearly shows another attempt at the movie companies to sucker fans into buying the film yet again. And I guess its working, cause I bought it! The non 3-D version of the film is also included, so you don't need to glasses to watch the movie, and if you don't own this movie, then this is a decent buy..at least you'll have the "deluxe" 3-D version, but unless you're a die hard horror fan like myself, there no real reason to buy this if you already have it. Believe me, the 3-D just isn't worth it! I'm giving this 2 stars simply because of my love for this film, the fact that the non 3-D version of the film is on the disc, and the sliding case is kinda cool! But shame on Paramount for not adding anything else new to the film, and yet calling it a "Deluxe Edition"..one special feature (and a poorly executed one, at that) doesn't make it deluxe by any means.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>IN THIS ONE, JASON REGAINS CONCIOUSNESS AND CONTINUES HIS VIOLENT SPREE AT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE ON ALL LEVELS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES. THIS MOVIE WAS ORIGINALLY IN 3-D, BUT IN THE VIDEO AND DVD, JASON'T JUST HIS REGULAR TWO DIMENSIONAL SELF. GOOD MOVIE AND IT'S VERY THRILLING. WHAT ALSO MAKES THIS SO SPECIAL IS THAT JASON IS FINALLY SEEN IN HIS FAMOUS HOCKEY MASK. I'D RECCOMEND THIS TO ANY HORROR FAN.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>This part was the most underrated in first three. and better than first two. In this part Jason found his famous mask and became Jason that most of us know! First part honestly was ridiculous. second part was better but not scary at all, but this part had some real horror scenes. It was a better try than first two but still not as good as first class horror movies. Most of murder scenes were good specially when Jason split up that boy into two parts I reallt got excited! but Killing Rick by pressing his skull although was good at concept but was fair in production. Jumping out one of his eyes from a soft plastic face was more like some of that games in play houses! Nowadays they make every thing they imagine with CG, natural and beleavable! but in old movies I think they should have not created scenes that they couldn't made them perfect!<br /><br />Anyway, in my opinion this was the part that real Firday the 13th series has begun!</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>he hacks up bikers.thats the storyline.its the last of the original 3.in the big scheme of things this is low on the friday the 13th food chain.i gave all of them but 1 ,3 stars,so its still good!with a bunch of bikers hanging around,youre assured something vile will happen even before jason pop in.even the hells angels or whatever biker gang they are cant stop jason!hell itself couldnt keep him down either! there are now 11 parts.he gets to hell in part 9.;</p></br><a href="../users/A2LAA9SCENXLKN.html">A2LAA9SCENXLKN</a><br/><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above is possibly skewed by the ratings on this specific site. There might be a slightly different rating at the end.<br /><br />The first hour is completely lame. No gore, and virtually no kills. Very little Jason. It's all Elementary School level drama. The bully to get attention situation. WE SAW THIS WHEN WE WERE 8, WE WANT SOME STEAK NOT BABY MILK!!!! Fortunately, the last 35 minutes include some awesome as he11 kills. In one scene *SPOILER ALERT* We see Jason slice his machete through a dude's upside-down body!!! *SPOILER ALERT OVER.* This also has the cheesiest soundtrack ever, a huge downturn from the original. The movie is also very random. Roadkill and hippies coming out of nowhere. Scenes are just placed wherever. Oh, and did I forget to mention it's in 3-D?<br /><br />The 3-D WOULD be better than Digital 3D if it weren't for the fact that it's cardboard glasses that are square. So, my prescription glasses made the movie way less entertaining. It was so distracting. Now, you're probably screaming at the screen "CHANGE IT TO 2D! DOESN'T THE DVD HAVE THAT OPTION?" Well yeah, it does. But I wanted to experience it the way the creators meant it to. BTW, at 23:25, you can see Jason's silhouette hidden on the van door. Also, Jason is weak in this film! YOU DON'T DO THAT! You can make him human (sort of) to damage. But don't make him weak! Not Jared from Subway nor God, he is Andre the Giant of Slasher Films!<br /><br />And the rules. This is the film where #1 evolved into taking a shower. It's debatable about a new Rule #7: Don't get in a car. But it definably was created through the rest of the series, especially in Part VI: Jason Lives. The ending, I don't think it really can be spoiled. But don't read the next sentence if you think. It's a blatant rip-off of the original with Jason's mom. But here's the thing: MRS. VOORHEES DID NOT @#$%ING DROWN!!! And with the original already got me by the B@11$, it definably doesn't have the same effect. And here's a question: what about Jason's father? With the cheap cheap cheap cheap shot shot shot shots that this has taken to the series, could we please see that? Are we gonna see it in another part? Tune in next time!<br /><br />The Rating? Well...the first hour gets a 1/5. The last 1/3rd gets a 3.6/5. This averages to 2.05/5. And that last .05 gets taken out with the annoying 3-D glasses (for my personal experience.) But since other people view the movie, it all averages out to an extremely complex 2.025/5!!!!<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman signing off.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Chris and her friends just want to have a good time this weekend, so they're taking a trip to her family's nice, relaxing family cabin in Higgins Haven. Unfortunately for them, Jason survived his encounter with Ginny from the last film. He winds up at a store where he kills a married couple and gets a change of clothes. Higgins Haven just happens to be close by. Chris has more than one reason for going on this trip though. She was attacked a few years ago by a hideously disfigured man and is facing her fears in hopes of moving past it. Could this mysterious man and Jason have something in common?<br /><br />This is the film that introduced us to the hockey mask and was originally in 3-D. It's a shame that's all it really offers though. Watching the 3-D version now will just leave you with a horrible headache. I actually prefer the film in 2-D. The nudity in the film is also rather light and before you jump on me for saying that, that's one of the main things you look forward to in a Friday the 13th film; Jason Voorhees, inventive kills, T&A, and maybe a few laughs. That's what makes the Friday the 13th films fun. Especially compared to the first two films, sideboob and a brief glimpse in the shower doesn't really cut it. I guess what really ruined it for me was the homages to the first film. By the way, what was up with the ending? And why does Mrs. Voorhees suddenly have her head again? It wasn't a bad idea to do a few throwbacks to the original, but it felt like too much by the end of the film.<br /><br />Rating - 5/10</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite Friday the 13th films! One of the reasons is because he finally gets his infamous hockey mask! This has the plot of some young adults going to an abandoned house for the weekend, and Jason happens to show up. This one does it well, but Part 4,5, and 7 pretty much do the same thing. Chris, Debbie, Andy, Shelly, Vera, Chuck and Chili stay at a farm house in the woods, hoping to have a good time, but Jason comes and crashes the party. I highly recommend FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 3-D!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This movie has always ranked high as one of my personal favorites in the series. The 3D scenes may look cheesy without 3D, but the story is just as cool as the original. There are many memorable parts of the movie that I have always loved for many years, especially all of the scenes that were about the biker gang. The character Shelly has always been one of my favorite characters in the series because I can sadly relate to the guy a little too much. This is also the movie of which Jason finally gets his mask! So, with everything, this is a really cool movie and a historical one if for no other reason than this is Jason's hockey mask debut!</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>The Friday the 13th series is one that will go down in history as one of the most celebrated, yet bad series of all time.  This entry still shows that there's life in the series, although it doesn't do that good of a job showing you the possibility.<br /><br />This, as with the first two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001MXXM">Friday the 13th</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001MXXP">Friday the 13th, Part 2</a>, begins where the pervious one ended.  This edition brings Jason back for his second go around and it's more of the same.<br /><br />Another recommended, but mostly for a watch release.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Jason (Richard Brooker) continues to roll up the body count in this somewhat lame and very predictable sequel.  Jason has managed to survive having a machette thrust into his neck at the end of part 2, and now he has come upon a small general store and its two unsuspecting occupants.  Soon, they are added to Jason's body count.<br /><br />Meanwhile, another group of "innocent" and horny teenagers are on their way to the lake.  Chris (Dana Kimmel) has survived an earlier encounter with Jason.  She ran away from her house and ended up alone in the woods.  That was when Jason tried to attack her.  However, she blacked out and somehow ended up back in her own room.  She's come back to finally get rid of her fears.  Several of her friends have decided to come along.<br /><br />Their first mistake occurs when Chris and Shelley go into town to buy groceries.  They run into a rough motorcycle gang.  Unfortunately for Shelley, he backs into one of the motorcycles, which in turn knocks over the rest.  Enraged, the gang takes off after Chris and Shelley.  They follow Chris and Shelley back to camp where they decide to burn down the barn, but Jason get ahold of them before they can carry out their plan.<br /><br />After that, the teenagers start dropping off one by one until Chris is left to face Jason alone.  Will Chris survive, or will Jason add her to his ever-growing list of victims?<br /><br />I thought this movie was worse than the first tow.  This was billed to be even more scary, because it was filmed in 3-D.  The 3-D effects may have looked good in the theater, but they are non-existant on the DVD.  The plot of this series has become very predictable, and there is nothing really different from the first two movies of the series.  Jason does find his trademark hockey mask in this movie, however.<br /><br />I recommend this movie only if you are serious about watching every following one.  One aspect I do like is that there is a short recap of part 2 at the beginning of this movie.  This helps the viewer in case one forgot what happened previously.  Hopefully, the movies following this one will get a little better and everything won't be so predictable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Steve Miner<br /><br />Cast:  Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka, Richard Brooker, Nick Savage, Rachel Howard, David Katims, Larry Zerner, Tracie Savage, Jeffrey Rogers.<br /><br />Running Time:  93 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme gore and violence, language, and sexual situations.<br /><br />Jason has survived the massacre from "Friday the 13th, Part 2" and continues on his way, butchering two more people in a truck stop diner. This doesn't stop a new group of friends from going to the lake for a good ol' weekend of sex and relation. While their, two of them, Shelly (Larry Zerner) and Chris (Dana Kimmell) leave the lake to go buy supplies, and run afoul of a local biker gang. Shelly nearly destroys the leader's (Nick Savage) bike, and they vow payback on the kids. While sabotaging their van, two of them get killed by Jason, who the kids don't know is there. With Chris and boyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka) enjoying a talk in the woods, they begin to suspect foul play when their car dies out. Shelly ends up scaring a girl he likes, Vera (Catherine Parks) who sends him away. He goes into the barn, where he thinks Chuck (David Katims) and Chili (Rachel Howard) are, but runs into Jason. Jason goes back and kills Vera, then goes into the cabin were the kids are 'sleeping' and kills two more, leaving only Chuck, Chili, Chris and Rick; no one aware of Jason's presence. Jason now launches an all-out assault on the camp, leaving only Chris and Rick, leading to a solo fight against the killer.<br /><br />Director Steve Miner returns to the helm for his second sequel in a row, both does not pull through as he did with "Part 2"; his inability to build up any good scares or shocks as well as the fact that he takes too long to get the movie going. His direction hasn't improved much at all and he's certainly not helping himself by not trying anything new or different in this film. There are a few memorable death scenes, particularly one guy who gets slashed in half when he's walking around on his hands, but these moments aren't built up to particularly well, there's no sense of dread and almost no suspense; what little of it is there is mainly because of Harry Manfredini's very effective and creepy Ennio Morricone-esque score.  The gore effects are in more abundance than in the previous two films, but they still look rather cheesy sometimes.  The film is actually saved by a very riveting, exciting finale, in which all the cliches are used, such as the car that (in)conveniently runs out of gas, the dead body in the closet, the killer who's really not dead, etc., but Steve Miner actually handles the entire sequence quite well.  Overall, a sequel with much to be desired; however, at least it created a Halloween icon with its first usage of the famed hockey mask.  The first two films were much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Gather around, young children, for I have a tale to impart. It is of a young boy with a severe Oedipal complex who lived on Crystal Lake. The days of peaceful skinny-dipping and sweet young love are gone. Jason's mom has died at the hands of some buxom girl, and Jason is out for teenage blood. Please don't look behind the hockey mask, for it is horrifying. He is scarred, nearly mutated. He seems to possess super-powers because he is incapable of dying. Accept your destiny because he will always come back. Forget about slicing and dicing this once-kind lad. He is indestructible. Run for your life. No, don't go into the woods and down the road. That would make too much sense. Lock yourself in the house. Stand still. Breathe and wait to die.<br /><br />There you have it my dear on-lookers. This is the story of Friday the 13th Part 3, the same story as in just about all the sequels to Friday the 13th, except this time Jason goes to New York City. Since I was six years old when this film came out, my parents had little interest in taking me to this film. This is unfortunate because I will never get the chance to relish what might have been pretty nifty 3D effects<br /><br />The film was shot in 3D and looks pretty bland on video or DVD. A kid is about to swing a bat and it is strangely positioned near the filmmaker's camera lens. Ditto for a variety of other objects like a rope, a yo-yo, and a spear entering the eye of a Hispanic girl who only carries food stamps in her wallet. Without the ability to experience the 3D aspect, all that remains are gratuitous shot compositions.<br /><br />Watching this film is an unbearable experience because it rehashes the original's formula. There is no spontaneity, just by-the-numbers killings surrounded by crude filler material. The audience is aware that the purpose of the film is to see Jason kill a couple of a teenagers, with one teenager (two, if you're lucky) surviving at the film's end. There is no need to hear couples talk about sex and relationships because the material serves no lasting purpose. Our emotional attachment is to Jason's slings and arrows.<br /><br />Director Steve Miner gets credit for the camp element, though. It's delightful hearing characters say such things as "you put this barrier between us and I want to break through" or "nothing is going to happen if we're all here together." He seems to have fun with the idea of the teenager in peril and he flies with it. But all of this is ultimately irrelevant because the film is not particularly scary. An opening flashback reminds us of the events that transpired in the first two films causing us to expect more of the same. Teenagers will dress like Pat Benatar and smoke as much pot as they want and when they take off their clothes, heads will fly.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>After the ending of Part 2 left the handsomely rugged (well, one out of two isn't bad) Vorhees with a machete in the back of his neck, it seemed that the worst was over. Camp Crystal Lake, an area stretching just over four square miles, had been the sight of eight grotesque murders, with the media speculating over rumors of mutilations and cannibalism that had followed in suite. Still, and ending had been achieved. As is the case with many a primal killing machine, however, one blow is often not enough to do the deed - especially if that blow is to the lower neck on the back of the aggressor - and Jason was left with the ability to breath, thereby allowing him to heal and start again. Enter a van loaded with seven occupants on their way to a secluded home just outside of Crystal Lake, lead by a former introductee to Mr. Vorhees scarred by the run-in and who wants to confront and vanquish those demons. Well, her friends are there for her like good friends should be, and they opt to journey into the seclued home where the deed took place to have fun/ be there for her. On the way there they are confronted by an elderly gentlemen that tells them, amidst his insane rambling, that they are all in peril and to flee, but this is a time for fun and sun so they ignore this herald and continue on with their troubled colleague. Yes, her friends are there for her, until the would-be fun turns into a nightmare and then the dying times begin.<p>While showing some signs of aging in the world of more modern effectual bliss, the movie still has some strong points in the ways of slasher flicks and is the portion of the Friday the 13th legacy that introduced a icon into the fold. That's because it was here, amidst the suffering introduced to many a victim, that the persona of Jason was adopted and his mask was found. Still, that's only one of the points I liked about the movie. Personally, I enjoy the drawn out stalking that takes place as Jason plays cat-and-mouse in those early days, letting the audience familiarize themselves with his potential victims before the killing begins. This lets personalities develop amongst the troops, showcasing two chronically abusive merrymen as they seek out high after high, a local countryboy, the damaged damsel, the two lovers that are expecting, the jerk/prankster, and the somewhat stuck-up blind date as they wander toward that machete-toting brick wall. Combine this with the fact that there are plenty of other disposable portions of suffering to pad the scenes, letting the mind do a little shopping and follow a few bikers into the realms of attitude correction, and you have yourself a funderland of experiences.<p>If you've seen other Friday the 13ths and you are looking for some of the more serious slasher times, then this is one of introduction points. The effects aren't the best here and the storyline does have its holes, but the characters tend to find ways to overcome that and the ending chase and the damage that ensues in the end more than make up for it. Its like a fun-loving romp, with scissors!</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>"Friday the 13th - Part 3" is one of my favorite parts of the series. Whether or not you see this in 3-D, this is a great slasher film. From the pranks and antics of Shelly to the rather goofy but entertaining hippie couple, the way cool but troublesome biker gang to Vera's death (that one was a doozy!), this movie delivers the goods. Also, this is the first "Friday the 13th" where Jason puts on the iconic hockey mask! Bloody chills and late-night thrills are flying like daggers your way on...Friday the 13th! So don't miss out on a classic slasher film, check this out as soon as you can! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>It is not easy to say which one of the F-13 movies is the best. Each of the first four adds a little more to the grim story of Jason Voorhees until they come to their bloody (if temporary) finale in "The Final Chapter." I think everyone would agree, however, that despite the gimmick of 3-D, which was enjoying one of its brief revivals of interest back in '82, and despite the ususal undertone of silliness that marks all of these films, that Part III is a damned good slasher movie, and one which will go down in horror-movie history as the "one where Jason got his mask."<br /><br />Part III picks up almost immediately where Part II left off, with a wounded Jason Voorhees resuming his killing spree at a roadside convenience store run by a sadly likeable man and his shrilling hag wife. After this further reduction of the population of Crystal Lake, we are introduced to this movie's batch of victims: a husband-wife pair of stoners, a horny teen couple, an annoying prankster, a snobby-hot girl, a dudely-doorite with a torch for the troubled heroine, and the heroine herself. Via an incident at yet another roadside store, we also meet three Central Casting bikers who are dumb enough to think they will be the film's antagonists, but who merely present additional fodder for Jason's knife. All these unfortunates convene at Higgins' Hideaway, the ususal rustic house set beside the usual rustic barn. There's just one problem. Jason's in the barn!<br /><br />There obviously is no need to go into the plot. All F-13 films are essentially plot-free, the "story" merely being how each individual sucker will die at Jason's hands, and how the heroine (for it is almost always a girl, though sometimes she has male help) will ultimately put the pause button on Jason's crusade to curb teenage sex and marijuana abuse in Crystal Lake. In that regard the film delivers fairly well, beginning with more or less ordinary kills and ramping up to some truly savage acts of violence, not the least of which is one poor slob who gets a machete right through the crown jewels, and another whose head gets crushed like a rotten tomato in a vice.<br /><br />Now, I am only giving credit where it is due to say that some of these poor people are actually fairly well-drawn, and that the actors all do credible [or better] jobs of conveying their characters' limited personalities. I truly didn't want some of these folks to die, which of course adds to the suspense. What's more, the scene in which Jason finally appears with his newfound hockey mask is not only a piece of horror-movie history, it's also a damned effective piece of visual terrorism. And the movie's climax is just relentless, with the violently active Jason tearing the barn to pieces trying to get at our long-suffering heroine. There are a lot of real jumpy moments in this flick, a couple of nice in-jokes ("Fangoria" magazine, for example) and the shrieking musical score by Harry Manfredini only adds to the viewer's jangled nerves.<br /><br />To be sure the film has its problems. All slasher films, and FRIDAY films in particular, depend upon the extreme stupidity of the characters and their complete failure to exercise common sense or even rudimentary brain-function ("Go down to the cellar and check the fuse box.") Also on the audience's willingness to swallow a lot of preposterous occurances, some of which are just plain physically impossible. Part III is no exception. Nearly everyone in the movie is clueless, and their collective failure to notice the hulking murderer with the deformed head constantly walking in and out of a barn 30 feet from their house is cause for dismay. The fact that the Jason had a machete plunged halfway through his torso at the climax of Part II is not in much in evidence here either; since he doesn't become truly supernatural until Part VI, it's hard to explain how that wouldn't effect his performance, or how he survives some of the abuse he takes in this film while trying to put down the heroine. What's more, in regards to the need for greater acts of violence, I was personally offended by the choice of making one of the victims pregnant, and on top of that killing her via a red-hot poker through the belly. The dude in the wheelchair from "II" was bad enough, but a pregnant woman impaled on a poker? Come on, man. That's just vulgar.<br /><br />Having said that, this is my personal fave of all the FRIDAY films. If you can ignore the many gratuitous shots of yo-yos and cigarette butts and popcorn flying at the camera to show off a 3-D effect you can't see, this is definitely the slasher flick for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>Seems as though the fans of the whole Friday The 13th franchise can never get enough. In 1982, director Steve Miner brought us another sequel entitled, Friday The 13th Part 3, Steve Miner's second turn in directing a Friday The 13th film, his first being 1981's Friday The 13th Part 2.<br /><br />  In this horrifying chapter, which starts off by showing what happened at the end of the second film, Jason (played by Richard Brooker) goes on to feed on more victims. Now, this sequel is sort of a continuation of the last film, just like Halloween 2 continued on from the first Halloween. First, Jason stumbles onto a married couple named Harold and Edna. Harold is an insecure man, who allows his b*tch of a wife order him around. Edna watches the news and find out about the murders from the second film (when this film is actually taking place only a day after the second film). At that moment, Harold comes running into the house to "make a call to nature". He finishes his bathroom business, but he hears a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom door. He opens the door and Jason knocks him off, where Jason then kills Edna.<br /><br />  The next morning, a van pulls up into a nice looking neighborhood. Inside the van are Chris Higgins (played by Dana Kimmell), Debbie (played by Tracie Savage), Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), Shelley (played by Larry Zerner), and potheads, Chuck (played by David Katims) and Chili (played by Rachel Howard). They are on their way to Chris' family cabin in Camp Crystal Lake for the weekend. Right now, they're stopping to pick up Vera Sanchez (played by Catherine Parks), a girl who is going along as a date for Shelley. Shelley is very insecure about his looks and weight. In order for him to get people to like him, he has to scare the ever-loving sh*t out of them.<br /><br />  The friends pull up to the cabin, where Chris is greeted by her boyfriend, Rick (played by Paul Kratka). After another Shelley-scaring-the-hell-out-everyone joke, Vera and Shelley drive off to the grocery store to get some food for the weekend, where they have a run-in with three bikers named, Ali (played by Nick Savage), Loco (played by Kevin O'Brien), and Fox (played by Gloria Charles). Shelley pays them back with revenge, but not before the bikers follow them back to the cabin, where they plan to set the kids' barn on fire. Before they even have a chance to burn the place, Jason takes care of business with the three of them.<br /><br />  That night, Chris and Rick go for a long ride, just to catch up on things. Chris hasn't seen Rick for two years, since she hadn't gone back until now. Her reason: she was attacked by Jason and nearly killed by him. As she tells Rick the story of her terrifying ordeal, their car breaks down, `causing them to walk back to the cabin.<br /><br />  At the cabin, Debbie and Andy have a little fun in the sac, until Debbie goes to get a shower. Andy goes for a beer, but is evilly greeted by Jason. Debbie finishes her shower and goes to bed, but she is then killed by Jason. Shelley again scares the crap out of Vera, this time where an old goalie mask. He goes off into the barn, all hurt from the way Vera yelled at him. But Shelley does not come back out; Jason comes out, wearing the goalie mask. He finds Vera and shows her how to play darts with just her left eye.<br /><br />  Chuck and Chili also greet their demise. Chris and Rick return, but Rick is suddenly killed by Jason. Chris is all alone to battle Jason. She battles him in the barn. As she battles Jason, Ali suddenly appears to be alive. He tries to help Chris out, but Jason really finishes him off. As he kills Ali, Chris grabs an axe and jams it into Jason's forehead. He drops down to the ground and appears to be dead. It is then where Chris realizes that Jason is the one who attacked her all those years ago.<br /><br />  Chris then goes off into a canoe and falls asleep. She wakes up and is relieved to find that morning has arrived. She finds Jason still alive and is running after her. As she tries to sail away with the canoe, she finds that she was only hallucinating. But at that moment, Mrs. Voorhees' dead body jumps up out of the lake and grabs Chris violently and pulls her underneath the water. But Chris is lucky to find that it was only dream. Chris is unlucky in the fact that she has gone completely mental from this whole ordeal.<br /><br />  I told you twice before: no more camping until Jason is finished having his fun. But watch Friday The 13th Part 3, if you've enjoyed the first two films.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>WHY IS EVERYONE GIVING THIS LOW RATINGS?! I mean, really! This is a landmark Jason film! He gets his hockey mask in this one. Cool kills, neat characters and the HOCKEY MASK! Just a classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.<br /><br />This installment marks the first film with Jason getting his trademark hockey mask. This film is gorier than the first two films and has a slicker look. The 3-D effect is more of a distraction than anything else, but the film is better than the second and more intense than the first.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks good and there are some cool extras on the box set.</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>I followed all the tips I read online. Wore both pairs of glasses, sat in the dark about 9 feet back from my TV, dead centre. For the most part the 3D works really good, especially when there is some solid reference items in the foreground. Adds great depth to the scene. The only time the image splits into two really obviously is when things come hurtling out of the screen and even then, not every time. There is some stunning 3D parts with leaves blowing around in the storm. Occasionally for no apparent reason thing with blur into a double image in the background but this soon rights itself. When its at its best the images look pristine so I was expecting the 2D version to be absolutely stunning. I was dissappointed to find it was quite grainy. I would recommend watching the 3D version in 3 half hour increments as it can give you a headache wathcing for too long.<br />The film itself adds nothing to the mythology but because of making use of 3D it force the dirctor to make each shot as interesting as possible andyou get a lot of great shots. Story wise its a throw away but entertainment wise it work well.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>My "Friday the 13th" marathon that began on Friday, June 13, 2008, continues with the next installment, "Friday the 13th Part 3."  And Jason returns to slaughter more beautiful, unsuspecting young people who have ventured into his woods.<br /><br />  "Friday the 13th Part 3" is very different from the first two.  I envy those who saw it in 3D and wish it would be re-released at the theatres in 3D.  Perhaps 4D and this time we can smell the fear of the victims.<br /><br />  This film is also presented in a much wider aspect than the previous ones, 2.35:1 versus the standard 1.85:1.  I believe I prefer the wider aspect.<br /><br />  The characterization is much better than the previous ones.  There is Chris who must've been attacked by Jason and survived.  She still suffers from paranoia because of the incident and imagines that someone is watching them.  The best character, and the most three dimensional of them all, is Shelly who likes to play dangerous practical jokes in order to get attention.  We all can sympathize with his character.  At one time or another, we've pulled stunts in order to gain popularity, only to regret it later.  Unfortunately, Shelly never seems to learn that people like him for himself.<br /><br />  I believe that I've always been afraid of hockey and hockey masks.  They make the players look so ferocious and evil.  And the ice skates they wear have blades that can slice your hands and face if they come in contact with them.  Shelly must've found hockey masks scary.  Why else would he be wearing one when he performs his last stunt to scare someone?  Jason also must've thought it would be cool to wear a hockey mask when he killed people.  Maybe that is why he killed poor Shelly and took it from him.  From then on, he wore it throughout the rest of his stalking career.  His competition, Michael Myers of "Halloween," had a cool mask; perhaps Jason felt that he needed one as well.<br /><br />  Great characterization and some gruesome, unique killings give "Friday the 13th Part 3" four stars.  Best scene is when the muscular gymnast walking on his hands is sliced in half by Jason's machete.  What a gruesome way to die!<br /><br />  "Friday the 13 Part 3" is a must have for fans of the slasher genre.  In fact, the first four in the series are the best to own since they have a great story to tell of how Jason Voorhees became part of horror legend.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>Jason comesback in this 3rd installment to continue his killing spree. This time, all the victims aren't teens, or even all young people... Anyway, the main character is Chris. A girl that was once before attacked by Jason and has returned to see how "strong" she is.<br /><br />Little does she know that the man that attacked her before is still around and looking for more victims.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is one of the better ones in the franchise... Yeah, we have people going on about originally... But it's pointless to complain as I think because everybody knows what these movies are before you even watch them. It's beating a deadhorse really...<br /><br />Besides, this movie attempted to add abit of a story with the Chris/Jason thing... It just didn't explore it well enough. But the gore, and the feel of the movie make up for it.<br /><br />We get some of the more gory kills and mood is good here. The film was in 3D at theaters and naturally you will not get the best of it on TV... But I enjoyed this entry due to the killings and the pace is better here. It doesn't hurt that Chris is possibly the best "hero" of the series.<br /><br />It could have got 4 had it explored the Jason/Chris connection that happend before.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Released on Friday the 13th-- August 13, 1982.<br />Now you can see Jason--the killer in 3-dimensional without the red/blue glasses and the blurriness.  The film is not in red/blue 3-D for this widescreen version.  The film will look normal.  objects will be directed at the camera.<br />  First you are treated to the ending of Friday the 13th Part 2 (in 2-D).<br />  Now the 3-D begins. The story of the film takes places the night after they find Ginny (Amy Steel) and Paul (John Furey). Richard Brooker plays "Jason".<br />  Edna (Cheri Maugans) is wondering what on earth her husband, Harold (Steve Susskind) is doing outside amoung the laundry.  They own their own general store.  jason finds Harold in the bathroom and finds Edna too.<br />  A group of teenagers and two adult hippies that smoke some funny stuff (David Katims, Rachel Howard) drive to Higgins Haven for a vacation and promptly engage in a skinny-dip in the lake while Chris (Dana Kimmell) checks out the cabin. She is quickly kissed by a horny campmate, Rick (Paul Kratka) she has been summer friends with.  Shelly (Larry Zerner) gets in he mood by playing his practical jokes, but the plastic ax trick wasn't funny.  Jason has his own plans and he is not joking.<br />When Chris discovers Andy (Jeffrey Rogers) and Rick, she knows that Jason has returned--the gruesome creature she saw two years ago.<br />  Tracie Savage ("Debbie") became a Los Angeles newsreporter.<br />  Director Steve Miner plays the newscaster on tv.<br />  This is the first time "Jason" puts on the hockey mask.<br />  Body count: 12 and Jason makes 13, temporarily.<br />  Next film: Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984).<br /><br />  A new "Friday The 13th" movie was released in 2009.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>I have always been a fan of Part 3 aka 3D! Jason is still just a man, not some zombie killing machine. Being that the early films are still somewhat grounded in reality, it made it all the more frightening to me as a child. Jason also has that scary retarded face, too. That really scared the bejesus out of me when I was a wee thing watching this late at night with my granparents! Kudos the awesome disco/electronica theme song! Jason cuts through the teen campers, drug addicts, and even a biker gang heade by a chick who looks like a young Phylicia Rashad! One guy gets his head crsuhed til his eyeballs pop out while another girls gets skewered by a hot poker iron. Fun for a Saturday late night  viewing!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7.html">A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7</a><br/><p>This IS the best of the Friday the 13th series!

You can't guess what happends next becouse your never right!!!!!!! This movie always surprises you!!!! It's about some friends taking a vaction to the woods not noing that is were Jason is. One girl remembers geting attact by Jason along time ago and is very scared because<br />of the events that are going on.  This movie rocks!!!!

This installment has a group of teenagers who go to a farmhouse in the country to party for the weekend, and the farmhouse just happens to be located down the road from Camp Crystal Lake, which means that the teenagers will eventually meet there death at the hands of our mutant maniac Jason. A welcome sense of humor helps this third entry in the series.</p></br></body></html>

Taking the setting to Burma to give the mainstream audience a view on how violent parts of Burma are, Rambo is revived in a triumphant massacre. This time, he's not alone.<br /><br />After being approached by a group of Christian Aid Workers, Rambo takes them up the river and into Burma. He starts to fall for one of the aid workers by the name of Sarah (Julie Benz) but they are both two very different people. Whilst on their aid trip in a small village, the village is attacked by the armed militia and the aid workers are kidnapped along with Sarah. Rambo, having left the workers behind, is approached 10 days later to help track down the workers. This time he has help from a group of mercenaries which will help him save Sarah, and take down the evil regime.<br /><br />This is a really good movie that, when involving the violence is no holds barred graphic wise. I can't help but think we've been lied to somehow as Sly has said in numerous interviews that he didn't use any CGI for this movie. This appears to be untrue as there's one part of the movie that we see a considerably large explosion that seems very much computer generated. Sly seems to be wanting to bring back the old glory days of the first rocky movies and the first Rambo's. With the success of Rocky Balboa and now with the success of Rambo 4, it's clear that Sly still has what it takes to give us a really good film. The only really bad point is the length at just over an hour and 10 minutes. Buy it, you wont be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>RAMBO WAS BRUTALLY AWESOME! I DIDN'T EXPECT MUCH TO BE HONEST BUT WAS SO SURPRISED THAT IT WOULD BE THIS GOOD. STALLONE DESERVES REAL CREDIT FOR THIS. IT'S NOT SAVING PRIVATE RYAN BUT FOR BEING AN ACTION MOVIE IT HAD A LOT GOING FOR IT. THE ACTING WAS SUPERB AND THE ACTION WAS THE BEST I'VE SEEN IN A LONG WHILE. I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF CHEERING AT THE SCREEN!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Enough action and violence to satisfy action fans.  Very very bloody.<br />*Very stylish filming style.  Even though the camera shakes around a lot, it manages to keep good focus on the action.  The photography ultimately serves well to capture the gritty realness of combat from Rambo's point of view.<br />*Despite being moody and silent, Stallone remains true to his character and is believable.<br />*This film is probably one of the most violent movies I know of, both graphically and brutally.  Much of this is focused on the injustices of the Burma regime, as they raid their own villages and brutally slaughter innocent civilians.  The film's main intention is to expose these attrocities, and I believe is it very effective and invoking (and thus successful).<br />*Very strong theme about the need for heroes or war fighters in society.<br />*Pretty good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not for the squeamish.<br />*Some of the dialogue is simplistic or dull (especially when the missionaries are trying to convince Rambo to go upriver; their arguments weren't very convincing, so it's kind of weird that Rambo agreed).<br />*The plot is ultimately very thin and simplistic (but this could also be a good thing, because its mercifully short).<br /><br />As a Rambo action movie, this one probably doesn't work as well.  But as a video-essay concerning the situation in Burma and the need for heroes in this world, it is quite excellent.  It's not "Schindler's List" by any means, but like "Children of Men" or "Lord of War," it definately highlights the worst, most brutal aspects of human violence and war.  You're probably not supposed to enjoy watching Rambo tear all of the bad guys apart, but after seeing what the bad guys do, you wind up rooting for him anyway.  Ultimately, the movie exposes the attrocities of a regime that would have otherwise gone unnoticed by the general public (I know I would have never known).  It's very rough and brutal, but if you can take it, it's certainly worthwhile watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>It has been many years, and apparently nearly as many pounds, since Sylvester Stallone made a Rambo movie, but apparently the extra weight and time away from the role just made Stallone hungrier to earn a pay-day from the character he previously played.<br /><br />Rambo, the title of the 4th film in the John Rambo story, finds Rambo running a boat through the jungles near Burma which seems to be very convenient as there is a war going on there with rebels being rounded up and killed genocide style.  Even as those events are going on, John Rambo is apparently somewhat content to round up snakes and do his own blacksmithing, at least until a god squad of Doctors and missionaries comes to hire him to take them to where the action has been so they can help the victims there.<br /><br />Of course in Rambo's world help would mean changing the situation and change isn't possible if you aren't helping to even the fight between the rebels and the cruel and sadistic military that is abusing them.  Rambo asks the leader of the group if they'll be bringing weapons which is met by a 'we don't support violence' type answer that he follows with a tart 'then you aren't changing anything'.<br /><br />Eventually Rambo is convinced to take the group where they wish to go though the motivation for his doing so is an issue that isn't really resolved in the cut of the film that is on the disc.  In fact there are a few places where the film does a poor job of fleshing out why some things are happening and just what the relationship is between some of the characters, all of which actually seem much better resolved and more detailed in the handful of deleted scenes which are on the disc but weren't included in the movie as released.  Of the scenes on the disc at least 2 or 3 should have gone in as filmed, though in one scene there were obvious sound issues that cause the dialog to be garbled and nearly lost (perhaps explaining why the scene was cut).  Considering the films fairly short running time (just over 90 minutes), including the extra footage probably would have made for a better film.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me looking at Stallone carrying the extra pounds (even as I could point back at my own expanding mid-section) while wearing long hair and trying to portray an "I've lost interest in the world" type attitude just didn't work as well as I would have hoped.  Yes the movie is filled with plenty of action, plenty of blood and guts (and gore), and a message that deals with when there is or isn't a time for violence or peaceful approach to resolving problems, but having seen the film I'm left thinking an overweight Sly Stallone in the role of action hero isn't a good thing.  It may as well have been George Foreman (carrying a bunch of his grills) on the screen running through the jungle, as that would have been equally as believable really.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film, and the story is worth discussion, but I don't think it was the best in the Rambo series either.  Compared to the earlier films the story may be better, but the passage of time is obvious to the viewer and that doesn't help the illusion that should exist in the film world.  Plenty of violence, plenty of shooting and killing, lots of blood spurting.  Be aware going into viewing that the film is fairly graphic.  Solid 3 to 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Time passes and we get older, Rambo included.

Unlike `Rocky Balboa' where we get lingering memories of previous fame and Adrienne's haunting presence, Sylvester Stallone brings back John Rambo after a twenty-year hiatus with nothing more than harrowing flashbacks from his Vietnam experiences.  These brief, yet skillful scenes are taken from past movies, cleverly revealing his inner turmoil, flashing before our eyes. This time they don't fool around.  Clocking in at 1:23, this installment of the action adventure series doesn't leave much to the violent imagination.  Stallone and company don't waste much time getting reacquainted with the audience.<br /><br />Starting in the present, Rambo (Stallone) returns to Burma as an ex-green beret seeking to free captive humanitarian workers (Julie Benz and Matthew Marsden).  Rambo's rogue mission finds him fully confident with few words as he works with a mutinous, motley crew led by Aussie leader, Lewis (Graham McTavish).  In one scene Rambo tells the volunteer couple, "You're never going to change the world."  Well, then, Rambo, what are you doing here?  I guess he does believes in change; he just doesn't agree with their methods.<br /><br />At times graphic, the combat scenes are well-edited and riveting to watch.  I can't remember the last time I've seen such a suspenseful, harrowing, and gruesome action adventure, but I can guarantee you it never gets dull.  (Women and children are often seen killed along with the military men, so viewer discretion is advised.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>Even though Rambo isnt as young, slim, or fast as he was in the first 3 movies this was still a great action movie. It's violent as one would expect so its for older teens & adults only. I'm glad Stallone returned to make this film (and Rocky Balboa). I'd definitely recommend this, especially if you're a fan already. I saw it in the theater and when I left I was saying how I have to buy this when it becomes available. Looking forward to seeing it on blu-ray!</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I wanted to hate this movie so much, but came away having been throughly entertained (in an extremly violent way) for 90 minutes. It was a blood splattered 90 minutes but it was better than I expected.<br /><br />Rambo has retired to Thailand, but he's still in top shape. Stallone of course is still in good shape aged 60. I won't discuss steroids at this point.... A group of missionaries are trying to helped the sick and wounded in Burmah. The people are living under a military regime which is brutal in the extreme. The missionaries are captured and Rambo ultimataly helps a group of mercenaries to get them out. The body count is vast, it might be a record for I know. If you have any problems with watching bloody scenes I'd give this film a miss as there are a great many which involve huge blood loss!<br /><br />The ending is well done, taking you almost full circle back to First Blood from 1982. However making comparisons with that film are a mistake as it isn't in the same class. The main reason is a lack of another major character to support Stallone. In First blood we had the always excellent Brian Denehy as the local Sheriff, in Rambo there's nobody.<br /><br />However overall I shall be quite happy to watch this again. Its not a great film but it is a lot better than I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>"Rambo" (2008) is the fourth installment in the Rambo franchise after "First Blood" (1982), "Rambo: First Blood Part II" (1985) and "Rambo III" (1988). I'm a huge fan of the first one, which I think is an action/adventure masterpiece, but the next two films are merely okay IMHO; although Sylvester Stallone never looked better and the locations are fabulous in these sequels, the stories are too comic-booky and the characters are cardboard. In other words, there's very little depth, if any. This third sequel makes up for all that because it's not cartooney at all and there's quite a bit of depth, albeit not much in dialogue form.<br /><br />THE STORY: John Rambo is alone & bitter and living hand-to-mouth in Thailand when a group of Christian missionaries enlist him to take them into Burma (aka Myanmar) to aid a village of people. Rambo strongly discourages them in light of the political instability of the country, which includes heavy persecutions and mass slayings, but they insist on trying to help so he does it anyway. Weeks later he learns the missionaries have been taken captive so he goes back with a group of mercenaries to bring them out, if possible.<br /><br />"Rambo" combines elements of "Apocalypse Now," "The Killing Fields" and the first two Rambo films and is ultra-serious & intense from beginning to end, not to mention it's probably the most violent film ever made. No lie. The picture powerfully illustrates the best and worst in humanity. The Christian missionaries are willing to risk everything to help the villagers, whereas the Myanmar militarists revel in slaughtering scores of unarmed people for "fun;" they're also shown abusing/raping women and boys. Obviously they've given themselves wholly over to the darkside of their natures. Such reprobates are only worthy of one thing: Utter annihilation.<br /><br />Numerous important themes are addressed in the picture (besides the main theme noted above):<br /><br />-- Bitterness/despair and deliverance. The beginning of the film shows Rambo in a complete state of bitterness: He's just existing. He has no friends. He doesn't talk much and, when he does, it's very few words laced with expletives. The male leader of the missionaries is completely unable to talk him into helping them. Two Biblical proverbs state "a gentle answer turns away wrath" and "a gentle tongue can break a bone." The female missionary (Julie Benz) knows this and skillfully talks John into helping them. Yet there's more going on here than just that. This woman with a heart of gold is Rambo's "golden connection" out of the horrible rut of bitterness he's fallen into. Despite his gruff exterior, she sees something in him, something in his eys -- a good heart, even greatness, a genuine glimmer however faint. Is Rambo helping the missionaries or is she the one helping him? John instinctively realizes the rope she's throwing him and takes hold of it. There's nothing sensual about their relationship, despite her (realistic) attractiveness; it's solely spiritual. She stirs in him the hope and faith he's been longing for for too long.<br /><br />-- Violence is not always necessary. Although this is the most violent film ever made it skillfully shows when pacifism is appropriate. Note the incident on Rambo's riverboat when the lead mercenary continuously insults John and tries to provoke him into a fight. Rambo completely ignores him, choosing not even say a word. In other words, he refuses to allow someone to victimize him and draw him into a conflict that has no positive purpose. It takes true strength to do this and Rambo has this strength. Indeed, John treats the guy as if he's a bothersome gnat. What do you do when a gnat bothers you? Do you break out a machine gun or merely ignore it?<br /><br />-- Total pacifism does not work. I'm a Christian and would like to point out that the New Testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism. Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves and murderers. Also, Romans 13 clearly states the righteous laws of human governments are God-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. The vast majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extemists who refuse to be BALANCED with the Scriptures on this subject and insist that conflict and especially armed conflict is NEVER appropriate. The lead male missionary in the film is such a person (which I found unrealistic btw), but he learns the error of his ways before the story is over. This is an important point: Some people are so morally degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice I said "ultimate").<br /><br />-- The possibility of Rambo's spiritual rebirth [SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this paragraph unless you've already seen the film and/or want to entertain possible insights]. Although the first two sequels are cartooney and lack depth they show Rambo searching for truth and flirting with religion and spirituality. In the second film he gets a Buddhist necklace off of the Asian woman he befriends (who, of course, dies) and at the beginning of "Rambo III" he is shown working at a Buddhist temple and helping out the priests there; later, he meets and wins the hearts of (moderate) Islamic villagers and gives his Buddhist necklace to a Muslim boy who helped him out. In "Rambo," as previously noted, the female missionary is key in John's positive transformation; at one point she gently asks him whether or not he has any family back in the USA. He mumbles that he might have a father, he really wasn't sure, and obviously didn't care at that point. She later gives him a cross necklace for helping them out (he wouldn't take money). Anyway, the end of the film shows Rambo back in America walking to his family ranch. Obviously John had a profoundly positive spiritual metamorphosis in the story. The precise nature and extent of this change is not known, unless there's (hopefully) a fifth film [END SPOILER].<br /><br />"Rambo" was written and directed by Sylvester Stallone and filmed in Thailand. The locations are magnificent.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: One reviewer said he went to see "Rambo" for some mindless action & laughs but was unexpectedly and deeply moved instead. The story only runs 80 minutes, not including credits, and it's ultra-intense from beginning to end. In fact, I don't suggest seeing the film right before you go to bed because you'll likely be too riled up by the onslaught of violence and intensity to sleep.<br /><br />"Rambo" is easily the second best of the series, second only to the first one; even that's debatable.<br /><br />Personal Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>To anyone laughing at a 61-year old Stallone's decision to star as John Rambo in a fourth film, Stallone himself says 'Take that'.  Rambo (just plain Rambo), not only completely gets the job done as an ultraviolent action movie, but it even has a thought or two on the world, and an eye on a real-life hellhole (Burma).<br /><br />Re-visiting the character who came to define 80s Reagan macho guy with guns, Stallone does not opine on the state of the world, or even philosophize on mankind.  Instead, Rambo is a man of very few words, a quiet, wounded shell living in the jungles of southeast Asia, catching poisonous snakes for a living, and basically being tortured by his past and his true nature.  When the action across the border invites a group of well-wishing missionaries, Rambo reluctantly agrees to shephard them along the river so they can deliver medicine to the terrorized Burmese peasants.  When missionaries get kidnapped by the insano Burmese military, led locally by a nameless guy with evil mirrored shades, Rambo escorts a group of mercenaries up the river on a privately funded rescue mission.<br /><br />What follows is nothing short of an orgy of violence, outdoing all of the previous Rambo films in its intensity and graphic nature.  Heads explode, fly off, arrows penetrate skulls, people get blown up by grenades, people get shot to pieces (literally), body parts are yanked out or off with bare hands, and when the smokes clears, yes, Rambo is still standing.  Game over.<br /><br />If one doubts that Stallone honestly did have something sincere to bring to the table, consider that he did film this in Burma, right before the top blew off and the real slaughter began.  Consider that he's that obsessed, that he'll depict the Burmese generals as the worst people on earth, then outdo even them as he blows heads up in the brain-soaked finale.<br /><br />Highly recommended for genre fans, Stallone is a quiet, brooding death machine with little hype and less to say.  This film deals violence and oppression in the world, the use of violence, and the perservering nature of the best and worst of mankind, and also the perservering nature of Stallone himself.  The world is a cold, ugly, violent place that clearly has many uses for violent men, but it also stages their necessity for the preservation of hope and good amidst machine-gunned torsos and decapitated noggins.<br /><br />And a note on the DVD itself: excellent job.  Of special note are the missing/deleted scenes, since none of them are missed at all.  The decision to scrap the sappy, extended, philosophical exchanges between Rambo and the main female character (who somehow is able to get through and convince him to help out) are totally unnecessary and would have (unacceptably) delayed the ultraviolence that all paid to see.  This is a trim, efficient film, and even though he claims that there is no 'Director's Cut' (since this is it), I wouldn't be surprised if someone decides to mess with a good thing and does, in fact, release a 'Director's Special Directorial Producer's Cut'.  Till then, this will do.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This is by far the best Rambo yet. It's the most intense and brutal of the series. There's not much more I can say. Bottom line is this is an awesome movie. A must own. If you liked the earlier Rambos you'll love this one!</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After nearly 20 Rambo-less years (1988-2007), I was a bit skeptical about what to expect from this film.  Sylvester Stallone seemed a bit old to be playing the lead role, and the character had been "on the shelf" for so long that his viability in American culture was very much in doubt.  Fortunately, though the writers/producers didn't get everything right, they pleasantly surprised me by providing a film that is quite enjoyable and worthy of the Rambo title.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this film explores a much darker side of the John Rambo (Stallone) character.  Found in the deepest regions of Indo-China, an emotionally lost and severely conflicted Rambo reluctantly agrees safe passage to a group of missionaries bringing supplies to the war-ravaged region of Burma.  When the peace mission goes awry and the mercenaries are called in, Rambo feels compelled to once again enter the war zone he has tried for so long to avoid.<br /><br />Really, the only glaring problem with this film is that the plot is very predictable.  You know that things will get screwed up somehow and that Rambo will be called in to fix the situation, so some of the Burmese-territory exposition is a little tedious.  If you can get past this, though, it truly is an entertaining film.<br /><br />The aspect that stands out the most is the brutalness of the entire picture.  What the film loses in predictability it makes up for with some brutal scenes that will really make you despise the Burmese war force.  The slaughter of women, children, animals, and the complete burning of villages are shown with no detail spared.  Plus, it isn't as if the brutality is just being played for bloody special effects, either.  Stallone did his research this time and tried to replicate the shock value of civil warfare/genocide, and the result are some very shocking scenes.<br /><br />What really sets this movie apart, though, is its focus on the John Rambo character.  Whereas parts II & III of the series were just shoot-em-ups, this installment actually tries (like the original) to delve into what makes Rambo tick.  In fact, a lot more time (the film is only 91 minutes long) could have been devoted to the inner-workings of the Vietnam Vet and it wouldn't have been boring.<br /><br />Thus, if you are at all skeptical about coming back to the Rambo franchise after such a long layoff, please dispel those notions and see this movie.  It is easily the best effort in the franchise since the original First Blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>As a child of the 80's I grew up watching Stallone as Rambo. I wanted a knife with a compass so bad after seeing "First Blood" I could hardly see straight!! But I have to admit when I first heard that Stallone was going to milk the Rambo teet for another film, I had serious reservations. But I guess having Rambo help create the Taliban in Part III isn't the best way for one of America's heroes to go down in cinematic history.<br /><br />I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed "Rambo", it's a violent gore-fest which tries to cram in message about fighting for "something" in it's 80 minute run time. The basic story is you get some bible-thumpers who want to spread medecine and "the word" to the poor folks in war-torn Burma, and they want Rambo to guide them upriver into this stinking hell-hole. Well you know whats going to happen from the first moment Rambo leaves these do-gooders alone, but how it happens is a whole other matter. When the bad guys make an entrance.....they make an entrance. People getting blown up left and right, ripped to pieces by machine gun fire..and it's not like the old "Rambo" flicks where somebody would get shot and fall down, when someone gets shot here you see limbs come flying off, guts come pouring out, heads explode...it's some of the greatest gore effects this side of the "Saw" films. Seriously it's like "Rambo" meets "Cannibal Holocaust".<br /><br />Of course the main reason to see a Rambo film is to watch Rambo get his revenge. And this he does, and in true gruesome fashion. More limbs go flying and more noggins erupt in blood spouts, and of course Rambo puts his hunting knife and bow to great use.<br /><br />So, is "Rambo" a good film? I enjoyed it. But then, I love horror films so splatter doesn't really bother me too much. (If anything I kept thinking that whoever did these special effects really needs to be hired for the next "Friday the 13th" flick!). If you are squeamish, then this probably isn't the flick for you. If you are looking for the rah-rah go America Rambo of the 80's, you'll probably be disappointed as well, as Rambo himself makes it clear he isn't fighting for country or god..he's just fighting for himself. Also, if you are looking for Rambo to be a one-man extermination squad, you'll probably be disappointed as well. This film is more like "Team Rambo" with several mercenaries thrown in to help Rambo out. But if you don't mind the blood, and just want to watch Rambo kick some butt, then you will enjoy this flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Hey, I knew it was going to be a tough, adventure story but this was a shock. I've never seen so many heads blown off, limbs blasted away with blood spurting out and holes blasted in the middle of chests and stomachs in one movie in my life.....and it's only 81 minutes long! (The last dozen minutes are ending credits.) Man, this is almost non-stop action and suspense/ Yeah, a bunch of it is overdone but overall, it still was an entertaining movie.<br /><br />After an absence of 20 years, Sylvester Stallone's "John Rambo" comes back to the screen. Rambo is the kind of guy you don't want on your college debate team but he's a number one draft choice on the field of battle. He's a man of few words and a lot of testosterone. With veins popping out of his arms like a 25-year-old bodybuilder, old man Sylvester Stallone looks more juiced than Barry Bonds but at least it makes him look the part, even if he does have bags under his eyes.<br /><br />Despite the mayhem, there actually was a small story with a decent message about making your life stand for something. "Rambo Gets A Conscience" could be another title to this movie.  Nothing wrong with that!<br /><br />One last thing:  this was nicely filmed, with fantastic jungle scenery. Kudos for cinematographer Glen MacPherson and director Stallone for some incredible shots. I cannot imagine how good this must look on a high-definition Blu-Ray disc.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Living hand to mouth in south East Asia John Rambo<br />doesn't want to get mixed up in the civil war in Burma.<br />A beautiful Christian missionary changes all that.<br />Can one old guy make a difference against just another<br />set of military bad guys who live off killing and stealing from their own people?

This Rambo movie is not only the best in the Rambo series, but it's also one of the best action movies of all time.<br /><br />Did you think that Commando had a lot of killing?  BAH!<br />Did you think that Saving Private Ryan had the most gruesome injuries?  Hardly.<br /><br />This movie is saturated with arms being cut off, legs exploding into bloody stumps, heads popping like over-inflated balloons, and enough gun-play to satisfy even the most hardcore, extremist gun-enthusiast.  If it isn't an arrow evenly dividing a man's skull, or someone's intestines being spilled on the ground, then it's an extreme amount of people being sawed in half by high calibre machine gun fire.  There's even a crazy-intense seen in which Rambo basically pulls off the throat removal move from Roadhouse, only with a little slower satisfaction to it.  About the only thing lacking is a Colombian necktie.<br /><br />The story itself plays second-fiddle to the incredible amount of action.  A church-group from Colorado is doing peacework in Burma, bringing medicine and religion to people oppressed by a militaristic regime intent on genocide.  To make their way into hostile territory, the church-goers ask for Rambo's services as a river guide.  At first he is hesitant, but the kind-hearted but deadly Rambo eventually consents.<br /><br />Sure enough, after Rambo drops them off for their jungle-trek to the villagers, the church-group gets caught in the middle of chaos, as the evil military members are senselessly slaughtering every villager in sight.  Once they are captured, it's up to Rambo to save the day.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a whirlwind of action, as Rambo leads in a hardened group of mercenaries for an extraction mission.  They plan on sneaking into the compound, killing anything and anyone that gets in their way, and saving the prisoners.  What transpires is carnage the likes of which I have never seen before.<br /><br />This version of Rambo is an incredible movie if you're looking for pure action and entertainment from beginning to end.  I haven't been more entertained by a movie in a very long time.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Out of all the Rambo films this one tops them all.  Directed by Stallone, this one by far is the most intense of all.  It has more action the Rambo's I,II, and III combined.  If you are a fan of the genre it's a keeper.  I have to say Stallone knows what he's doing when he makes these action films. He has the proper balance of dialogue and action with a good script this time.  It took Stallone 30 years; however, I see a difference in the quality of the scripts he chooses to film.

He plays paintball and tells everyone he is Rambo.... lol.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I'm going to review Rambo IV which I think is a really solid sequel that's the that comes pretty close to 1st Blood. It stars Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo & Julie Benz as Sarah the story is short & sweet Rambo takes these relief workers over to Burma but they were captured by the Burmaneese army. Stallone of course directed this & all as I have to say is that he really knows his audience & knows how to get the audience to hate the villain. So this precher or something tells Rambo that these people have been captured so Rambo teams up with some Merc's & they kind of remind me of the guys from the 1st Predator movie they were entertaining. I thought that Julie Benz was a decent lead girl & this was by far my favorite perfomance of Sylvester Stallone as the Rambo chracter. He kills a bunch of mother f*****s there's a video on youtube that has Stallone's kill count. Brian Tyler did a good job with the score. It used very little CGI as well it had a decent story that really drove the action. Of course Stallone did a good job with the directing which he has directed a lot of his own movies in the past I really think he understands his audience more than Jean Claude Van Dammme. So I'am looking forward to the Expendables this summer also directed by Stalllone if you love old school 80's action movies then you'll more than likely like Rambo IV. Now I'm going to talk about The Extended Edition It has all the deleted scenes added back in with some alternate takes. There are more scenes with Rambo & Sarah. The opening is John Rambo. During the opening 2 guys on the boat are playing with the cobra. Also added back in while Rambo is working in the hut Sarah asks him to take them to Burma again. Added dialog at the night scene where it's raining Sarah asks him to take them again. When Rambo is taking the Rrlief Workers up river there is a longer conversation with Rambo & Sarah we learn Sarah is a 6th grade school teacher & her & Michael are engaged. Also after Rambo kills the pirates different dialog is spoken Michael tells Sarah will come back next year. More lines are added when Sarah begs him not too. The part where Rambo sets the boat on fire there are flashbacks to what happend earlier. Added scene where Rambo is thinking about what Sarah said about going back to The States. Added scene where the guy from The Church prays for the captured Relief Workers. The scene where Rambo bandages Sarah's foot that was wounded added back in. It's a good cut of the film but both versions are the same for me. But you should get definitely for the documentary which is very good. Rambo IV  I really think it beats a lot of so called action movies in the past 5 or 6 years.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>During a time when John Woo has not released a good action flick in over a decade there is nothing strange about John Rambo making a return to form late 80s 90 minute "fill-everything-that-moves-full-of-hot-lead" ultra-violent action genre that we haven't seen in a long time.<br /><br />Here John Rambo turns up in the far east passing his time catching snakes for the local snake teasing shows (yes, this is for real) when a group of young American Christian missionaries ask him desperately to take them into war-torn Burma so that they can deliver aid to some local villagers. After a debate and warning them against it (especially without guns) Rambo takes them up the river into deep Burma territory and drops them off. The missionaries eventually fall victim to a very bloody genocide campaign that is one the film's most brutal sequences as even kids aren't spared from the sadistic attack. Rambo soon discovers that the missionaries have gone missing from their pastor who has arrived from America with some mercenaries to go look for them. Rambo is invited along because he was the last one to know where they went and feels a duty to get them back. The remainder of the film is a very bloody and traumatic search and rescue mission and lots of action from start to finish.<br /><br />If the question is "is this a good film?" The answer is "absolutely not", well not in any traditional sense that we know understand the word good, but then again do we watch Rambo as an Oscar contender? Exactly, of course we don't, so we change the question to "Is it a good action film?" Yes! Rambo delivers and even tries to throw in some brainwork in the mix, especially its overall political message, an interesting basic idea about trying to make a difference and appeals to the real world scenario of developing nations and the problem of genocide and child soldiers. Overall Rambo IV is squeezed in at the right place and the right time. It might not be the best Rambo and maybe Stallone leaves a little too much of the action to the mercs and not enough for himself, but it is a Rambo movie and that is what you came to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>I was expecting a joke of a movie, instead I really got riveted by the seemingly realistic and overall message of this picture film. Rambo is back!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Ignore the fact that this is a Rambo movie and some have the audacity to say that Stallone is past his prime.  This Rambo movie is not only the best in the Rambo series, but it's also one of the best action movies of all time.<br /><br />Did you think that Commando had a lot of killing?  BAH!<br />Did you think that Saving Private Ryan had the most gruesome injuries?  Hardly.<br /><br />This movie is saturated with arms being cut off, legs exploding into bloody stumps, heads popping like over-inflated balloons, and enough gun-play to satisfy even the most hardcore, extremist gun-enthusiast.  If it isn't an arrow evenly dividing a man's skull, or someone's intestines being spilled on the ground, then it's an extreme amount of people being sawed in half by high calibre machine gun fire.  There's even a crazy-intense seen in which Rambo basically pulls off the throat removal move from Roadhouse, only with a little slower satisfaction to it.  About the only thing lacking is a Colombian necktie.<br /><br />The story itself plays second-fiddle to the incredible amount of action.  A church-group from Colorado is doing peacework in Burma, bringing medicine and religion to people oppressed by a militaristic regime intent on genocide.  To make their way into hostile territory, the church-goers ask for Rambo's services as a river guide.  At first he is hesitant, but the kind-hearted but deadly Rambo eventually consents.<br /><br />Sure enough, after Rambo drops them off for their jungle-trek to the villagers, the church-group gets caught in the middle of chaos, as the evil military members are senselessly slaughtering every villager in sight.  Once they are captured, it's up to Rambo to save the day.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a whirlwind of action, as Rambo leads in a hardened group of mercenaries for an extraction mission.  They plan on sneaking into the compound, killing anything and anyone that gets in their way, and saving the prisoners.  What transpires is carnage the likes of which I have never seen before.<br /><br />This version of Rambo is an incredible movie if you're looking for pure action and entertainment from beginning to end.  I haven't been more entertained by a movie in a very long time.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>There isn't a lot of dialogue or even plot to this action film, but that doesn't mean it has no message.<br /><br />Stallone, still impressive at 60, brings back another beloved icon of film, John Rambo.  The plot is deceptively simple in that a small band of religious good deed doers want to sneak into a Burmese village to give some much needed aid and go to the one nut case most likely willing to take them up the dangerous river, Rambo.  While he thinks they are foolish wishful thinkers, he does take them up and does so without payment of any kind making one think that deep down, Rambo would love to seem the succeed somehow after all the violence he has seen.  He even says, in a rare moment when he does speak, that they, these religious warriors, have good lives that they should be grateful for instead of coming here in a vain attempt to change things.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Rambo turns out to be all too right in that their attempts end up getting an entire village wiped out and themselves held captive.  Rambo is then hired by a small commando group of mercenaries to retrieve the kidnapped church team and, naturally, all hell breaks lose.<br /><br />The violence, contrary to some critics, is NOT the type we've seen before.  The battle sequences are disturbing realistic and capture the brutality of war, especially a civil one, in all its intensity.  We see people literally blown apart by mines, 50 caliber machine guns, and bombs.  We see children crushed under boot in front of parents and parents hacked to death in front of their children.  We witnessed rapes interspersed with these other violent images.  It's horrific to say the least.  My heart sank as I watched this realizing it was probably all too realistic.<br /><br />For me the main theme of this Rambo film is a constant theme in our world today, "Man's inhumanity to man."  Is there anything in the natural world that even comes close to what we humans do to each other over land, race, religion, ethnicity, or social class?  I think this is what this Rambo film is all about.<br /><br />I know that Stallone is criticized for what some call a vain attempt to relive his youth, to bring back a franchise, and just plain old make money, and the fact remains that all this may very well be true, but these "facts" don't change the fact that this is a powerful film that is well-crafted.  Stallone has always been an excellent actor, screenwriter and director, and just as he pulled off a terrific end to his Rocky character recently, this is an appropriate end to his other much loved character, Rambo.<br /><br />I consider this film a must-see.  Either rent it or own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Sly might be old but the man still got it. A lot people has seen Rocky Balboa and loved the movie, but wait until Stallone gathers all of his strength and places all of his energy into making John Rambo, the fourth Rambo film of the saga. It's definitely not an upgrade from any previous Rambo installment; it's just the next one. The dialog is very 'Stallone-esque' (lots of cheesy tag lines that sometimes hit and sometimes miss) but tolerable if you keep your expectations realistic being that it's a Stallone movie.<br /><br />For Rambo lovers and non-Rambo lovers the story is simple enough. John Rambo tells the story of John leading a group of mercenaries up a river, and takes them deep into the jungles of Burma to rescue a religious group that have been taken captive after a village was burned to the ground, and the villagers were brutally murdered, one by one. I really enjoyed this flick During the movie he is referred to by his name John or as "boatman."  Stallone wants to distance his character from "super soldier" from the man Rambo was in the last two movies. He is no longer a hotshot. So no wonder he is not breaking teeth when he gets insulted by the leader of the mercenaries. It does not matter anymore but once the Rambo comes out he fights so ferociously as if his soul was already burning in hell for those 20 years after we last saw him in Afghanistan. As if his desperation, anger, sadness, guilt altogether explode on the screen. It's not pretty, it's not enjoyable and there is no easy way talking about it.<br /><br />The character development is pretty poor with the main character jumping into a trusting relationship w/ the female lead the instant he makes eye contact without any real explanation as to why. The chemistry between these two was virtually non-existent, but this was probably due to just poor writing more so than casting issues. This may have also been a product of the very fast pace of the film as it really jumps right into the action, but it wasn't a very long movie so they could have done it a little more justice by making it somewhat believable. I think they did a better job with this in First Blood. The team really put together a shocking and graphic representation of war with all of the 'bits and pieces.' I was smiling in amazement of how realistic everything looked and ashamed at the same time for grinning at something so violent.<br />Still, even with the flaws above it doesn't need a continuing sequel and I think Stallone knows that. Got to pay tribute to this man because he had portrayed one of the best Action Hero's and at the same time reminded us what an action movie is all about. John Rambo came full circle with himself as well as his character's realization for his fans. Any doubt that action movies are dead? Look no further, Stallone still got it. OHH RAAHHH!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>You know the critics hated it. And here's why: bad guys and good guys, no "nuanced" portrayal, and ... worst of all ... there are Christians in the movie who are not wacky, homicidal, perverse, sadistic, or hypocritical! It's Hollywood's worst nightmare, and certainly not a movie I would have expected to see these days. I can't imagine what must have been going through Stallone's head to be making this movie. I wish this DVD had a commentary or some special feature to shed some light on this.<br /><br />What can I say? It's a beautifully shot (color-wise, that is) ballet of brutality, post-Saving Private Ryan. Not for the faint of heart. The pacing is perfect, the violence is horrible, when inflicted by Burmese militia upon innocents, and cathartic, when they're themselves shredded into bloody bits.<br /><br />I had read criticisms to the effect that the bad guys were portrayed as "faceless" cannon fodder. Not true. They are portrayed as psychopathic, sadistic rapists and murdererers, and this is the true face of evil: boring as hell. It's why modern portrayals of villains, such as Wesley Snipes' character in Demolition Man, are surprisingly boring: you know they'll shoot their buddy in the head at the drop of a hat, just to show they're really bad. When it happens, big yawn. In the end, all really evil men look the same, devoid of what makes them truly unique or human. Faceless.<br /><br />It's a reminder that out there are evil men with guns, ready to wreak havoc upon whomever they will, and that they will not be stopped by appeals to conscience. And it's a tribute to the soldier who defends the weak, perhaps at the cost of his own soul. In other words, a world totally alien to the progressive mindset of today.<br /><br />Horrible things are happening in the world, and they're screaming cluelessly about ... carbon footprints. (Even though last year's temperature drop alone was enough to "wipe out" all the "warming" of the last decade ... hilarious!) Under Saddam, husbands were kidnapped by the government and returned in pieces, or fed into shredders, and whole villages were wiped out with poison gas, and they're screaming about ... outlawing plastic bags and trans-fats and SUVs.<br /><br />What can I say? I enjoyed this film immensely. It's sad when it takes John Rambo to remind us what's really going on and what really matters.</p></br><a href="../users/AG6UYD56VHOG1.html">AG6UYD56VHOG1</a><br/><p>People of a Certain Religious belief give this movie a low rating and those same people are what is causing America to collapse along with Wars Worldwide.

The film opens showing the cruelty of the current Burmese regime as they make prisoners run across a field littered with land mines.  That is one of the many things I appreciated about this film.  In today's politically correct Hollywood, foreign countries are actually made up so as not to offend.  But like Rambo, this movie shows guts, figuratively and literally!  Yes, the film is violent and graphic, but it moves very fast so the eyes do not linger on it, as it did in Apocalypto.<br /><br />The story finds Rambo reluctantly bringing Christian missionaries/doctors to Burma in his boat.  Some part of the hardened soul is touched by the honest and naiive/optimistic view of a female missionary.  When they are kidnapped by the Burmese army, the church's pastor goes to the American Embassy in Washington, D.C. for help, but they say their hands are tied, so the pastor hires a group of mercenaries.  Mercenaries meet Rambo, and the awesome action and story begins.  Every aspect of the film is top-notch: music, acting, and the sound engineering on this DVD was superior.<br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>It's awesome to see John Rambo back in action!

Rambo tries to tell them is a very bad idea, but Sarah Miller really tries to get him to, so Rambo does it. After they arrive and help people, some Burmese army people come and try to kill them all, showing a bloody carnage! When Rambo finds out, Rambo and some soldiers return to Burma to kill the bad guys and save the innocent!

It's the best of them all actually. It's short but sweet but certainly not cuddly sweet. Rocky Balboa was a bit better but still this turnt out better than I expected since I'm not a big Rambo fan.<br /><br />  I just felt like everyone but Rambo's life was in danger in the movie. He was too much of an animal here, I mean he's like Michael Myers type strong. While it's so violent and even some-what disturbing that you'd think Rob Zombie was directing it. Performance wise though Stallone still does Rocky way better than he does Rambo. Rocky at least has a personality. Stallone handles the action great but when he's not violently destroying his enemies he's frowning like he has a stomach ache.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Rambo takes people upriver. Returns. Goes back upriver to rescue them. That's it. The script for this could not have been more than 10 pages long.<br /><br />I walked out of Rambo in early 2008 feeling a little bit cheated. The credits rolled at 77 minutes and it felt like the film was missing a final act. Stallone said he was on a deadline to deliver the final cut of the movie, and, if given more time, THIS version is what he would have released first time around.<br /><br />Now running 99 minutes (with 11 still swallowed up by credits) we get a bit more character development, and a couple of scene re-arrangements along with a new on-screen title 'John Rambo'. There's not much more than that. The extended character scenes are even more repetitive than they already were featuring annoyingly circular dialogue that seems to go on forever without really going anywhere. The editing over these extended moments is really, really bad too. Lots of fades, lots of mis-matched cross-cutting, little sense of place or timing. Terrible!<br /><br />Rambo (or Fourth Blood as I call it) is, stylistically, a world away from the previous 3 movies. While the others were shot in lovely anamorphic Panavision/JDC-Scope, this one is shot in ugly, cheap, nasty Super-35. There are loads of fake filters too, which make it look like a hack episode of CSI. Stallone could have done better there. But the worst, the absolute worst, worst, worst thing about this film is the overabundance of incredibly fake, totally unconvincing CGI blood effects, which take me out of the film every time. I don't care if Stallone was on a budget and a schedule, he could have sacrificed some of his paycheck to improve this. He claimed the film was intentionally super-violent because that's what war carnage is really like. Fine, good for you. But when he uses dozens of fake CGI deaths it completely ruins and cheapens whatever realism he was aiming for (pun intended).<br /><br />I suppose it's a hard juxtaposition and a sad testament to modern day action film-making where everything is fixed with cheap cheats in post-production, very little is actually there before the camera, and nothing is really made to last. When you compare Rambo to films of the equivalent 10-15 years ago, where most of the action, atmosphere and effects were done in-camera, when you actually felt like you were taken some place authentic and real, it makes you long for a revival of action movies where the action and danger is tangible and not just an afterthought by a lazy director. I find it odd that First Blood director Ted Kotcheff was a 'technical consultant' on Rambo, when there is really no similarity between them. First Blood felt raw and believable, while Rambo feels overly polished (to disguise the numerous faults) and fake.<br /><br />Yes, I am still giving it four stars as I am glad that the Rambo story finally came to a satisfying close and it was good to see him return home once and for all, though one can't help but think that would have happened 25 years sooner if it hadn't been for Sheriff Teasle, but after the realism of Rocky Balboa, Stallone should have delivered something better. He has the ability, but was clearly just seduced by the modern aesthetic and attitude.<br /><br />This Blu Ray features a nice 1080p 2.40:1 picture that brings out all the fakeness of the camera filters and a very, very loud DTS HD-MA sound design. An 84-minute documentary is also included.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>For those who probably laughed at the idea of a new Rambo movie coming out, thinking Stallone is either too old or would return old school-like Rambo - think again!!<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone took triple jobs of Writing, acting, and directing the up-to-date all-out action extravaganza action movie of the year.<br /><br />We only gave it 4 stars because it was too short.<br /><br />The action sequences were some of the most realistic since Saving Private Ryan. Stallone actually uses his brainpan to have Rambo actually age gracefully, but still does the smart thing and aligns his Rambo with a group of mercenaries to help him out, instead of doing the past 'do everything yourself' action flick. Intelligent move.<br /><br />This is most definately the best Stallone acted and directed movie -ever! And his last Rocky movie was well done and well acted, but lacked somewhat of the explosive stuff that the first 4 had. But it still managed to grip your heart.<br /><br />Rambo rocks, and we really hope that Stallone keeps showcasing his still intact acting and directing acumen. Now that Stallone has finally returned in full force, with both a Rocky and Rambo one-two success, the word is that some smart producers gave Stallone the greenlight to create more Rambo action/adventure films.<br /><br />Can't wait to see this. Rocky ended with a solid movie. Stallone will hopefully end it on a good note, but continue John Rambo's adventures. Hopefully, Rambo will finally find someone to love, and a home to rest in.<br />(Of course this is after a bloody full-out action/adventure romp through Hell!)<br /><br />That would be the ultimate ending to the Rambo franchise.<br /><br />We will definately buy this upcoming HD DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>RAMBO(2008) Directed and Written by Sylvester Stallone.<br /><br />Starring Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz and Ken Howard.<br /><br />The Burmese Govt is currently committing genocide against its Christian<br />population. In Thailand, a group of missionaries asks expatriot<br />American John Rambo to take them up river into the country so that they<br />might render aid to their beleagered coreligionists. Reluctantly the<br />ex-Green Beret--still haunted by his past---agrees and completes his<br />task.<br /><br />However back in Thailand once more and some time later, Rambo is<br />approached by the group's Reverend to guide a group of mercenaries back<br />into Burma so that they may attempt to rescue the missing missionaries<br />who are being held captive by a brutal army and extermination group led<br />by a sadistic homosexual commander.<br /><br />However this time Rambo will not just stand by while others do the<br />fighting and dying. This time he will draw upon his old skills and make<br />a choice between "Live for nothing or die for something."<br /><br />First off it must be held against the film that the language, graphic<br />sexual content and gore is the most excessive that has yet been filmed<br />in my experience. This is not necessarily Stallone's fault but the<br />result of Spielberg and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN which seems have compelled<br />every filmmaker to tragically follow suit. It is a pity that Stallone<br />could not have resisted the trend since....as always...this type of<br />excess is numbing and severely mutes the film's emotional effectiveness<br />and important message. Stallone also apes that chaotic style of filming<br />combat that Spielberg used which filmmakers will learn to regret since<br />it renders battle scenes well nigh incomprehensible as well as making<br />it impossible to keep track of who lives and who dies. Again muting any<br />emotional resonence the battle scenes might have. The use of CGI does<br />not help either. One was unaware that high caliber shells---when<br />striking human bodies--turn people into cartoons as a prelude to<br />killing them. One did not know that..upon being stabbed or<br />shot...cartoon blood gushes from wounds. And this is really supposed to<br />be an improvement over the much maligned John Wayne war movie?? This is<br />really supposed to be "realism?"<br /><br />The above still holding firm, this is still quite a good<br />tight...running at a brisk 85 min...well directed war/action film that<br />has a strong theme, emotional power and genuine courage....the later<br />sorely lacking in our modern "I never met a genocidal mass murderer I<br />did not like unless they invaded Communist Russia in 1941" Hollywood.<br />While this is not a film for actors--the endless obscenities make any<br />true acting impossible---the handling of the Rambo character is nicely<br />handled and the resolution of his long odessey(unless Stallone goes<br />ahead with a possible fifth film) is moving. The plight of the Burmese<br />Christians is ghastly and heartbreaking. Stallone to be commended for<br />his dramatizing this terrible crime especially in a culture that would<br />probably prefer to cheer the Burmese killers on and, in any other film,<br />probably would have villified their Christian victims thus<br />indicating--like with their beloved Muslim Barbarians and their<br />outrages....that they probably "deserve it". Besides making a biting<br />comment about the utterly uselessness of smarmy Liberal platitudes<br />about peace in the face of such horrific Evil, the film also<br />rightly......and this appears to have slipped under everyone's<br />radar...makes a highly brave bit of insight by identifying the leader<br />of and driving force of the Christian exterminators as being a<br />homosexual. That right there gives the film more true subversive power<br />than anything else made in the last ten years...if even that.<br /><br />Due to the above flaws stated in paragraph 4, I tend to rate the film<br />below FIRST BLOOD and RAMBO 3 while being miles above the second film.<br />However this film has been banned in Burma becoming a much treasured<br />bootleg within the country much like samisdat was in the old Soviet<br />Union. The film is greatly appreciated by the Burmese Christians and<br />has been a morale booster for their forces fighting to survive. They<br />reportedly have adopted dialogue from the film as rallying cries.<br />Stallone has stated the proceeds from a "director's cut" will go to the<br />victimized people of Burma.<br /><br />So this much maligned film and its much maligned main character is much<br />more than merely a good film but rather is a force for good. Meanwhile<br />so-called "serious" Hollywood films have chosen not only to be bad<br />films but vessels of Evil and accomplices of genocide.<br /><br />What does that say about John Rambo and his film series? What does that<br />say about those who hysterically have attacked and maligned the same<br />for over 20 years??<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I can honestly say that I remember nothing about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHP3G">Rambo - First Blood Part II</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHP3Q">Rambo III</a>, and that's a pretty good indication of how far apart the quality of those two movies were in comparison the awesome 1982 original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5TVKI">First Blood</a>.<br /><br />What made the original so good was that it was the story of a guy wronged by prejudice that brutally fights back against a corrupt system. In First Blood, John James Rambo went from a regular guy to a viciously skilled ex-green beret that you do NOT mess with. In the next two sequels, there is no more regular guy...just "Rambo"...the mercenary-like tough guy that's here to do some damage.<br /><br />Rambo 2008 gives Rambo back a little of the regular guy feel. Rambo is living in what appears as a small fishing village in Thailand where he is approached by some missionaries seeking transportation up river to atrocityville (Burma). Rambo gets the do-gooders to their destination, but things do not go well at all for the missionaries when they come under attack and are captured by the Burmese Army. And it's Rambo to the rescue.<br /><br />The action is great (sometimes a bit over the top, but hey, that's what we're here for, right?) and, as fully expected, Rambo deals out some major just desserts to the bad guys. The fun is packed into a movie that only runs for only about 85 minutes...which is a welcome relief from Hollywood's binge of 2+ hour films.<br /><br />But the nature of knowing that Rambo is going to be this hired gun (again) to get the bad guys versus the victimized loner from the first movie made Rambo 2008 as predictable as they come for me. Nonetheless, I was thoroughly entertained by Rambo 2008 (and I'll certainly remember it versus the forgettable former sequels).<br /><br />Rambo 2008 is required viewing for action movie fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie was impressive and exciting.

It's been so long since a decent action film came out of the mainstream that this film is a total gut punch.  It more or less slipped in and out of theaters rather quickly and undetected.  A shame, but at the same time the film had zero hype attached to it, making it a more pleasant surprise.  Of course the critics panned this movie big time upon it's release for being too brutal and violent and short on plot.  I guess they forgot they were reviewing a Rambo movie.  But the reasons the critics hated this movie will most likely be the reasons action fans will love it.<br />Stallone wanted to bring the genocide in Burma to the people's attention considering it really doesn't get any news coverage at all.  In the film's intro we're shown some rather graphic and unpleasant newsreel type footage of actual atrocities in Burma.  Stallone tries to simulate this kind of brutality throughout the film.  Though Stallone has a bit of a message he's trying to get across, and we as the viewers do actually become more enlightened about what's going on in Burma, in the end we don't watch action films to be educated.  We want to see Rambo turning schmucks into pulled pork....and that's just what he does here.  Rambo is now an old and grumpy man with a chip on his shoulder who has long since flipped the bird to the rest of the world(and who can blame him after all we've seen him go through?).  His peaceful yet scarred life on the Burmese border is thrown all out of whack when some missionaries want him to escort them into Burma by boat.  After helping out and returning home only to find the missionaries have been captured, it's time to get his hands dirty once again.  This time he's not acting solo, he has the help of a group of mercenaries.<br />Those expecting a good chuckle at seeing an aging Rambo take on an army might be a bit surprised.  The tone of this film is grim, brutal and violent.  Rambo's not cracking any cute one liners, nor is he trying to impress us with his pecs(he spends the entire film in a shirt).  Rambo is old, mean, pissed off and kicking some serious ass.  The guy's so hardcore that he charges into battle with nothing but a bow and a homemade machete!  It may sound unrealistic(which it is) and a bit silly, but it works!  I think it's do to Stallone's directing.  The man does a breathtaking job of shooting action scenes.  The onscreen carnage is downright vicious and shocking.  Try thinking of the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan and you'll have a good idea.  Stallone must have been inspired by his son, Sage, coz the movie is bloody as hell.  An early attack on a Burmese village shows children shot and stomped to death, all in unflinching detail.  When Rambo gets his hands on a gun(and even before that) people are exploding into geysers of blood and body parts.  I'm surprised the MPAA passed this with an R rating!  Apparently Stallone is surprised by that as well.  He got away with it by convincing the censors that the depiction of violence was necessary to show the horrors of war.  I'm sure this is true, but I can't help but think he's chuckling to himself at the victory.<br />I give this the highest recommendation, no doubt about it.  Though it does seem to have a point to get across, in the end it is a mindless action movie at heart.  And us Rambo fans wouldn't have it any other way.  Thank you so much, Mr. Stallone, for putting the balls back into the action film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>As a huge Stallone fan, I really looked forward to 2006's Rocky Balboa. And it paid off dearly. So shortly after hearing that ole Sly was bringing back his other 80's icon John Rambo for a fourth time, I quickly was reminded how well he brought back Mr. Balboa into a new generation. This was going to be a cinch, right?<br /><br />Well, not really. After seeing leaked trailers months before the film's release, the public quickly found out just how graphic this film was going to be. Limbs blown off, bullet wounds spraying, and people just exploding like never seen in a Rambo film. And trust me, while seeing the actual film, they are still in there, but what would be left without them? Not much really.<br /><br />It seems old Rambo's been hanging out in Thailand, as a ferry boat captain of some sorts that reluctantly is rented by some do-gooder group that wants to bring medicine & supplies to a nameless area of war-torn Burma. Of course, minutes after dropping them off all Hell breaks loose, and eventually Rambo, this time paired with an amazingly stereotypical mercenaries team, must go in to save whoevers left alive. Do I need to say more?<br /><br />Seriously, I shouldn't expect Apocalypse Now here, but after the greatness in story of Rocky Balboa, which Sly also wrote, there should have been more here than just porn levels of gore and old Sly in a T-Shirt, demoted of course from his tank-top/shirtless days gone by. Even the baddie was weak for Rambo standards, with no lines or flair of past protaginists.<br /><br />Also, the runtime is awfully short, and it does go quick yet with that empty feeling. As for the disc, here's what got me. I saw the 1 disc version, and when it comes to bare-bones, wow this one really takes the cake. While Disc One of the more expensive 2 Disc Edition has commentary, featurettes, and tons of bonus features on the same disc as the movie, the 1 Disc Version is movie and that's it. Hell, it's even on a single layer disc. This wouldn't be all that bad, but considering that Disc Two of the bigger edition is nothing but the IPod version of the film, to release two different Disc One's seems really cheap. So even though the 2 Disc is usually only 5 dollars more than the 1, even if you "just want the movie", it still seems like a rip-off when most 2 Disc sets feature the same disc but with an extra one in addition to.<br /><br />Overall, I was slighly disapointed in my man, Sly. This could have been a more broader, fuller send-off than this. Sure, congrats to the man to get away with such graphicness in an "R" rated film (Jeez, this wasn't Unrated?...WOW!), but even gorehounds like me need a little more in between the head-rolling. Well, at least Rocky got the better walk-off in the sunset....</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>Okay, okay -- the script is mediocre and the acting is mediocre and Stallone is on steroids -- but I'll be damned, it is entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>A movie about the war crimes in Burma where a group of peace advocates travel there but get caught by the brutal army.<br />John Rambo tries to rescue them, and of course is able to defeat the whole army.<br /><br />Great Action. Really well direct. However very violent.<br /><br />The violence looks so real and is so graphic that will disgust you. You might need to watch the movie in 3 phases since watching it one shot could make you throw up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A group of missionaries convince Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) to take a break from snake wrangling in Thailand to guide them into neighboring Burma, where they intend to provide humanitarian aid to peasants who are suffering under the rule of a brutal totalitarian regime.  When they run into more than they bargained for, Rambo goes back in with a team of mercenaries to rescue them.<br /><br />The first Rambo movie was very well done and had a serious subtext concerning the shameful disregard of Vietnam vets after their return to the States.  The next two installments of the series were Cold War revenge fantasies that dishonored whatever noble intent may have existed in "First Blood."  With this final episode, Stallone sends his character off on a high note.  Most importantly, it is a riveting action flick.  However, it also dramatizes the terrible suffering and violence that occurs under sadistic strongman dictators.  This is the most graphic Rambo film by far, but it presents our hero as less of a ridiculous superman without taking anything away from his frightening efficiency as a killer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Not bad.. That was my reaction after watching the 4th installment of Rambo. This time round, Rambo has to rescue a bunch of dummies held captive by Burmese soldiers - in the most violent manner possible. WARNING: The last 15 minutes of the film is not recommended for the squeamish. Heads and torsos explode in a hail of .50 cal gunfire. No punches are pulled. In one scene, an entire village is decimated and the few survivors are forced to march through a mine field. "Happiness is a warm gun" indeed...<br /><br />Rambo's plot is just as politically charged as the previous three films. Maybe that is a good thing - people may actually want to learn more about the situation in Burma, maybe even write a letter to Congress about it. Who knows, stranger things have happened..<br /><br />All in all, the movie delivers what it promised. The "pacifists are stupid sissies" moral of the movie is dumb, but I was'nt expect anything complex from this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UA046AA3DXFD.html">A3UA046AA3DXFD</a><br/><p>It's a double-dip this week. We polished off Rambo after the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNG0">Forced Vengeance</a>. Sid the Elf doesn't want to start a "Paul is Dead" type of conspiracy theory here, but are we sure that it was Sly in Rambo and not just some guy wearing a Sly Stallone mask? All right, we'll move on. Why Sly decided to revive Rambo, Sid doesn't know. Maybe it was because Rocky Balboa was well enough recieved. Maybe because he signed a new 3 picture deal(Lockup 2 has to be in the works. Please, Sly!). Whatever the reason, Sid couldn't be happier that John Rambo is back enforcing American rightousness. Even if the old boy Sly had to have botox injections between takes, it was worth it. Rambo was killer--seriously.<br /><br />This time, Rambo lives in Southeast Asia. His existance is really simple and peaceful. Rambo actually seems happy, even if his first line in the movie was "f-off." He catches dangerous snakes in the jungle and sells them to a sort of circus. While he's selling off his latest catch, a missonary from Colorado, played by the priest from The Sopranos, approaches Rambo about renting his boat to take the group of missonaries into Burma. The plot thickens, literally.<br /><br />Not wanting to go near the sensativities about the Middle East, Sly decided on setting Rambo in Burma. He centered the film on the conflict between two factions there. In the words of Father Phil, "It's more like genocide." The missonaries want to go to Burma to help the group that is being slaughtered. Rambo expresses what Sid is sure everyone watching the movie was thinking: that going into Burma at that point is just a really bad, stupid idea. But, it's here that we see the softer side of Rambo. He lets Sara, who is one of the missonaries, played by the incomparable Julie Benz, talk him into taking them to Burma in his boat(there is probably the ultimate Quagmire joke to be made with that sentance, but Sid will keep this one clean). Not that we can blame Rambo here, she could probably coax Sid into oncoming traffic. Anyway, en route to their destination, Rambo and the gang encounter Burmeese piarates. Of course, Rambo obliterates them. He then drops the group off, and tells them they're on their own and goes back to the pirates' boat to blow it up and destroy the evidence. You know these Burmeese dudes are no joke if Rambo is covering his tracks.<br /><br />About 10 days pass and Rambo gets a visit at his home while he's asleep in his hammock. He is told that the group of missonaries has been captured(shocker) and a band of mercenaries has been hired to get them. Rambo then agrees to take the mercenaries to the point he dropped the missionaries. The leader of the mercenaries is a real stroonz. He argues with Rambo without John J. even saying a word. He even commented on Rambo's "thousand yard stare," saying that he's "seen it all before," and that he's "not impressed." Anyway, when they reach their destination, Rambo sets off to go onto land with them. He's told to piss off basically. Unreal. He goes another route anyway, unbenownst to the mercenaries. When they get in trouble, Rambo bails them out. He then organizes the group to infiltrate the camp where the missonaries are being held. He gets them out, but now they have to reach safety. This proves rather tricky, and ends up being the climax of the film. Obviously, Rambo and the mercenaries have a massive firefight with the Burmeese militants. This scene lasts for a good 10-15 minutes and is filled with a wonderfully abundant amount bullets and explosions. The best thing about it though was that it looked so realistic. Guys didn't go flying 10 feet into the air. They just crumpled against the ground. So, after they win(you knew they would) Rambo leaves. We then see him in his old Army jacket with his old bag walking along a road presumably in his hometown of Bowie, Arizona. He is at his father's ranch. As the closing credits roll, he approaches the house.<br /><br />If you notice, Sid doesn't make too much fun of this one, well except for Sly's new weird face. The reason for this is that Rambo was a genuinely good film--seriously. It did have a ton I mean a TON of explosions and guys being ripped apart by large caliber bullets which never hurts the cause. There were  262 kills in Rambo, more than the first three films combined. Sid was surprised by this figure because it didn't seem like there were THAT many bodies falling. The reason for our surprise: the violence was integral to the plot. It underscored the fact that what was going on in Burma was deplorable. In the battle scene, Father Phil picked up a rock and bashed an attacker's head in with a purely visceral look on his face. A more clear symbol of man's survival instincts Sid cannot imagine. Here is a man who vigouously denounced killing at the begining of the film, but changed when he had to. Sly must be huge on change. He uses it as a major theme in Rambo, just like he did in Rocky 4. And you know what? It's what pulled the film together. Sid really cannot even make fun of the scene with Rambo walking down the street at the end. It signified him coming full circle and finally excercising his deamons. Under normal circumstances, Sid would have been hysterical at this sight. But it was actually nice to see some sentimentality and a layer added to a character who, up to that point had been just a killing machine. So, kudos to Sly for a really well-done effort. See Rambo, it is one of the better action flicks around.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Stallone's mission to bring an end to iconic characters and films many of us grew up on comes to an epic finally with "Rambo". While "First Blood" will always go down as a classic for me, the other two Rambo films (far more commercial and the badly executed rambo III) are entertaining.<br /><br />However, this fourth and final installment of the roaming life of Viet Nam Vet John Rambo closes with a bang and I believe that Burma is still recovering from this one. You have to hand it to Stallone for carefully choosing the catalyst for the fourth Rambo film (the ongoing 60 year civil/genocidal war of Burma).<br /><br />The other aspect of this film is how underestimated Stallone is not only as an actor, but really as a director. Perhaps he may follow into the foot steps of Clint Eastwood and really take on a path as a director? His last two films were so good (particularly Rockt Balboa) one can only guess what his capabilities are in the future?<br /><br /> For those of you who haven't seen Rambo yet, BE FORWARNED. Rambo does not have the cartoony action in it you might identify with as seen in the second and third films. Rambo is "in your face up close and personal" graphic blood and guts with non stop gore through about half the film. Just think about the first 20 minutes or so of Private Ryan but its about 40 strait minutes of killing (allot with the 50 cal).<br /><br />So our plot synopsis is Rambo living his days out in Thailand as a boatman doing whatever he can to survive and leaving his life of war behind him. One day missionaries (nobel,yet misguided) contact him for a trip up the river into Burma, which he then reluctantly agrees to. The missionaries disappear, and Rambo is once again brought back into war and coming to terms of "what he is", a finely honed killing machine. With a small group of mercenaries, they plan a rescue extraction of the remaining missionaries being held captive. One their way out, they run into trouble with the Burmese army right on top of them....let the killing and non stop carnage begin.<br /><br /> "Live for nothing, or die for something" is the phrase that Rambo utters and is really the message delivered in this film despite the blood and carnage. There's nothing satisfying about war and that is another aspect of Rambo that I belive is missed as well which has been otherwise glorified by some the war films of the early and mid 1980's.<br /><br />Look at what the exposure of violence and a life of war/killing has done to an otherwise regular guy like Rambo.He could be someone who could easily be your next door neighbor?Make no mistake, war runins people on all sides whether for good or bad reasons and that has been horribly overlooked from some of the reviews I have read here so far.<br /><br />Well worth owning and watching...even better on Blue Ray and on a big flat screen TV. Read between the lines of Rambo, just don't focus all attention on the obvious(although it is difficult not to dwell on it).Stallone delivers on Rambo and it ends with a big bang as opposed to other failed franchises ending with a pathetic sputter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Given the decent job Sylvester Stallone did reigniting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N4SHPS">Rocky Balboa</a>, I had decent hopes that "Rambo" might be as good. Alas, not too be. The aging John Rambo is a snake catching recluse in Thailand, still having flashback nightmares about being a supersoldier and giving 'that 1000 mile stare' to show he's still in a war zone somewhere in his head.<br /><br />Along come a band of arrogant missionaries who want to save the world by sneaking into Burma (aka Myanmar) and giving out Bibles and pills. John Rambo stands in the dark rain and grunts things at them until the pretty missionary (Julie Benz) babbles some nonsense about caring and he cracks. Why Rambo suddenly decides she is worth changing his mind over is never given, he just does it. Then...Big Surprise...the missionaries are caught by sadistic Myanmar goons who think fun is betting on which POW will get blown up in a race through a mine field.<br /><br />Thus it is up to John Rambo and a bunch of foul mouthed mercenaries to extract the prisoners. They do so in standard comic book style, all smart-mouthed quips and great big guns. The goons are creepy torturing rape machines, and so they must all be destroyed, right? Of course! And so, Rambo and his motley crew rescue the fair maiden and her friends with unbelievable amounts of blood, explosions, splatter, decapitations and screaming. The final ten minutes of "Rambo" are ridiculously surreal and dopey, including the patriotic rah-rah of making a wimpy snot-nosed pacifist into a real man by having him bash an enemy's head with a rock. USA!! USA!! USA!!<br /><br />Given that you have no true idea why Rambo has a thing for Sarah (Benz) or why he'd agrees to take/save her, the characters have all the depth of a blood splatter. (Even as hyper-masculine as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EQ">Rambo: First Blood, Part 2</a> was, you empathized with John Rambo.) The mercs are a multi-national pack of clich&eacute;s who look down on Rambo until they suddenly decide to follow every order he gives. The missionaries, other than Sarah and Michael, are human props. It was hard to give a darn about anyone involved, as the whole movie is a gloriously shot excursive in mayhem. Unfortunately, for all the flying body parts and spewing blood, "Rambo" has no heart. It is as generic an actioner as they come, which is a huge disappointment after what Stallone did with "Rocky Balboa."</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>I downloaded the unbox version of Rambo to my Tivo (which by the way gives excellent quality to watch on an HDTV) and watched it last night.<br /><br />My wife is not a Stallone fan at all, and she didn't "want to watch any Rambo movie", so I started it without her, but soon she was in and watching and yelling (my sweetheart is a movie yeller) "Did you see that, did you see that?"  She like me was instantly hooked into the realistic feel of the action scenes and the evil of the bad guys.<br /><br />One thing I noticed that for all the realistic look to the battle scenes, they had a weird camera effect of old battlefield films from Viet Nam, and WWII. I don't want to spoil the film by giving away the story line so I'll just say this, Rambo is even more graphically violent than 300 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPLW">300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, Gladiator <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009QTS1M">Gladiator - Extended Edition (Three-Disc Extended Edition)</a>, or Braveheart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W8OM5Y">Braveheart (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, so if you are put off by violence of every kind, blood and gore (and brief glimpses of perversion), then this is not a film to even consider watching. However, it is a surprisingly moving film, that reminds us that there are bad guys in the world more evil than we can readily imagine. It is also a moving tale of acceptance for the protagonist. It is an action film that doesn't waste time on pointless dialogue except to help you understand who the characters are, rather than to be the story.<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is not a movie for everyone, but every one should understand at least on some level the lessons that this movie teaches.<br /><br />But that's just me.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>After the success of Rocky in 1976, Stallone would have a character that would go down in cinema history and went onto become one of the biggest stars in the world. In 1982 with the release of First Blood, John Rambo would join Rocky as yet another Iconic character for Stallone.<br /><br />But there came a time when all things must end; the 2nd Rambo flick was a blockbuster hit and made a total of $150-million dollars in 1985 it's almost like everyone in the US went to see the movie, but despite the popularity of the character Rambo III would only gross about $53-million and would put an end to the series. Even Rocky V would be a flop in 1990 and it seemed these two Iconic characters were done for.<br /><br />Sly would have success and failures, but by the end of the 90s it seemed like a lot more failures with some of his movies even going DTV. Once the biggest action star, it seemed Sly was a thing of the past, but that all changed with Rocky Balboa; a lot of people were laughing at a 60-year old Stallone playing that character again, but the movie was a hit and nobody was laughing after they saw Stallone could still pull it off. With the success of Rocky Balboa, Sly was now ready to resurrect John Rambo. There were still some people laughing due to his age, but there's that saying age is just a number and Stallone proved that.<br /><br />At the time of Rambo's release, Stallone was 61-years old and I'll take Stallone in his 60s over any of these so called action stars out there right now that are half of Stallone's age. Rambo is the return of the action movie as we know it. I can't remember the last American action that was this good besides Kill Bill. Rambo is as good as an action movie any country could produce for that matter. The last American action movie that is just as good if not better than Rambo was back in probably the 80s or early 90s.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Art Monterastelli & Sylvester Stallone and while the screenplay is good the supporting characters aren't really well developed, but I suppose it doesn't matter seeing as it doesn't hurt the movie and I don't think anyone watches a Rambo flick for the supporting characters we watch them for the Rambo character. While the script isn't the best it delivers on what the audience wants. And really at the end of the day isn't that all that matters?<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone knows what his audience wants and a lot of people don't realize that he wrote or co-wrote a lot of the movies he starred in; odds are the movies he co-wrote he did rewrites to better suit the script for his style. While I wouldn't say Sly is a great writer in the traditional sense he's a guy that knows what his audience wants and delivers that. Though with Rocky and Rocky Balboa, Sly showed how he can also be a great writer and was actually nominated for an Oscar for the Rocky screenplay, which he easily could have won.<br /><br />Sly also steps into the director's chair for the first time in this franchise and wow does he ever deliver. Stallone has many directing credits, but like his writing I wouldn't call Sly a great director in the traditional sense. Again Sly knows what his audience wants and he always manages to deliver just that. If anything though I really think Sly is getting better with age, which is rare. Most filmmakers as they go on they lose touch with the modern audience, but not Sly. I think with Rocky Balboa he proved he can make a great dramatic, funny and even touching movie and with Rambo he made an action movie as good as any action filmmaker has ever done. Rambo is suspenseful, thrilling and has some of the best action scenes I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Rambo is a borderline exploitation flick in my opinion; the violence is actually quite extreme for a mainstream movie and for a movie rated R. Nobody is Rambo is safe; men, women and even children are murdered. This isn't a toned down Hollywood action flick. This is a balls to the wall no holds barred brutal movie. You name it Rambo has it; decapitations, throats being ripped out, people getting shot and they just don't fall down and die they get ripped to shreds; arms, legs you name it, it gets shot off.<br /><br />The running time for Rambo is only 80-minutes not counting the closing credits so there never is a slow moment. The movie always moves forward. Rambo is light on plot, but hey that's the way a lot of action movies are. Rambo easily for me rates as one of the best theater going experiences of my life and the movie on DVD is just as exciting. This one is no doubt one of my very favorite action movies of all time and once again Sly shows age is just a number. Rambo has everything you can want in an action movie and more.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>RAMBO (2008) should be mandatory viewing for all citizens in the United States ?<br /><br />Why do I say this ?<br /><br />We as a society have had it so good for so long that too many of our people take our quality of life for granted today and thus sit back with apathy as warning signs pop up in front of us everyday that the America we loved and respected and was once great.... is eroding away from within every day.<br /><br />It's depressing to see this once great nation rot from within like the Roman Empire did before us.<br /><br />Along these lines, too many American citizens today know almost nothing about the world beyond AMERICAN IDOL and GREYS ANATOMY TV shows.<br /><br />No lie....... when my wife and I were leaving the theatre after seeing RAMBO (2008) a group of 30-something adults were walking in front of us.....<br />They commented to each other.....<br />"Is Burma a real country or did they make that up for the movie ?"<br /><br />YIKES.... we let people like this actually vote !<br /><br />Many people focus only on the violence in this film and perhaps miss the larger symbolism that Stallone often interjects into his films.<br /><br />Rambo, like many of us in our late 40s and older see people in power making the same mistakes, people becoming less thoughtful and considerate of others and basically see the damage caused by open door immigration and unchecked urban growth.<br /><br />It all seems to prove the old adage to be more true than ever........<br /><br />"Its a shame man's moral and social development fails to keep pace with his technological advances".<br /><br />RAMBO reminds us of the type of integrity and determination and self-analysis real heroes and leaders go thru in life.<br /><br />Unfortunately we see little of these noble characteristics in either cinema or real-life anymore.<br /><br />The fact that a 61 year old action hero can outshine and ourperform today's modern "heroes" like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt on the screen is also a parrallel commentary on where our society is today.<br /><br />We don't have many John Waynes, Charles Bronsons, Clint Eastwoods, or Stallones in our society today.<br /><br />Instead we have limp "dish-rags" and decadent morals and wimpbaits who like to cry, whine, gripe and complain about things but never want to step up and actually fix or solve any problems.<br /><br />Where have all the leaders gone ?<br />We certainly don't have any running for President in 2008 for example.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Twenty years after his last foray on the big screen in "Rambo 3", writer/director/actor Sylvester Stallone has resurrected one of America's greatest action heroes once more. After successfully reviving his `Rocky' franchise with the most recent, and supposed final chapter, "Rocky Balboa", Stallone indicated that he felt he should give fans another hefty dose of mayhem in the form of John Rambo, largely due to feeling like he had left fans a little disappointed by the events of the third film (though I still enjoyed it). Displaying that he is more than just an over-the-hill action star, Sylvester Stallone wrote the story for the newest installment in the `Rambo' franchise, simply titled "Rambo", along with directing and starring in the film, and take it from me he delivers on all counts with this film.<br /><br />"Rambo" picks up approximately 20 years after the events in "Rambo 3", as John Rambo is living out his life operating a longboat along the Salween River in Northern Thailand. However, Rambo's quiet existence has just been interrupted when a Christian missionary group arrives, seeking Rambo's help in crossing the border into war-ravaged Burma. Reluctantly, Rambo agrees to assist the missionaries with the understanding that he would merely be dropping them off into the country and nothing more, but when the group is captured by the ruthless Nationalist Army that controls the area, John Rambo must once more wreak havoc on those that would attack the innocent, and attempt to rescue the prisoners, no matter the cost.<br /><br />For me, "Rambo" is a welcome return from Hollywood exile for an iconic action hero that knows how to get the job done and get it done right. His return, though much more violent than the previous three films, was extremely triumphant in my eyes. Many critics, not surprisingly, felt the movie was brainless, featuring overly simplistic villains, average to below average acting, and so much gratuitous violence that it would possibly make Quentin Tarentino (director of the extremely violent `Kill Bill' movies) turn away. I don't know why the critics hated this movie so much, I felt that this movie was just as good, if not better, than the first and second films, and definitely better than the third film which was good but not as great as its predecessors.<br /><br />The acting was solid, and was exactly what I expected from a movie such as this, it's not like anyone went into the movie looking to hand out Oscars to the cast or anything like that, and to me, Sylvester Stallone ("Rocky Balboa") handled Rambo perfectly. From his steely gaze, world weary outlook, and his no-fuss, never quit attitude, Stallone delivered to audiences a performance that was realistic for that character, making him seem more in line with the all-business attitude the character had in the first two films, yet seemed to have less of with the one-liner spewing persona in "Rambo 3". The supporting cast that comprised the team of mercenaries assisting Rambo on his mission were essentially character actors that I'd seen before, though I couldn't really place them in anything specific; regardless, each actor played their individual characters with a ruthlessness and thirst for money and violence that fit perfectly with their characters' lot in life. The missionaries that Rambo assists are led by a man named Michael, played by Paul Schulze (TV's "The Sopranos"), who comes off as a weak man who can't see the harsh reality in front of him until it's too late, and he seemed to possess a rather off-putting holier-than-thou mentality that is doesn't fit in with the self-less work of a missionary. Portraying the other main member of the missionary group is actress Julie Benz ("The Punisher: War Zone") who portrays her character of Sarah as a woman whose warmth can melt even the coldest heart, and her compassion for others is a true testament to her faith in humanity and God above, a true representation of the missionary spirit.<br /><br />The story for "Rambo" was a well-conceived, hard-hitting, and extremely fast-paced return for the title character, and Stallone along with co-writer Art Monterastelli ("The Hunted") easily silence all the nay-sayers that said another `Rambo' movie would never work for today's audiences. The characters are well-written and in some cases are given a surprising amount of depth for an action movie. Now, I'll admit that some of the characters are not as developed as others; but then again, this is an action movie, not some heavy dramatic Oscar contender, so what do you expect? As far as the excessive action of the story is concerned, I don't feel that it was any more gratuitous or over-the-top than any other action movie these days, and to me, I thought that the action was very realistic and necessary given the circumstances of the movie. Plus, I'm sure if someone was to go back and look at past reviews of those critics that ripped "Rambo" for being overly violent, you would find that these very same critics most likely praised the excessive, extremely bloody, and senseless violence of the two `Kill Bill' films, so I wouldn't take their comments in that regard too seriously.<br /><br />"Rambo" is a superbly triumphant return for America's jaded action hero, John Rambo. Full of enough action to keep even the most ardent of action junkies satisfied, along with surprisingly well-written characters and dialogue for an action movie, and not to mention the film was also able to shed some light on the disturbing reality that exists over in Burma or Myanmar, or whatever it's actually called. Overall, "Rambo" delivers audiences a pulse-pounding sequel that easily lives up to the excitement and adventure of its predecessors and possibly surpasses them all in the end.<br /><br />"Rambo" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have always liked the original 'First Blood' film, but I hated both Rambo 2 and 3, so I had little desire to see this new entry in the series.

Nonetheless, the lack of a deep emotional connection to the movie (of the type in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>) means this film only gets three stars.

In this film, don't expect much more than that.  It's extremely graphic without much more to fall back on.  The setup is simplistic--missionaries want to do the right thing by bringing aid to those oppressed by the Burmese Army, and nothing about it goes well.<br />Everything about this film is an effort to exhibit the most gross aspects of battle, with almost no character development, minimal context, no chemistry amongst the cast.  Even the action can't stand without a blood bath.  The only other notable facet of this film is trying to figure out what cosmetic surgery Stallone has done.

As a punch-them-up thriller with lots of explosions and gory, bloody scenes it works pretty well. Sly is a bit too old to be running around killing people, but the script gives him plenty of reason to stay in one place and puts a lot of action onto the other cast members. The action sequences are done decently, but the acting from the cast (not so much from Stallone as from everyone else) is subpar even for an action film. Also, Stallone must be a 24 fan because he freely steals Jack Bauer's conviction from season 6, "Live for nothing or die for something." Overall, this is a pretty high-paced action film but it feels mostly strained and the terrible acting weighs it down. But it should be commended, if ever so slightly, on bringing the Burmese situation (and, therefore, the situation of all ailing, fighting, and struggling countries) to the attention of the American audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>There's something inherently distasteful about taking a real-life tragedy - the genocide in Burma - and using it as fodder for yet another fantasy-fueled "Rambo" movie.<br /><br />After a 18-year hiatus, Sylvester Stallone returns to one of his two signature roles (the other, of course, being Rocky) - that of Vietnam War vet, John Rambo, the world-weary and cynical reluctant warrior who, in this installment, is hired to lead a group of mercenaries into Burma to rescue some American missionaries being held captive there.  Rambo may not be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but he is certainly capable of wiping out a whole cadre of Burmese soldiers all by his lonesome.  The poor people being systematically slaughtered under that regime will, I'm sure, be relieved to hear he's on his way.<br /><br />Despite a terrifically high body count and endless footage of stomach-churning carnage, it's amazing just how utterly dull an action movie "Rambo" turns out to be.  Stallone, as always, mumbles and grunts his way through his part, which, considering the laughably pretentious dialogue assigned to him (especially in "reflective" voiceover narration), is probably the wisest choice he could have made under the circumstances.  Graham McTavish displays some fire in the belly as a belligerent mercenary, but he's the only one on either side of the camera who seems to be putting any real effort into the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>...not that I was expecting much in the first place. However, I have been asked by a few individuals to write a critique of this film, and so I have. I've never been a huge Rambo fan, and this film didn't change that for me. I've seen many dumb films in my life. Most of them are in the "so bad, they're good" category - as in all of Ed Wood's films and anything by William Castle - only they knew how to make B-movies FUN.<br /><br />This new installment of RAMBO (and hopefully the last) is so incredibly stupid, that I cannot believe that it was even greenlit in the first place. Sylvester Stallone is not an idiot. I've seen him in interviews, and he seems like a really cool, intelligent individual. He's even working on an upcoming bio-pic on Edgar Allen Poe, that he is planning to direct. I just don't see why he would waste his time on this disaster of a film, when he could have spent all of that time and energy on his POE project. Who knows? POE might actually be his first masterpiece, if he can stop wasting his time on blown up, macho doo-doo like this.<br /><br />Of course, there are those who care nothing for quality film - no doubt the types that would label indie and foreign films "stupid" will likely get a kick out of Rambo. It is a film for neanderthals, plain and simple. There is plenty of carnage, yes, but it has no soul. There is an inherent lack of creativity from the opening credits onward. This film was marketed to a certain audience - beer guzzling, uneducated rednecks who like to watch things go "boom boom". They can have Rambo.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>Rambo tries desperately to be something it isn't, a horrifying look at the brutality of war and its effects on a country and a run and shoot action film. Although movies have been done which blend action and war drama, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000095WW8">Tears of the Sun (Special Edition)</a>99.9% of the time trying to fuse these completely polar opposite genres together is asking for a disaster. In Rambo, on one hand, you have the senseless brutality of war and genocide shown in a very shocking, and I'd say unnecessary fashion in order to play the "realism" card and try to invest the audience into the film; on the other had you have a mindless shoot em up action flick which completely contradicts any earlier attempts to establish this film as a serious look at war.<br /><br />The story starts out in Thailand, where Rambo, for some reason, has been living in the jungles since the end of the last movie catching snakes and selling them. One day, from out of the blue, a group of missionaries sent from a church in Colorado ask him to take them upstream into the neighboring country of Myanmar where they plan on helping the oppressed people living there who are being massacred by their government. At first Rambo refuses, but after the hot blond girl touches his arm and asks him nicely he changes his mind. Who knew John Rambo was such a sucker for the ladies? After he drops them off, their village gets attacked and they are taken prisoner, and big bad Rambo now has to save the day, as always. Can't a guy catch a break?<br /><br />The writers of this movie should be shot dead where they stand, or better yet Rambo should pull off his Legolas impression and shoot them though their necks. They couldn't even get the name of the country right, its called Myanmar people, not Burma. It hasn't been called Burma in years; that's like calling Thailand Siam or Russia the Soviet Union. It's an unforgivable mistake that made it almost impossible for me to take this movie seriously. Stallone, like always, gives us nothing but bad one liners and incomprehensible babble. The dialogue consists of the F word, bad one liners, fake crying, and little else. Rambo says "let's go" a lot, the mercenaries sent to help take the missionaries back say f*ck, and then everyone goes on a bloody rampage though the jungle. Acting? Script? Naw, forget about it, who needs all that when you can toss buckets of blood and rape onto the screen?<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention the violence? Yeah, there's a LOT of it. I'm a big action movie junky, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5S5">The Terminator</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EMO">Predator (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>, you name it I love it, but this new Rambo took it to a level where it didn't have to go. The senseless violence and raw brutality felt very out of place for a gun ho shoot em up action flick. As I said before, this movie tries to be something it quite frankly has no hope of being. For a great film on the realities of war, watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBLVI">Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXSS">Band of Brothers</a>, or for a more personal touch try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006HAWP">Grave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063K2C">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>. In Rambo, we are treated to all the harsh punishment we'd expect from a serious war film, mass killing, rape, torture, recruiting small children into the army, but are left with none of the emotional aftershock commonly associated with such films. There is no attempt to make the brutality personal or meaningful, just to make it as gross and disgusting as humanly possible. Anyone can show genocide, rape and torture, it takes a true visionary to make it feel real. That's what movies like Saving Private Ryan and Grave of the Fireflies do accomplish; that is what Rambo fails at the most.<br /><br />The extra star I gave this movie is for the action, and no I don't mean rapes and the needless bloodshed, I'm talking about when Rambo rips a guys Adams apple out of his neck, and when he slices the guts out of a man and then blows off the heads of one hundred soldiers with a 50 caliber machine gun at point blank range. It is over the top, it is gory, and yes I did roll my eyes every now and then, but it was fun. This is what the movie should have been all about, action, not a Platoon (Special Edition) want to be.<br /><br />Overall I'd say that besides the monumental disaster that was Rambo III this has got to be the weakest of the series. You can't be both Transformers and Saving Private Ryan at the same time; you have to be one or the other. Rambo is a rental, and nothing more. Do yourself a favor and see something else.<br /><br />Re-watch value; moderate.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>When Sylvester Stallone announced that he was resurrecting the Italian Stallion in a new Rocky film, "Rocky Balboa", most people, fans, critics, etc., thought it was hilarious, a bad idea, and way too late. Those very people ate their words when the film came out and got great critical acclaim, and was a nice hit at the box office. "Rocky Balboa" was the perfect end for the legacy. A surprising film filled with a lot of heart and character. The best Rocky since the classic original. So, with that success, what would Sly do next?. Why, resurrect the other iconic character he has. One John Rambo. Again, just like with Rocky, the public laughed at the thought. Rambo?. Stallone pulled off the unexpected with "Rocky Balboa", but could he do it again?. Could Sly strike lightning twice?. In one way, yes. In another, not quite. We'll get to that in a bit. One way or the other, what Stallone did was deliver the biggest and bloodiest Rambo yet. As Randy from "Scream 2" says - "Carnage candy!". So, what is it all about?.<br /><br />We find John Rambo catching and selling snakes in Thailand, and boating around. He is years removed from his adventures of yesteryear and is just living life. That all changes when he is approached by a group of missionaries(featuring Julie Benz, 'Darla' to us "Buffy" fans), who want him to take them on his boat into Burma, an incredibly war torn place, to help aid there. Of course, just as you would expect, it all doesn't go too well, and before long, Rambo is back in action hero mode when he has to invade the place to help rescue them.<br /><br />The plot of the film may not be a giant leap, but it works. And this is Rambo, after all. Sure there has been the angry bitter vet we knew in the past films, but it all comes down to action and explosions. How much stuff does Rambo blow up?. How many people does he kill?. The very, very short answer for that is - A LOT!. Seriously, this is one of the most violent, bloody movies I think I have ever seen. I've seen a lot of stuff in my day, but even I was surprised and taken away by the sheer amount of violence in this film. It pulls no punches. The end shoot out made the storming of the beach scene in "Saving Private Ryan" look like something out of a Disney film. It is brutal. And don't ask me what the end body count is. I lost count. If that's what you want in your movies, or in your Rambo movie, then you will most definitley not be disappointed in the least. Stallone also directs the violence and the action scenes in the film with such ferociousness that it really does feel like it's actually real. Sly did a bang up job in that area. No doubt about it.<br /><br />And then we comes down to the cast, the acting, and so on. Really, it's Stallone's show here people. I'm not complaining whenever Julie Benz shows up, but most of the cast is there to be kidnapped, or shoot guns. It's all about Stallone. Look, Stallone may never win the Best Actor Oscar, but he brings his Rambo and Rocky to life. He writes these films, and has directed a good many of them too. Some may mock and make fun of the Slyster, but there is no doubt that he is a very talened guy, and is probably far smarter than a lot of people give him credit for. He may be over 60 now, but would you of thought so if you didn't already know that piee of info?. I know I wouldn't. He jumps into the role full on from the get go and is just as capable and incredibly strong and buffed in this as any of the other three films in the series. He looks great. I know he could probably whip me with one hand tied behind his back. Looks and acting aside, John Rambo may not resonate with the people as much as Rocky did/does. In that regard, the movie doesn't come close to reaching the heart and spirit of "Rocky Balboa", but Rambo, the movie and character, is what it's always been. Fun, heroic, action packed, and entertaining.<br /><br />"Rambo" was a welcome return. To me, Stallone succeeded with this film in the way he did with "Rocky Balboa" because, for starters, I thought it was a good movie. It delivered the goods one usually expects from a Rambo movie, and then ups the ante. It showed that yes, Stallone could do it again, both as the actor and that the character can still hold up. He was up for the challenge. He passed with flying colors in my book. Where it doesn't quite succeed like "Balboa", was that Rocky felt finished. Like it had come full circle and was done. With a Rambo 5 already being talked about, I guess Sly knew he was not done with this character. "Balboa" also hits on a more human and emotional level. The type of character work and study is not quite apparent in "Rambo". The ending of the film was very interesting. Maybe Rambo 5 will have more of what I am talking about?. It certainly ends in a way that makes a Rambo 5 intriguing.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to say how deeply missed Richard Crenna is. He was a fine man and a great actor. He was as much a big part of these movies as Stallone. It seems weird not having him around. It was nice that he was shown in a flashback scene. At least they got him in there somehow.<br /><br />Rambo 5?. Bring it on!</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>It was rather simple and obvious, and he was speaking to himself, but every so often it plays in my head, and realizing my very strong interest in it, I always see him as speaking directly to me:<br /><br />"War is in your blood"<br /><br />War is in my blood. [...] I am irrevocably obsessed with it, as I am a military historian.<br /><br />"Rambo" was something I didn't care at all about, until a YouTube video featuring one of my favorite Iced Earth songs features scenes from this movie in it.  Particularly, the final action sequence.<br /><br />And so that drew me in to see it.<br /><br />Comparing him to the Rambo I saw later in "First Blood" and "First Blood II" I see a journey that is nearly complete.  The 'aw-shucks' sort of kid in the beginning of "First Blood" hardened and closed up like a stone by this film.  John Rambo rarely says anything, and it's not for wont of sparing the audience his heavily slurred voice.<br /><br />Right from the start, Stallone indicates he is using the backdrop of the film to highlight the 60 year running civil war in Myanmar/Burma, largely between the reigning military junta and the Karin people.  We get lots of sequences (not real footage, but part of the film) of 'games' the military plays, by tossing mines into shallow riverbanks, and having prisoners run across, and placing bets on which ones will make it across without hitting a mine.  We also get a sequence of a raid on a village, "recruitment" as it is, as the military snatches away young boys to be broken in as soldiers, and threatens the villagers with extermination if they try to resist.<br /><br />John Rambo, meanwhile, is a practical man, who realizes he can't do anything about it, and that seemingly he doesn't care, even though Sylvester Stallone clearly does.<br /><br />And what really stood out for me in this was that Stallone is very clear in his message that while peace is good, and it's very insightful and honorable to go to countries such as Burma with only peaceful intentions of medicine and religion, quite frankly, as Rambo says, you aren't changing a thing in Burma with peace.<br /><br />"Rambo" makes it clear that Burma is among the worst of Asian countries, in a perpetual state of war, and that the oppressive military runs rampant over the villages, which are presumably Karin though the movie never explicitly shows them, perhaps in a message that the Karin people are not so vastly different from the rest of the Burmese.  If it isn't the military, it's pirates who are not willing to negotiate money over the chance to rape hot white ass (Sarah's ass), prompting Rambo to kill again, perhaps the first time in years.<br /><br />Once the missionaries (lead among them being Sarah and Michael, played by Julie Benz and Paul Schulze) arrive at a village and do good work, they are attacked by the military seemingly within hours, and the survivors captured because they are white.<br /><br />This prompts the core of the movie to unfold; action violence, as Rambo shuttles a team of plucky mercenaries, memorably the asshole Brit, into Burma, and eventually goes himself to their aid.<br /><br />This starts a series of action scenes that does not stop until the end, from the first encoutner during a second scene featuring the mine-running game (and, quite frankly, a goddamn awesome 'trick-shot' with Rambo hitting a Burmese soldier with an arrow, and sending him flying several feet to explode on a landmine in the water), a stealthy-nighttime rescue mission, and a dash through the woods to escape, where the Brit gets his leg shredded by a mortar, and Rambo's use of a Claymore to throw off the Burmese military and detonate a World War II bomb left unexploded in the jungle.<br /><br />This all leads up to the final action sequence, in which the mercenaries and missionaries (minus the sniper and Sarah) are lined up about to be executed, when Rambo appears to the rescue, with a .50 caliber mounted machine gun at hand.<br /><br />When I had complained about "First Blood"'s lack of genre-defining violence, I fear I may have been spoiled by this movie, though I was at least understanding in recognizing that what I saw here could possibly never have been shown in 1982.<br /><br />For about ten minutes at the end of "Rambo", we're given quite possibly the absolute goriest, most realistically bloody action sequence ever depicted in any movie of its kind; from the start with Rambo swinging a machete hard enough to decapitate a man in one swift stroke, to the gore-soup staining the face-guard of the machine gun.  Very literally, heads are exploded, bodies have huge holes shot through them, and limbs fly off or simple crumble beneath the person as the .50 caliber machine gun's effect on human flesh is depicted in gross, yet accurate detail, as not only Rambo wreaks hell on the machine gun, but the sniper unloads, and the mercenaries escape and start killing with bare fists, rocks, grenades, and AK47s.<br /><br />Eventually the Karin Rebels show up, showering the Burmese with mortars and guns, and the battle winds down with a Burmese attack boat going up in flames, followed by the main bad-guy general being quickly disemboweled by Rambo as he tries to escape.<br /><br />And so with this action sequence, Stallone entertains and teaches, with gore that is excessive and yet surgical, going well overboard by comparison to its older features, and yet perfectly fitting the tone and context of the film.  Its message is clear; the situation in Burma cannot be diplomatically resolved---it must be resolved with war, against the military regime.  Even Michael, who at first whined about violence, and even yelled at Rambo for killing the pirates who threatened to rape Sarah and kill them all, ends up pouncing on a Burmese soldier, and beating him to death with a large rock.<br /><br />My only major complaint about this final action sequence was that seemingly overwhelmingly Burmese-military-death based, as only about two or three of the mercenaries died, and very few Karin Rebels were shown being hit by military fire.<br /><br />John Rambo was a man in utter denial.  He went to Vietnam and died.  He was trained to be the absolute best of fighting men, and when he returned, he returned to rejection by his society, and near death as he put his military training to test in "First Blood".  Since his many adventures, he has tried to bury his past, and end his violent lifestyle, hiding away from the rest of the world in the backwater jungles of Thailand.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, in a scene reminiscent of the opening scene of "First Blood", he is back in America, arriving on his father's farm, and seeking out the very last link to his former life, as he had in "First Blood" seeking out the last comrade in his unit.  By the end of it, Rambo has clearly come to terms with the fact he stated himself mid-way through the film:<br /><br />"War is in your blood"</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This movie delivers everything you would expect from the Rambo series, a full out guys movie. The story is surprisingly edge-of-your-seat storyline with great special effects with Stallone looking as great as the character as he ever has. Believe me, he is awesome! If you are a fan of the Rambo series, then there is no disappoinment to be found in this movie. It has some very detailed scenes that are almost so realistic it's scary. People watching this movie will stop and realize how good they have it in their lives after watching this movie. I wouldn't want to be put in anybody's shoes in those villages under attack. Great movie, definitely worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>If you are looking for Sylvester Stallone at his best, then don't miss Rambo. At his age of 60 he does the character in  all of its action packed glory! I am in total agreement with the other people who have received five stars for the comments on the movie.Rambo goes after the mercenaries in his own way. Raw, powerful and plenty of blood. It's the movie that may not be for everyone with its brutal scenes but Sylvester Stallone rules again! RAMBO ROCKS!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>"First Blood" remains one of my favorite films of all time, so when I saw this coming up I was both excited and apprehensive. After the catastrophe that was "Rambo 3", I didn't have high hopes for this. I was wrong.<br /><br />While this can't be called "high cultural entertainment", it's a fun movie. If you thought the body count of "Rambo 3" was over the top, you've got some surprises coming. I believe, by last count, he kills the entire population of Burma...twice. And no one dies with a simple "bang", but must explode in a gush of blood and guts everywhere. The movie is way way waaaaaaaay overboard with deaths, but Stallone manages to keep Rambo true to the character we've seen in the previous films.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the final scene in the film. It allowed Rambo to come full circle through it all. Contrast this final scene with the first scene of "First Blood" and you'll really be impressed. The wandering is over, so to speak. I'd really love to see another installment of the Rambo franchise, but I doubt this will ever happen. As it stands, this is a nice way to send our hero off into the sunset.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>i was really surprised . between the stock news reel footage , the engaging story and characters and the graphic brutality depicted onscreen , i was really pleased and gratified with RAMBO . stallone did an excellent job . i enjoyed his last ROCKY picture almost as much .

Sylvester Stallone's return as John Rambo is not only a good movie but a movie that has become a rallying cry to a group of actually fighting tyrany.<br /><br />We find our hero settled in Thailand, working with and catching snakes.  He is approached by a group from a church wanting to bring in a group of doctors into Burma.  Rambo declines warning them of the danger but the persistence of Sarah (Julie Benz) of religious convinces them to go.  A dangerous run-in fails to deter them and Rambo leaves them in a village where they start tending to the people's needs.<br /><br />To nobody's surprise a short time later the leader of the parish approaches him.  They haven't gotten out and haven't been heard from so he hires Rambo to bring in a group a mercs to the spot where he dropped them.<br /><br />The use of these characters really makes a difference in the movie, Rambo doesn't have to carry all the load (he is the "boat guy") and the interplay between the various guys really works well.  There is not a bad performance in the lot.<br /><br />The special features concerning the making of the movie really adds value, particularly the story of the actual repression in Burma.  The chief villain of the picture is an actual refugee from the war which is as bad as the picture describes it.  The only objection I have to the entire disk are the deleted scenes.  I think they all should have been included they would have really added to the story.<br /><br />The Military Junta is so upset over this picture that the sale of this movie is punishable by death and the possession can get you 10 years.  The rebels have taken the picture's catch phrase as their own.<br /><br />It's very rare that a picture has this kind of impact in the real world.  even if the movie wasn't as good as it was, it should be celebrated for that.<br /><br />This picture is worth your money and when the history of the fallen dictatorship is written, this picture will be a part of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>After watching the latest instalment of the Rambo series - which is very good stuff indeed in its uniquely brutal, bleak, carnage-obsessed way - I have decided that we need to airdrop Sylvester Stallone into Zimbabwe with a photo of Robert Mugabe and a .50 calibre heavy machine gun. Yes, I really do like the 'Rambo' films. This is not some ironic, "weren't the eighties great" nostalgia of the type you're seeing pimped all over mainstream broadcast media at the minute. They're great action films with some of the best musical scoring of the last thirty years which were massively influential, and, if we're honest, the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>  is 'the' populist mainstream film that really brought the debate concerning the shameful treatment of returning Vietnam veterans into the public consciousness. I'll take them over the likes of 'The Matrix' et al any day of the week. I also don't buy into the "they were Reaganite propaganda" argument. While they may have been a favourite of Teflon Ron's during the eighties, it doesn't hold water if you watch them. True, the Soviets are the enemy 'du jour' in parts two and three, but its hardly as if the American political administration comes across as any better in either of the films. Watch the opening sequences of 'First Blood' again and tell me that Brian Dennehy's agent provocateur sheriff with his "we don't want long-haired drifters in our town" wouldn't have been a dyed in the wool Republican; watch the closing soliloquy in the police station and tell me that it is in any way pro-war. Then watch the latest instalment of the series and tell me that any jingoistic war-monger of a president could use it as a military recruiting tool.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Count me among the non-believers who forever delayed seeing the botoxed muscle-bound Stallone when this fourth installment was released. Used to be the corner of his mouth that would exhibit an oddity all of its own, now it's his entire face. Thankfully, this crackerjack explosive thriller requires much of neither. It takes a clearcut plot but throws in some simmering action that is not only updated for the times (think Bourne Identity's Aikido-style stylization), it is also hardboiled enough to make the lily-livered cringe.<br /><br />There's a healthy dose of intelligence in the manner in which our beloved moose blows up entire armies of people using chickenwire, a bow and arrows, and of course his bandanna. Plus, would you believe it, you might also feel an emotion or two because, you know, evil is repugnant and evil is precisely what many of the munchkins in a nondescript Asian island (okay, Burma) happen to be: fresh cardboard variety.<br /><br />A very worthy rental if you know what to expect from a Rambo movie. You'll get it in spades. Literally.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>If you are a fan of action movies, then you can't go wrong with this movie.  John Rambo living in Thailand since the end of Rambo III has managed to survive without trouble.  But after Christian missionaries convince him to drop them off in war torn Burma so they can help the oppressed locals, things change.  The missionaries are captured and John has to get them out.  Stallone holds up well despite his age, he still manages to convey a real sense of power from the character.  He doesn't have to learn many lines, since Rambo has very little speaking parts in the movie.  The action is very violent and gory--certainly a hard R rating.  The film is very realistic in what high caliber rounds and explosives will do to a human body.  There are more limbs flying and head explosions than I have ever seen in any movie.  Though the movie is 90 minutes long, it seems shorter.  There aren't any side sub plots, there is just a little set up and tons of action.  I also liked the ending, it seemed to close things out better than Rambo III did for the character.  Much the same way Rocky Balboa closed out that series better than Rocky IV.  Excellent Blu-ray picture and sound.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>This is a GREAT action movie and a thoroughly awesome example of a Blu-Ray presentation. The technical aspects of the battle scenes rival those in 'Saving Private Ryan' -- and, perhaps, even raise the bar. And who better to turn Rambo loose upon than those creeps running the military dictatorship in Myanmar (Burma). No one deserves a giant-size can of whoop-a$$ opened up on them more than these thugs!<br /><br />I was so glad that, after loving the first 'Rambo' movie (First Blood), and being wholly disappointed with #s 2&3, that 'Rambo' is back...way back...to the wall...HOME RUN! Right on, bubba!</p></br><a href="../users/A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9.html">A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9</a><br/><p>John Rambo is back -- and so, more importantly, is Sylvester Stallone, the artist and filmmaker. With RAMBO and last year's triumphant ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone has reclaimed the respect and admiration accorded him early in his career, when his performance as a down-on-his-luck prize fighter from Philadelphia inspired comparisons to Brando and his attendant screenplay was praised for its gritty realism and fragile romanticism. There is plenty of the former and precious little of the latter in the brutal landscape Stallone has committed to celluloid with RAMBO, but that's as it should be; this isn't a live-action cartoon -- it's a nasty, grim, and uncompromising portrait of the savagery of war.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what all this means is that while RAMBO represents a new peak for the series, the sheer volume and disturbing realism of the carnage onscreen is wearing and anyone expecting the bombastic "fun" of previous installments is missing the point. Even with a relatively compact running time of just over ninety minutes, the relentless fatalism espoused by the haunted Vietnam vet makes RAMBO seem like a much longer movie. That's not a criticism -- if anything, it's a reflection of just how thoroughly Stallone has come to inhabit this character, for we feel the weight of Rambo's world-weariness in each and every frame.<br /><br />On a final note, kudos to Stallone for resisting the temptation to "water down" his vision of RAMBO to secure a PG rating; John Rambo and Sylvester Stallone are back, integrity intact.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>I was impresses.... After Rocky Balboa,a  movie almost mellow, then Sly produces Rambo IV, one of the most violent movies EVER! Heads split open all the time, knives are plunged into bodies all the time... and the plot begin with a humanitarian mission... Pretty blunt irony...<br /><br />Well, at least this was made the old way: almost no blue or over the top CGI...<br /><br />I just wonder what David Morrell thinks about Sly anda Hollywood did to John Rambo (other than being happy for getiting more dollars from his creation).</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Fans of the original three should definitley catch this one, you will probably be best off to just buy it at once. I haven't felt this visceral since the first movie, it's that impressive and Sly looks great at Sixty. Once again John Rambo is fighting injustice, this time in Myanmar (previously Burma). Apparently since we last saw Rambo he has spent years in Thailand and Myanmar catching snakes and miscellaneous other jobs to get by. When Rambo takes a church group up river to give medical aid and Christian teaching to people suffering the religious cleansing he feels they won't make a difference and he leaves. The village and the group is later ambushed by soldiers. Most the village is killed but several in the Church group survive. Rambo finds out and feels he must return to rescue them.<br /><br />The problem is a mercenary group has been sent in to extract them and they don't want Rambo's company past the point on the river he dropped off the Church group. Once again John won't take no for an answer and after he polishes off a few enemies with his trusty bow they are happy to have him. John proceeds to blow enemy soldiers up with Claymores and anything else he can get his hands on. When he gets his hands on a .50 caliber machine gun he cuts them to pieces literally. The effects and stunt people did a masterful job of making it look realistic. So be prepared for some major carnage that shouldn't be seen by younger viewers. One slight complaint is I would have liked it a little longer to develop the characters just slightly more, not to mention I didn't want it to end so quickly. I still think the first movie is the best in the series because of the story and characters, but this one is probably second because of how well it shows real events with realistic effects. Good quality DVD with reasonable replayability. If you enjoyed this catch the other "Rambo" movies or "Ruckus" for a lighter take on this story that came out pre-Rambo First Blood. - C. Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>"Rambo" (2008) makes Sam Peckinpah look like Walt Disney. This Sylvester Stallone bloodfest exists in its own cinematic universe - functioning as a graphic journey into Burmese carnage. At least Stallone keeps things moving while bullets, bombs and bodies fly in all directions. The 90-minute running time adds to the B-movie atmosphere. Thanks for the memories, Sly, but enough already.</p></br></body></html>

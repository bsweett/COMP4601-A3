The two twin Autobots were stupid, so was the stupid roomate of Sam's. No need for them at all. They tried to make it too funny, I think, and I think they failed at it. The action is good and the story is decent, but overall it's really only a decent movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Like the first one, this second transformer movie can be enjoyed but dont expect<br />too much.  It might be exciting for a 8 year old, but after a while the continous<br />transformations will put you to sleep due to lack of good substance called acting<br />and story.  I hear they want to make a 3rd movie, they should consider the following:<br />  1. Dump Meagan Fox....or get her to act...not just a pretty shinny face.<br />  2. Hire better writters.<br />  3. Stop making the parents that dumb... its kind of embarassing.</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>But I had to turn this thing down. The power sound is in the action and dialogue is lower. Keep your remote near.<br />You were expecting Macbeth from Bruckeimer?<br />but the WalMart copy...<br />The IMAX scenes are fantastic. Transitions are smooth and the impact is great! Looking at the 'Forest Scene ' and the "Pyramid Scene' and I was pleased to have the WalMart copy. It's a gimmicky film and the additional Visual Punch is welcome!<br />They should have made this available to everybody!<br />Again; the sound may draw the Law!</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>I do not intend to get into details about if the movie is good or bad. It is a movie based on a cartoon that was most of the times cheesier than the two existing live action movies about giant transforming robots from another planet. Need I say more? I'll focus then on the Bluray edition and its contents as there are already plenty of reviews discussing the quality of the film.<br /><br />Disc one includes the movie with an audio commentary by director Michael Bay and the writers. The movie looks and sounds incredible in its Bluray edition, the level of detail (1080p) on the scenery, the characters, the robots (while transforming for example) and the sounds during the battles make perfect reference material for HD home theater display, a 5.1 DTS-HD master audio track is included, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital are also presented. There is however, an exclusive edition which includes the IMAX scenes in shifting aspect ratio, this is not the version Amazon is selling in case that's the version you are after.<br /><br />Disc two is loaded with plenty of extra material in full HD:<br />* The Human Factor (Exacting Revenge of the Fallen) - Includes documentaries covering the whole process from Development and design to post-production and release of the film, you can watch them separately or as a whole.<br />* A Day with Bay: Tokyo - If you followed the release of the film in theaters you may remember the world premiere took place in Tokyo; this documentary includes all the details on the premiere, from Bay's impressions on 'Terminator Salvation', to the press conferences and the like. While in HD most of the time there are some night shots that do not look that well.<br />* 25 Years of Transformers - This is a documentary on the history of the Transformers franchise.<br />* Deleted/Alternate Scenes - Only three are included and they are actually extended scenes that you can easily tell why they were removed ("Sam and Alice meet", "Witwickys in Paris"  and "Leo refuses to go to Egypt")<br />* Linkin Park's "New Divide" Music Video<br />*The Matrix of Marketing - Includes trailers, TV spots and image galleries of posters and merchandise.<br /><br />While I prefer the first movie over this one, 'Revenge of the fallen" does not disappoint in its Bluray edition. Another Michael Bay popcorn film filled with explosions, great cars and giant transforming robots. If you, like me, get this movie just for the fun and do not expect Criterion Collection material, you are in for a treat.<br /><br />One last note for those collectors interested in slipcovers, Amazon's edition comes in a pretty cool Optimus Prime one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Continuing where Transformers left off, the Autobots are valiantly defending Earth from the pesky Decepticons. Along the way, thousands of innocent civilians are killed, but who cares, the Decepticons always lose at the end of the day right? That is until new ones are created, or brought back to life by other pesky Decepticons from outer space. It is then where College Freshman Shia Laboef (I hate spelling his, or his character's last name) must then help save humanity, with the help of familiar friends and Meagan Fox, who filmmakers could find no better reason to be in this film other than cheesy emotional scenes and eye candy.<br /><br />I must admit, this film is impossible for a real movie reviewer, or critics to review because their job title has them breaking down movies to see if you should enjoy them. Unfortunately, if you break this film down, it loses all it's fun. So don't think, just sit and enjoy.<br /><br />See It If:<br /><br />You like Awesome action: This is almost a pure action movie, because the fighting sequences are stunning, and really make you get into the movie despite any flaws it may have. Sure, a 20-minute action sequence may be overblown, but I was enjoying every moment of it.<br /><br />You like comedy that is funny in the moment: To balance the intense action, the writers upped the quotient on comedy this time around, having several LOL jokes that kept a semi-permanent smile on my face throughout the film, especially in the college scenes. Kudos especially to Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson who play Shia's parents and teacher, respectively. I could have done without the juvenile scenes of dogs humping which a 6-year old sitting a few seats down from me found particularly enjoyable. However, don't think about these jokes later, because you mind lose your mind trying to wrap it around these jokes.<br /><br />Don't See It If:<br /><br />Your movies are driven on plot: This plot is one in the moment as you get it when it's happening, but you're left wondering later how the heck they got there. Again, don't think, just sit and enjoy.<br /><br />Your tolerance for pure stupidity is low: Yeah, this has been beaten to death by other reviewers. You have been warned.<br /><br />You hated the Transformers mythology: Because if you got confused before, you're going to be scratching your head here. It's like they went for the geeks, and left the rest of us just to ignore that aspect, because it gets confusing.<br /><br />Now For Some Observations:<br /><br />This movie is very grounded in 2009... Swine Flu jokes? Economy jokes? And a Chevy Volt? Will anybody get what any of this means in 10 years?<br /><br />Speaking of which, from the first scenes GM makes their presence known because they must have gotten a HUGE contract with the government.<br /><br />Obama is anti-Transformer! He's mentioned specifically by name in the movie as wanting to shut down the Transformers program as he feels they could be a threat to nation's security. I mean, he is pro immigration! His National Security advisor is also a jerk within the movie, so it shows poor judgement in his staff choices... Republicans, ravage at this fact, Democrats steer clear of these scenes.<br /><br />Did the composer get lazy in this movie? I counted no less than 4 times Linkin Park's "New Divide" was played in the movie either instrumentally or in full. Same goes for Green Day's "21 Guns" which I counted no less than 5 times during the movie. It also happened to be the ONLY song playing in Meagan Fox's garage.<br /><br />Again, a LOT of civilians die in this movie. In the first I was shocked when a Decepticon plowed through a bus, but in this movie, that's nothing. Buildings are wiped out, cars are smashed at will, aircraft carriers are blown up with no survivors. It's almost numbing after a while.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />In a survey of viewers that saw the movie, 91% said it was as good, if not better than the first. I would join these people in saying that what the first one sets up, the sequel takes and runs away with in explosive fashion. And despite its many flaws, I was fully-engrossed in the movie, and you will be too if you don't try to break it down, or take it too seriously. But I must admit I have seen this movie 4 or 5 times now, and it grates on me more every time I see it, so keep repeat viewing at an absolute minimum. Keep your unbridled joy of watching the first time in your memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">The first movie</a> I enjoyed a lot.  Sure, it was silly and cheesy, but within the movie's concept of "logic," it was both forgiveable and fun.  It was exactly what I expected it to be, no more and no less.<br /><br />This film was much, much less.  So much less that even the spectacular fight scenes grew tiresome and monotonous.<br /><br />Here's the skinny:<br /><br />The plot is breath-takingly idiotic.  Sam's home is beseiged by a dozen or so tiny (and seemingly spontaneous) Decepticon bots right before he leaves for college.  Bumblebee jumps in and (chaotically) saves the day.  Moments later, Sam tells Bumblebee that he isn't taking the Autobot with him to college for reasons that make no sense whatsoever.  Add to this an annoying and absurd subplot about Sam having difficulty saying the "love" word to his uber-perfect girlfriend.<br /><br />About that girlfriend: scriptwriters, please give your characters flaws.  Megan Fox's character is perfect in every conceivable way, from her patience with Sam to the sultry way she bends over engines as she fixes them.  She and Sam have endured life-changing (and -threatening) situations together, and yet, Sam still can't bring himself to tell her how much she means to him.  As soon as the couple begins arguing about the "L" word, you know immediately what the climax of the film will entail.<br /><br />The Earth has also been beset with an unusually high number of violent and high-profile Decepticon attacks.  In the face of this, what does the American government do?  In the greatest plot contrivance of all, a liason from the president not only kicks the Autobots off the planet, he does so with a speech that conveniently (for the audience and the Decepticon) lays out every weakness and detail of the country's experience with the Transformers.<br /><br />These are just a few of the film's gaping holes.  In order to distract from these, the creators added the following window dressing, ostensibly to titillate and amuse:<br /><br />--a pointless scene involving Sam's mom and some illegal brownies<br /><br />--two jive-talking robots with golden buck teeth and huge ears; when these characters first appeared, I turned to a friend who had come with me to the IMAX and said, "Is it just me, or are those things racist?"  My friend held up his forefinger and thumb and said, "Yeah.  Just a bit."<br /><br />--a new kind of Decepticon that stretches credulity; let's just say it can shift into some really hot shapes<br /><br />--the robots are given more human characteristics than ever before, including breath, farts, and anatomically correct groins<br /><br />Other things I couldn't help but notice:<br /><br />--it takes the Decepticons roughly five minutes to break into and take over a top-secret, ultra-secure military compound, but they have an extraordinary amount of difficulty stealing a purse from an 18 year old girl on a motorbike<br /><br />--Sam's dormroom is so full of gorgeous coeds that they actually have a character explain the abnormal ratio of hot chicks<br /><br />--Rainn Wilson is under-utilized as a smarmy professor in a classroom scene that contributes almost nothing to the plot<br /><br />--a military official, when he receives an anonymous transmission from a character telling him to fire the government's most dangerous, most top secret weapon at one of the three pyramids in Egypt only hesitates about half a second before going ahead and doing it<br /><br />--Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox have absolutely no chemistry this time around; it took me about five minutes to realize that they were flirting when they started talking about breaking up.<br /><br />See it for the fight scenes, I guess, but try not to think too hard.  Or at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Action, Adventure and War. I'm a big Transformer fan. It's amazing and the humor is awesome.

Reprising their roles from the first film, I found myself having to sit through a soap opera of Sam Witwicky's parents crying over their son leaving for college - at least until their kitchen utensils come to life!<br /><br />Then we have Sam unable to say I love you to his air-headed, hot girlfriend, played vacuously by Megan Fox.  She looks great but hardly has any lines.  One of the robots said it well when he said she looks hot but is not that smart.<br /><br />The little transformer truck robot is spying to the Decepticons.  It's obviously running around in her garage and no one notices?  The Autobots' rendition of slum kids with the Black ghetto accents will probably offend some viewers.<br /><br />Besides the dropped "coming of age" storyline with the ridiculous antics of Sam's roommate and screaming girlfriend who just wants to have her first online date, we have a decent bit of history of the Optimus Prime's group, who deal with the red-tape of government - run by a lackey who gets his quite nicely I might add.<br /><br />Action:  The movie forgets about a decent script and plot for some Rockem Sockem action with lots of alien robot fights.  Yes, lots of explosions - well, it is a Michael Bay film after all.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Outside of learning about the invasion of these `Bots and how they've been around us since the dawn of Time, and some incredibly impossible athletic actions by Sam, who almost dies in the attempt upon the deserts of Egypt, it's really not much of a film.  The first film was much better.<br /><br />Rental.<br /><br />Suggest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060FXBNM">Transformers Trilogy (Transformers / Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen / Transformers: Dark of the Moon) [Blu-ray</a>]</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>After the events of the first Transformers movie, Sam Spike Witwicky (Shia Lebeouf) has graduated high school and now becoming a college student. Bumblebee is left behind but does still follow Sam even in disguise as his friends such as Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen) with Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth) and Ironhide (Voiced by Jess Harnell) plus other new autobots like Skids (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Mudflap, Arcee and others have had their battle with the Decepticons especially Starscream (Voiced by Charles Adler). Sam however has one of the last remaining pieces of the all-spark then something goes haywire went it's powers go into his brain making him a bit smarter, more frantic and fast paced like never before like if he had a rush of some kind especially writing weird transformers type languages on paper and some kind of supernatural ability. An ancient Decepticon named "The Fallen" (Voiced by Tony Todd) has arrived on Earth seeking revenge but while he's at it, Sam has became a target for Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving) and other decepticons must seek an ancient device hidden in Egypt that can unleash doom into the world.<br /><br />Co-starring Megan Fox back as Mikaela, Isobel Lucas, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel this is a very entertaining and well paced sequel that is actually four stars. Sure some of the jokes are crude yet tasteless and weak at times including former Decepticon Jetfire (Voiced by Mark Jones) being one of those old-man jokes to even humping stuff but there is a few good hilarious moments. The acting is quite good, the action sequences are breathtaking as usual from Michael Bay as they are better than the first and amazing CGI even thought "Avatar" has the best visual effects of 2009. We get more Transformers such as Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Soundwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), and Skipjack (Voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) and sometimes it's a bit racist with those 2 robots being punk-hip hop stereotypes even goofy looking but annoying at times. What more can you want when you can turn off your brain and have some fun despite what lousy critics said.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray Wal Mart edition is PHENOMENAL with amazing big screen IMAX style picture and flawless sound quality like never. The extras are fantastic such as commentary, documentary called Human Factor which takes you behind the scenes, Destructing Visual Bayhem which gives you multi-angel sequences, NEST: Transformer Data Hub which tells you files of Transformers in quality 3D including history, The Blu-Ray exclusive called Allspark Experiment, 25 years of transformers featurette, deleted and alternate scenes, giant effing movie which is a semi behind the scenes montage, music video by Linkin Park and of course Trailers, TV Spots and galleries.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>The thing is a mess. Sure the action is still killer, no filler. The problem is the 1st Transformers was done with a wink-in-the-eye sense of humor. This one has almost zero humor in it and any attempts at it are lame. I just didn't get why they had two jive talkin' transformers. Is this the 1970s?<br /><br />The whole premise seems flimsy. The US has some heavily secured facilities yet they are so easy to break into despite the fact they now know the evil Transformer decepticon robots exist. Then deaths here are cartoonish (OK, the series comes from a cartoon but it's still dumb).<br /><br />Also, explain to me how the mom and dad end up in Egypt. I still don't get how in the middle of some massive battle they just pop up when we last saw them maybe an hour ago in Paris.<br /><br />Also, the thing they are chasing or whatever is called the "matrix." Wow, how original! Name it after another hit sci-fi movie. Maybe it's all part of the comic book/cartoon series but I had to laugh at that. Also, laughable is this super evil decepticon is called "the Fallen." Really? That's the coolest name you could come up with with religious overtones?<br /><br />When you read the title, I expected "the Fallen" to stand for a group of decepticons. Nope. It stands for the big cheese decepticon. Dumb.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not like this movie is bad for what it is, it's just not as mindblowing as the 1st one.<br /><br />This DVD has zero extras, by the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>while i gave the first movie perfect marks for sheer entertainment,this sequel is actually a more complete film,in my opinion,as much as this type of movie can be.for one,the story is actually much more interesting and more developed.the humour quotient is upped in this one as well.there are quite a few chuckles.some of the transformers are really neat,especially on the Decepticon side.the fight scenes between the Transformers are quite spectacular,though that isn't surprising.what is surprising is that the transformation scenes(when the vehicles change into their robot forms and vice versa were not seamless,and looked herky jerky to me.in the original film,this was not an issue.still,it's immensely entertaining.and despite a few minor issue.a better movie overall.as an aside,the movie is nominated for a Razzie Award for worst movie,which mystifies me.it's nowhere near Razzie calibre.oh,well.for me,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a 5/5</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>The Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen blu-ray is nothing short of spectacular. The picture and sound are top notch. I was one of those kids who grew up watching Transformers and playing with all the cool transformer toys. I was thrilled when the first live Transformers movie came out a few years back. I was just as excited to see the new Transformers Revenge of The Fallen movie, but was a little worried after reading some pretty bad reviews. I don't know whats up with all the haters and critics who hate this movie. Oh well, all that matters is that I enjoyed it, and many Transformers fans will enjoy it as well. After seeing the new Transformers movie I can say the critics are wrong, this movie was awesome! The entire original cast is back which plays a huge part of this movies success. The movie takes off where the last one left off. Starscream (now the leader of the Decepticons) decides to return to earth from Cybertron to revive the Decepticon leader Megatron. After the Autobots discover Megatron has been revived and is now seeking revenge, Optimus Prime tries to get Sam to help them stop Megatron once and for all. This new movie is even more action packed than the first, and if you're a fan of Transformers you will most likely love this new movie. This is now one of the best looking blu-rays to date. The Walmart edition is similar to the IMAX Dark Knight edition, with a few fight scenes that fill up your entire TV, but other than that there's not much difference. There is no doubt that this will be the one of if not the biggest selling blu-ray to date. With the new PS3 slim and top notch release like this, I believe this is the movie to finally take blu-ray to the mainstream.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the Blu-ray will include an exclusive interactive feature that gives viewers the ability to customize their own robot characters and get a glimpse at a rogue robot. Out of all the available permutations, one will unlock an exclusive interview with Michael Bay about his plans for the next adventure.<br /><br />Two-Disc Special Edition DVD & Blu-ray:<br /><br />The TRANSFORMERS: Revenge of the Fallen specs below<br /><br />The Blu-ray is presented in 1080p high definition with English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles.

You get more transforming robots, but no character(s) you can relate to. There are lots of actions and battles between the good and evil, but you just can't tell which is which, watching the hectic movements of the CG-created transformers that would make you dizzy.<br /><br />The fierce fight with the Decepticon forces continues in "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen." This time the evil robots are planning something much more damaging to the Earth, and humans and autobots, or good robots, must stop them before it is too late. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox reprise their roles as Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes. Sam is going to college, leaving his gorgeous girlfriend in his hometown, but soon Sam learns that he has accidentally got a secret that the evil Decepticon leader really needs.<br /><br />Well, this is only the introduction. "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" runs about 150 minutes and the story defies easy summary simply because the story is actually non-existent. Like the two "Pirates of the Caribbean" sequels, the film takes up the story that should have ended in the original. Instead, the filmmakers have added new characters (humans and transformers), new locations and long, extended action sequences that are bigger and louder than before.<br /><br />Actually, this is not a bad thing. After all Michael Bay films (such as "Pearl Harbor" "Armageddon" "The Rock" and two "Bad Boys") have been known for actions and most of us are aware of that. To his credit, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" provides tons of actions with first-rate visual effects though I prefer less shaky camerawork.<br /><br />Sadly Michael Bay (and producer Steven Spielberg) has forgotten one important thing. Transformers are characters with their own personalities, not just machines. In the original "Transformer" the director tried to present them as characters and succeeded to some extent, in some of the scenes like comical interaction between Bumblebee (as a Camaro) and a human friend, Sam. In fact Shia LaBeouf's Sam was a pretty interesting character in the first "Transformer," but here he just sleepwalks or overacts.<br /><br />In the sequel two new smaller Autobots appear as comic relief, but they sound more like two Jar Jar Binks. More irritating is Sam's parents, especially his mom, who goes berserk in the campus. Michael Bay (and Spielberg) was never good at doing comedy and he overreaches himself when he tries to make us laugh.<br /><br />Still the film's actions and visuals are amazing and for that alone, my 2.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 5:28 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Team Haunted Flower reviews Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. We love to watch robots fight each other and lots of explosions in our summer movies, who could blame us? Yes, there are gaping plot holes, but there were a few improvements made from the first one so don't know a popcorn flick too hard. Here are my thoughts and complaints.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>I like to really voice my opinon when it comes to movies I see and plan to own on dvd. The first Transformers film I had a great case to show that it was a good movie. Now we have the sequeal. Same director, same actors and a few new robots.<br /><br />Let me be as consice as I can. If you want to see a movie with a great plot, oscar worthy performaces and an ending that will make you leap out of your seat an applaud. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! PUT A RESTRAINING ORDER ON IT IF YOU HAVE TO! Here is the honest truth about 'Revenge of the Fallen' The acting is the worst I have seen since 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'. I use this movie by comparison for good reason. My intentions for seeing 'Revenge of the Sith' or any of the 3 recent installmets to the Star Wars franchise had nothing to do with the expectations of seeing a movie that was perfect with no equal. No, I just wanted to see a Star Wars movie and get closure I wanted seeing Anakin Skywalker finally become Darth Vader. By the way if you are a reader that had no idea that THAT was the outcome of Star Wars then I should personally slap you around for a bit before you climbed back under the stone you crawled out from for at least 20 years of your life. Now that I have gone completly off topic I will get back to my review. The real reason I wanted to see this highly anticipated Transformers sequel was to see sweet looking plains trains and automobiles turn in to awesome kick keister robots and signature Michael Bay explosions! Also while the plot is about as shallow as the local kiddie pool a true fan of the Transformers cartoon will get a real treat of plot devices from the orgional show. The movie is loud, fun and ficken awesome. Apparently the movie did it's job at the box office because they have green lit the third installment. So, a hit for Mr. Bay, LESS ACTING AND MORE ROBOTS PLEASE!</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Ok, some of you are wondering why I gave this 5 stars and I will explain. Let's discuss the story. Sam (LaBeouf) is ready to go to college and be a normal guy. It all goes to hell in a handbasket as the Decepticons steal a fragment of the All Spark and revive Megatron! The Autobots ask for Sam's help, who declines. Soon enough, Sam is in trouble as Megatron tries to capture him because he holds the map to where the Matrix of Leadership is kept. During his rescue, Optimus is destroyed and the Autobots are asked to leave the planet by the government. Sam, now feeling responsible goes on a quest to find the Matrix to revive Optimus and learns that they Transformers have been on Earth for millions of years, led by the Fallen. It is this Decepticon that wants the Matrix to destroy the sun and take it's energy for himself!<br /><br />So now, there is way too much camp and comedy. The story lacks continuity. Megan Fox is hot but can't act. Shia is charmingly annoying. Who is the idiot that plays Leo? Skids and Mudflap....oops? Here is why I give it 5 stars! The Transformers themselves! They are the movie! Frank Welker from the cartoon voices Soundwave. Jetfire! There are more Autobots and Decepticons to enjoy! But the real reason for 5 stars....OPTIMUS PRIME!!! For the first time fans get what they've always wanted, Optimus unleashed. He is a force in this movie and basically kicks a$$ and takes names later! For these reasons, I forget everything else. No one will ever confuse Transformers for Casablanca! That's not what these movies are about! Way go Bay and co.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Excellent picture and audio. The picture is so beautiful, which really brings the CGI characters to life. This is a DEMO DISC! SPECIAL FEATURES: All are carried over plus BD extras. FINAL THOUGHTS: UPGRADE!!! A MUST OWN!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This movie transforms eye candy to a new level. This movie is not only funny at points, it is loaded with tons of special effects and action. While there have been some extensive negative reviews, I recommend that you still see it for yourself.<br /><br />What I find to be a big plus in this film is that they did not cover under the darkness of night the climax of the action sequences (like in Iron Man 2 that hid  its climax at night). The animators are simply brilliant and are capable of creating their wares in the full view of the sun. This is a bold step that must be appreciated.<br /><br />The visuals are crisp and the 'transformations' are electrifying. This is an action film, so there is no mind bending plot here. It is just a lot of bigger than life action sequences, one after the other. There are no dull moments in this film, you if you have to get something, put this film on pause!</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>Michael Bay's summer blockbuster is sure to be a colossal hit with its intended audience.  Plus the previews looked pretty spectacular.  But, great special effects hardly compensate for mediocre action sequences and inept storytelling.  This mega-budget clunker has too many moronic nuts and bolts to ever be considered much of a smooth thrill ride.<br /><br />I did like this slightly more than the original, but that's not saying much.  The plot here is pretty stagnant and unimaginative, but I wasn't expecting anything close to THE DARK KNIGHT.  But for some reason this weak story gets stretched to 2.5 hours, and it gets extremely tedious.<br /><br />There are some decent fight scenes, and the Decepticons do seem pretty formidable.  Partially this film seemed geared towards a family film, as there are no human casualties in battle.  But then for some reason they threw in plenty of unneccessary profanity just for some cheap laughs.  And some drug use?  Hardly meant for the younger crowd.<br />Plus some other attempts at humor fall pretty flat.<br /><br />Another Big problem:<br />Shia Lebouf--the dork<br />Megan Fox--the goddess<br />Bumblebee--the awesomest car/robot ever created<br />The result--Lebarf leaves them for college and makes out with the first chick he meets?  Plus Megan catches him and quickly forgives him?<br />Shamefully retarded!!!!!!!<br /><br />Overall, the cool robots, good CGI & music, plus one gorgeous babe can't carry this movie for very long.  It's nearly impossible to fathom how such a big budget action flick could be so painfully boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Michael Bay, what went wrong?<br /><br />"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" suffers from sequelitis big time. It almost seems as though Bay decided that whatever worked in the first "Transformers" film had to be bigger, louder, more frantic, more hectic and less human in this new sequel. And more of it. A lot more.<br /><br />The first "Transformers" was a surprising film. Infused with a significant amount of character and story, the film used newfound star Shia LaBeouf and made him the center of the film. Because he was so good, the loud, frantic whirling special effects seemed better somehow. They made sense. And the relationship between LaBeouf's character and Megan Fox's character seemed sweet somehow, something we can all relate to. Bay layered in the usual special effects, allowing him to play with his toy box, but they actually contributed to the story and were cool to watch.<br /><br />All of this helped the first "Transformers" become a huge hit. When a sequel became inevitable, Bay apparently decided to just add more and more and more to the new film. Bigger is better, right?<br /><br />But all of these additional elements only serve to make the new film everything the first film wasn't. Loud, obnoxious, confusing, repetitious and filled with two-dimensional characters.<br /><br />Picking up a few months after the first film ended, Sam (LaBeouf) is headed to college and his parents (Julie White and Kevin Dunn) are ready for a trip to Europe. Sam is distraught at the prospect of leaving Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind and they have an argument about who will say "I Love You" first. Before he leaves for school, he spots a piece of the All Spark, the object the Transformers were fighting over in the first film, causing him to see symbols everywhere. The All Spark fragment also wakes up some Transformers who soon start to attack Mikaela before she quickly subdues them. When Sam arrives at school, the symbols continue to distract him. Before you can say "Optimus Prime", we learn that a new leader of the Decepticons (or old depending on how you look at it) the Fallen has come back and taken control. He leads the Decepticons in an all out battle to find Sam and Mikaela and learn what he knows. They think the symbols will lead them to an ancient resting place for their ancestors, an ancient resting place hiding a power that will allow them to take over the Earth. Naturally, Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee and the other Transformers have something to say about that. The US Government has set up a special ops unit led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) to work with Optimus Prime and his team to hunt down Decepticons hiding across the globe. As we watch a lengthy prologue, it becomes apparent they have been around for a long time. After a destructive chase through Shanghai, a US Senator manages to convince the President to let him take over the unit. And all he wants to do is shut them down. So Lennox and Epps have to work to keep him at arms length. Eventually, as Sam and Mikaela try to figure out what the symbols mean and how to avoid the Decepticons, they run across an old friend (John Turturro) who now works in a deli. Soon, everyone is headed to Egypt.<br /><br />Does this synopsis sound as confusing to you as it does to me? And I've seen the film. This is a big part of the problem with "Fallen". There is too much going on and little of it makes sense.<br /><br />There is a lengthy prologue showing the Fallen leading a group of Decepticons to Earth and battling with cavemen. This is kind of a neat idea and helps to set up the rest of the film. I guess Bay was bored by this sequence, as it is ostensibly just narrative, because this is immediately followed by a lengthy action sequence set in Shanghai. Lennox, Epps, Optimus Prime and the other Transformers are hunting a Decepticon. When they find the bad Transformer, all hell breaks loose and they chase the renegade through the busy, crowded streets. During the chase, many buildings and a freeway are destroyed. This sequence is fun to watch, but later, you begin to wonder what role it plays in the overall film. It doesn't seem to have a lot of connection, except to introduce us to new Transformers, and to reintroduce us to the robots we have already met. More on this later. The sequence, while fun to watch, ultimately just seems like a waste of time. And when a film like this runs two hours and thirty minutes, time isn't something you want to waste. More on that later.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing about "Fallen" is the waste of the actors. No one shows any emotion and everyone seems to be simply walking through the story. We have seen this from Bay before, he has never been very interested in character development or story, preferring to make things blow up, but after the first "Transformers" film, I held out some hope that he would continue to learn and continue to improve his storytelling technique. At one point, Mikaela cries and Bay lingers his camera on her face to capture the teardrop, almost as though he is trying to prove he can capture emotion.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure "Fallen" is appropriate for young children. The first time we see Mikaela (Fox) she is literally draped across the top of a motorcycle, her butt barely covered in denim short shorts, her blousy shirt revealing a tight t-shirt inside. The composition almost seems like a parody of a Maxim cover. Apparently, she now works at a motorcycle shop detailing the top of the chassis. This apparently requires her to get real close, forcing her to lay on top of the motorcycle, the big engine between her bent legs. Later, after Sam arrives at college, another beautiful young lady, Alice (Isabel Lucas), starts to throw herself at Sam. As soon as this storyline began to play out, I could just see the filmmakers looking at her audition tape. "She is HOT". Later, when a twist occurs, the story makes some lewd references and she makes some strange gestures. Not exactly appropriate for little kids.<br /><br />I defy just about anyone to remember what most of the Transformer's names are. Beyond the few central characters (Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee, Megatron), there are simply too many of them and they don't look or act differently enough to make it easy to recognize them. Given the level of cacophony, it is near impossible to hear them address each other. So this limits the number of characters we can follow to about half the number on screen. Of those, again another half are distinct enough to make us care about them. What is the point of adding so many characters when it is all but impossible to follow them, to make any sense of them?<br /><br />Of the new additions, two seem particularly problematic. During the Shanghai sequence, we see a beaten up ice cream truck participating in the action. When the truck breaks apart into two transformers (I think), they begin talking in a highly characterized 'jive' talk. Later, these robots get an upgrade and transform into two different 'Scion' like cars. I have heard these characters referred to as Bay's Jar Jar Binks. It is a pretty good analogy. They are insulting characters and only serve to bring the quality of the rest of the film down.<br /><br />Later in the film, they meet an old British Decepticon (I'm not kidding) who served in World War II as a bomber but has now switched sides. They find him in the Smithsonian and... oh, well, do you really want to read about story points that make little or no sense?<br /><br />With the two beginning sequences and an extremely long sequence set in Egypt to close the film, "Transformers Revenge of the Fallen" seems long. As soon as the Egypt plotline began, and we begin to watch LaBeouf and Fox running through the desert sand, my companion turned to me and said "Doesn't this seem familiar?" An accurate assessment as much of the beginning of the first film concerns Lennox and Epps fighting the Decepticons in another desert. Repetition is not a good thing in film and only serves to make this film seem longer.<br /><br />Worse yet, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) is nowhere to be found which leads Bay and his writers to come up with a new villain. They look back, you might say way back, and come up with the Fallen. He resembles a cross between a transformer and Alien. This is a little ironic as Bay recently feuded with director McG over "Terminator Salvation", claiming some of his new Terminators resembled Transformers. Michael, It appears that he is not the only director to receive inspiration from others.<br /><br />"Transformers Revenge of the Fallen" is the second most disappointing film of the summer. "Terminator Salvation" is the first.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN<br /><br />STARRING: Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Ramon Rodriguez, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, Isabel Lucas, Rainn Wilson, Glenn Morshower and the voices of: Hugo Weaving, Tony Todd, Peter Cullen, Reno Wilson, Robert Foxworth and Jess Harnell<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Ehren Kruger, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Michael Bay<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 24 June 2009<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that no-one is a bigger Michael Bay fan than I am, because this is going to get ugly and I want everyone to know that he is an amazing director. He just had this one slip up and it's called Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.<br /><br />I have stood behind Bay on every one of his previous films including Armageddon and Pearl Harbor which I thought were amazing and have gotten so much criticism. Bay is notorious for putting things in his movies that would never happen in real life and when called out on it he will flat out admit to it. He likes to push the envelope of reality in order to make something look cool. But you can't blame him entirely because he knows his audience better than perhaps any director in Hollywood. You need only to look at the billions of dollars his films have grossed to see that. He knows what Middle America wants to see. Several people have told me that this movie was incredible and that they loved it and that it was better than the first one. I disagree entirely but there are so many people out there that just want to be visually entertained for two plus hours and take away nothing else from the film. I have had people tell me that they like to watch bright and shiny things go bang on the screen. If this is what you are looking for in a film, then Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is for you. Now on with the bashing.<br /><br />The film opened very weak in comparison to Transformers. Optimus Prime's voice seemed dull and not as adventurous as it did when we first met him. Maybe he had already seen the movie when they had him narrate it.<br /><br />I have heard rumors that Bay shot all of the action and CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery) sequences months before there was even a script and then had the writers generate the rest of the story around those scenes. Is it true? Not sure.<br /><br />I've got to tell you however, watching the film it looks like that's exactly what happened. And the writers are all very talented. He brought back the two who wrote the first film as well as another writer who has an incredible list of successful screenplays under his belt to include, Arlington Road and Reindeer Games just to name a few. And the two writers who wrote the first film also wrote the new Star Trek and Mission Impossible III. So you have to ask, how did this film get so horribly screwed up? Where was the witty dialogue and perfect comedic timing that the first film was engulfed with? Where was the cool story and plot and character development scenes? Who knows what happened.<br /><br />I will say that it is filled with awesome action sequences and should undoubtedly win an Oscar for best special effects and at the very least be nominated for Oscars in sound and sound effects editing. But I feel like that's all the film had to offer and I'm sorry but that's just not enough. I don't care if it's just an action movie. It's because I'm such a huge fan of Michael Bay that I'm this disappointed. Luckily he promises to put more effort into the script of the third film.<br /><br />The plot is nearly impossible to explain. It's everywhere all at once. Apparently the Transformers have been here for thousands of years and the leader of the bad guys (Decepticons), called The Fallen, was imprisoned in space. It makes you wonder if they called him The Fallen before he fell or if it's just been so long that perhaps they just forgot his real name. Anyhow, his buddies send Transformers out on missions to gather intelligence from our Military bases that apparently don't have very good security at all. They soon discover that Sam (Shia LaBeouf) has a shard of the cube left from the first film.<br /><br />We learn that Sam is off to college without his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). I am amazed that this girl even made it into Hollywood. Next to Paris Hilton, she has to be the worst actress out there. I understand that she is attractive physically and that nine out of 10 guys would love to sleep with her. So many guys tell me "She's hot dude." So what if she's hot, she's a terrible actress! This is a huge movie and there are plenty of actresses who are 'hot' and can actually act! Hopefully her character will die early in the third film.<br /><br />Sam is talking on the phone with her using very cheesy dialogue that is obviously pushing toward what is going to happen next, when a piece of the cube drops from the pocket of the sweatshirt he was wearing at his first Transformers encounter. He explains that he hasn't washed it because it's his lucky shirt, as lame as that is, thank God Shia LaBeouf is a great actor so it's tolerable. But then he drops the shard of the cube and it burns through the floor and the ceiling of the floor below and lands on a countertop and somehow can't melt through that. Then all of the metallic common household appliances come to life. They transform, so I guess we are supposed to believe that they are Transformers? But the Transformers are aliens so did the Witwickeys purchase all of their appliances from Mars? A huge firefight ensues and Sam is rescued by his Camaro that Transforms into Bumblebee.<br /><br />Immediately following this scene, Sam tells Bumblebee he's leaving him at home because he is no longer in danger. I guess Sam must have suffered amnesia to not remember that he was just attacked by several little Transformers. And what kid in their right mind would leave behind a brand new Camaro, let alone one that's a Transformer?<br /><br />Bay also shows Mikaela sitting on a motorcycle wearing the skimpiest outfit imaginable in a very provocative pose at her father's body shop. Maybe her dad was at lunch when she struck this unnatural pose? We also get to see Mikaela change her outfit to say goodbye to Sam which is really an excuse to just see her change her outfit. And then it isn't shown to us how exactly Mikaela ends up with the shard of the cube and later in the film Sam actually asks her if she has it, but she takes it with her and where does she put it? She brings it to the body shop which is comprised entirely of metal objects and not one of them turns into a Transformer, like Sam's appliances did. How does that add up?<br /><br />This film doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be. At one moment it is filled with vulgarity, intense violence sequences, it shows two male dogs having sex with each other and Sam's mom even samples pot-filled brownies at his college and has some amusing side effects. While I was not offended by any of these moments in the film, I know that several parents were.<br /><br />Then on the other hand, it is filled with all kinds of lame child-related humor as well. A lot of the Transformers are real slap-stick characters like the twins who I found to be annoying in every scene and the little voices that some of them have. A lot of the dialogue by the Transformers is child-like in nature as well. There's even a Transformer that is so old he has a beard made out of metallic shards and uses a piece of his body as a cane to get around. Come on, seriously?<br /><br />He's a great actor, but they used the same guy that played the Colonel in the first film, (Glenn Morshower) to play a Four Star General in this one. He is working with the good Transformers (Auto Bots) in a special military unit. For some reason, despite the fact he is in charge of the project, he is allowed by a Major to speak with Optimus Prime, but can't see him directly. And Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) knows way more about the project than the General. So much in fact that he doesn't feel the need to call the General, Sir when speaking to him and is aware that the President has appointed a new civilian in charge of Commanding the Auto Bots. The General actually says, "I guess I didn't get that memo." I was in the military folks and I'm here to tell you that a Major would damn sure refer to a Four Star General as Sir or General and would have no knowledge of information regarding the President and his chief of Staff that the General would not. Wow.<br /><br />Sam and Mikaela meet up with a really irritating kid who is supposed to be a comic relief that is Sam's roommate in college and the always funny and enjoyable John Turturro's character Simmons. They all set out to gain information from the very old Transformer mentioned previously. They are then transported by him miraculously to the pyramids in Egypt where the secret to their salvation is believed to be and the third act takes place. I glanced at the clock on my DVD player when watching this for the second time and the final action sequence was well over 30 minutes of non-stop action. Given the special effects were amazing and it was very fun to watch, it was just too much. It just kept going and going and going. It was about as relenting as watching a couple of kids play with the Transformers toys for over half an hour.<br /><br />The Decepticons previous to all of this had captured Sam's parents who bring so much to the film. They really are hilarious and believable characters played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White. I guess the Decepticons had kidnapped them in hopes of trapping Sam in Egypt, but then they are just set loose. Maybe the Decepticons forgot about them due to the chaos of the rigorous 30 plus minute climax?<br /><br />There are two huge moments in the film that were beyond the lamest of the lame. It's almost like everyone at the pitch meeting was yelling out ideas and then someone said, "Hey, let's just use all of them!" and then everyone agreed. Not to give too much away, one involves an idea that's been recycled a million times and takes place at Sam's dorm room with a pretty girl. How random was that? Once it's over it's never mentioned again. The second is Sam's destiny that's carried out at the climax. Why did he have to be the one to do this? A toddler could have been just as effective. After all of the other confusing and ridiculous moments in the film though, several of which I didn't even mention, these seem to fit with the rest pretty well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>There just did not seem to be an intriguing story behind all this. It's noisy and flashy and moves fast, but I never got emotionally involved. The two jiving robots were embarrassing and degrading, and I'm a white guy. Two dogs humping, and a robot humping Fox's leg...now that's what I call entertainment. The first Transformers had a story and was enjoyable. This one just assumed we cared about the characters, I think we needed a few scenes to get us re-involved with them. Then we would have been experiencing all the action vicariously thru them...not just watching in a detached way.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting much going into this film. I'm aware of director Michael Bay's history and his habit of making mindless popcorn films with huge explosions, scantily-clad women, and awful cheesy dialogue. Sometimes that's okay for me. However, I thought the first film was okay for what it was, so figured maybe I would like the sequel. I was wrong. "Revenge of the Fallen" is the most ridiculous campy, poorly-written and poorly-directed film to come out this year. The acting by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox is average, and the special effects are extremely well done. That's about the only saving grace for this film.<br /><br />The writing is so unbelievable you almost have to see it to believe it. At one point a character actually utters the line "not on my watch." No one in the history of the military has ever said this outside of a film. Reading over the screenplay, you would think it was some terrible Transformers fan faction written by a tenth grader and posted to the Internet. The dialogue is horrible. This would be a great movie if it was targeted to 9 year olds, but the overt sexual references and language suggest an older demographic. Maybe it's because Bay is trying to please a wide range of people, and maybe that's why we have jokes made about Transformer Testicles and there's a scene where a transformer (with a Jersey accent much less) tries to hump Megan Fox's leg. What possible reason is this robot trying to hump her leg? Is that the way they procreate? There is ZERO excuse for it other than a cheap laugh. And that's ALL the jokes are, cheap laughs. I honestly would not have been surprised to see a transformer fart in this film, or maybe a scene where a transformer gets high. It wouldn't matter if it made sense because an intoxicated transformer would be HILARIOUS. But don't worry, because there's plenty of scenes of Sam's mother accidentally getting high at college and proceeding to follow the Robin Williams/Jim Carey acting formula of physical humor. Then there are Skids and Mudflap - two Autobots who can't read, speak in "jive," act like gangster-wannabes, and fight a lot. One of them even has a gold tooth (I am not making that up). I am one of the last people you will meet who cares about things being politically correct or will ever claim anything is racist unless it is blatant, but this was a BLATANT stereotype. I cannot believe this made it into the movie. I wouldn't call it racist, but if these characters had actually been human, the NAACP would have freaked out.<br /><br />This movie is also insanely long, at a running time of 2.5 hours. This probably could have been avoided if there wasn't so much slow motion footage of people running. I was miserable after the first 45 minutes. Bay should have cut at a minimum, the last half hour off of the movie. The action scenes, while good, were way too confusing. The robots are so complex you can't tell what is happening since it's so fast and you can't figure out<br /><br />Transformers: "Revenge of the Fallen" is not Armageddon. It is not Bad Boys. It is definitely not the Rock. Say what you will about those films, they at least had somewhat decent plots and required some brain activity. This movie is nothing but pure mindless action, awful jokes, and gratuitous shots of Megan Fox (and only one of those is a good thing).</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>First off, the CGI effects are damn near perfect.  The computer artists are the only real talent that shows up on screen.  The script and dialogue sound like they were written by an 8th grader.  The film itself looks like a long music video.  Sometimes the camera will just NOT STOP MOVING.  It makes one dizzy after a while.  I guess the director and cameraman get mileage points.<br /><br />Some of the sexual content is WAY too inappropriate for the younger portion of the target audience.<br /><br />Shia LeBeouf looks like he's wearing a spray-on tan.<br /><br />"The bigger they are, the harder they fall."  Remember that, Megan Fox, when you are no longer the Hottie of the Moment.<br /><br />This movie, like the one before it and the three Star Wars prequels, was made to show off how spiffy the effects can look and THAT'S ALL.  No intelligent or coherent script.  This film is meant to be EYE CANDY ONLY.<br /><br />Kind of disappointing, too.  So much potential with the effects and budget, yet they took the "low road" in the Brains department.<br /><br />For the record, I didn't pay to see it (nor would I).  I snuck into the screening room after leaving a showing of "Public Enemies".  Not a single Space Robot in "Public Enemies" and yet it was a far, far superior film.  Go figure.<br /><br />Michael Bay movies have become their own genre:  loud, visually impressive, and dumb as a bucket of hair.  I don't think it bothers him or the studios for one nanosecond that so many people hate his films for being dumb and badly directed.  I don't think he's even trying to make a good film any more.  He specializes in Junk Food Cinema, and that's all you will likely ever get from him.<br /><br />He takes advantage of moviegoers with low standards.  And he'll laugh all the way to the bank.  One of these days he's gonna make a film so bad even his devoted fans won't like it.  But by then he'll be so rich he won't care, if he's not already.  Wait!  That's it!  He's ALREADY so rich he doesn't have to care!  THAT'S why his movies stink so bad.<br /><br />Believe me, the only artistically talented contributors to his films are sitting in air-conditioned offices at ILM and the other effects houses.  They produce the "wow" factor and Bay reaps the benefits and most of the glory.<br /><br />Skip this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AT7W1EXT0PF2Y.html">AT7W1EXT0PF2Y</a><br/><p>I ordered this DVD when it first came out, but have just now got around to reviewing it. When I bought it I decided to become a member of "Amazon Prime" mostly because I wanted to tell my friends "I bought Optimus Prime via Amazon Prime" (Don't ask)<br />After the novelty of telling my friends this had worn off, reality started sinking in. Mostly because I still hadn't received it. Even though Amazon Prime promises free 2 day delivery, it had been 3 days and no DVD. I called customer service about this, and they told me the 2 days was just an estimate. Apparently the company gets away with this because in the fine print it tells you that it's just an estimate. On day 4 my friends started teasing me because I didn't have the DVD even after bragging to everyone about it. It finally came on day 6 (day 5 was a sunday) but by that time nobody liked transformers any longer, children are fickle I guess. That hasn't stopped the local kids from calling me "Two-Day" as an insult however. Thanks a lot Amazon, Your Amazon Prime is an Amazon Crime!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>2009 was full of anticipated movies, with Transformers 2 being the most hyped about.  Opening during the summer with both regular and an extended-length IMAX versions, this movie quickly made back its $200 million budget and more.  But like many sequels, this was a big letdown from the first movie, as both critics and fans took jabs at the various parts of it.  Here is my take on why the movie sucked.<br /><br />First, the comedy was a rehash of that found in the first movie, except closer to the gutter.  Transformers 2 features humping dogs, a humping decepticon, and dialogue around sex among both couples, Sam and Mikaela, and Sam's parents.  Nobody really wants to see old people talk about sex, especially if they remind them of their parents.  The stereotypical parents are worse than before; the wife, Julie is ditzy, with her ditziness juiced up by some pot brownies.  The husband, Ron, is still a knucklehead; cheap, conniving, and loud-mouthed.  Besides the sexually-oriented comedy, we also have the racial jokes and stereotypes.  This time, instead of having Anthony Anderson playing a geeky homeboy, we have two autobots who talk, and act like gangsters from the hood.  Everything from their slang, use of profanity, to their notions about reading, seem geared towards attracting the East LA crowds of hoodlums and bro's into buying tickets.  And last but not least, John Torturro is back as Simmons, sarcastic, bombastic and pretentious.  Having watched this movie twice, once at the theater and now once on DVD, I finally realize that the entire comedy routine of both the 1st and 2nd Transformers movies is built on dichotomies.  Basically, half the character are dead-serious all the time, and the other half are ridiculous all the time.  There is no-one in between, no person who acts serious when needed, and then cracks an occasional joke at the right moments.  Every character fits and is defined by a specific stereotype.<br /><br />Second, the action scenes were totally unrealistic.  We see about a dozen autobots and several dozen decepticons in this movie.  All the decepticons are killed in battle except for Megatron and Starscream.  All the autobots live, except for Optimus, who is killed but brought back to life.  How is this possible, especially when many of the decepticons looked bigger and meaner than most of the autobots?  This was basically a robot version of Rambo or James Bond; the vastly outnumbered good guys never miss and never die of, while the bigger, meaner, bad guys all get killed of, with a couple of exceptions to make sure there is a sequel.  Its as if Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg took a storyline from one of the 80's action flicks, and replaced half the human characters with robots.  Utter lack of originality.<br /><br />Third, the storyline is chock full of holes.  The most visible example is at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  When Jetfire stands up and opens the door to go outside, we are suddenly in the middle of a desert airfield.  How do we go from Washinton D.C. to a desert?  Another example is when the decepticons go live on worldwide TV and threaten to destroy the world's cities if mankind does not give them Sam Witwicky.  We then see decepticons standing atop various towers throughout the world's cities.  And then nothing.  Its as if all the decepticons left.  Why not destroy a couple of cities to make good on their threat.  For an action movie about a war on earth, there seems to be minimal collateral damage of any sort!<br /><br />Probably the worst part of this movie is the dialogue.  All the transformers speak english almost the entire movie.  Even Soundwave, when giving orders from space, speaks in english.  Why would an alien race go out of their way to speak english.  The first Transformers movie was very realistic in that the decepticons always spoke their own language except when conversing with humans.  Why the letdown here?  Did Bay and Spielberg spend so much money on the explosions and other visual effects that they had to cut money on screenwriting some transformer dialogue in?  And then when the robots do speak, they have accents.  Why does Jetfire have an australian accent?  He lives in D.C., so if anything, he should have an East Coast or Virginian accent.  Its as if the movie makers decided that since australian actress Maggie Madsen was not in this movie, they could make up for her absence by having one of the transformers speak with an australian accent.<br /><br />And my biggest beef with the movie is the brazen copying of the POTC movies.  In the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, we have Barbossa die and then come back to life, then we have Jack Sparrow die and then come back to life.  Here in Transformers 1 and 2, we have Megatron die and come back to life, followed by Optimus Prime who dies and comes back to life.  Can we have some other plot device please?!<br /><br />All in all, this is probably one of the worst movies of 2009.  The only redeeming value is the package the DVDs came in, a case that opens up to become Bumblebee.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After the rousing, somewhat unpredictable success of the first "Transformers" film, Michael Bay and Co. set out to capture that winning formula once again in "Revenge of the Fallen".  Despite much critical panning and even outright derision, I cannot understand why this would be consider a let-down in any way, shape, or form.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Transformers 2" sees Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) entering college and leaving girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind.  When the Decepticons cook up another evil plan to destroy Earth, though, it isn't too long before Sam and Mikaela are once again teaming up with the Auto-Bots (as well as the U.S. military) to once again save the world.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the classic cinema case of "same concepts, different packaging".  The amounts of humor, pulse-pounding action, and plot (or lack thereof) are pretty much the same as the original, but director Michael Bay is able to keep the proceedings remarkably fresh.  Never once did I feel as if things were becoming "old hat".<br /><br />The key to enjoying this franchise (and even more so this film in particular) is this: have the ability to not take it seriously.  If you view these movies as strictly "escapism" entertainment, they will entertain you thoroughly.  Do they hold up to dissection?  Heck no.  But that isn't the point.<br /><br />As usual, LaBeouf pretty much steals every scene he is in as the young Witwicky.  He has the type of acting talent that perfectly meshed with the numerous "just passed adolescence" characters he played during this time period, and this makes Sam very relatable to the audience.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed "Revenge of the Fallen" nearly as much as its predecessor.  While the "newness" factor may have worn off a bit, this second effort (if viewed in the proper light) repackages the key elements of part one and lets us enjoy them again.  Despite all the negative publicity about this one, the Transformers fan who can fully immerse him/her self into the experience (without too much "thinking") CAN still have a blast watching this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>A thousand people will love this film, but i'm one of the few people who hated it. I first saw the preview and it didn't look so good back then. I love movies so I went to go see it anyway and boy did it suck. The Decepticons looked awesome but the movie followed every basic summer blockbuster cliche known to man. Here are some problems I hate with the film<br /><br />The red and green car followed Sam around and the little truck robot were all stereotypes. Red and green acted like gangsta's and reminded me of Jar Jar Binks in a way. They were so friggin annoying. The truck played off as a wise guy from Brooklyn. He reminded me of Frank from Men in Black but less cuter to look at.<br /><br />Sex. A movie staring Megan Fox had sex in it and it wasn't five stars?! Well if you consider two dogs humping and that little truck robot humping Megan Fox's leg as hot, then I guess you got issues.<br /><br />John Turturro's character in this movie was a direct rip off of Randy Quaid's character in Independence Day.<br /><br />Megan Fox was a sexy, there is no arguing that. She looked alot like Angelina Jolie in this film but way would you film more then half here scenes in slow-motion? But damn, she is friggin smoking.<br /><br />The humor was the kind of quick chuckle but doesnt last long kind. Make sense? I didnt laugh at anything in here but im sure plenty of people laughed at Sam's mom high on brownies. There was anther annoying character, sorry to digress but this film had some really annoying characters in it.<br /><br />The story lacked suspense as you could tell what was going happen before it happened.<br /><br />I cant really say I enjoyed to much of the film. The bad guys looked cool, some fights were pretty neat, and Megan Fox is smoking hot.<br /><br />All in all, it's a summer film. It's an escape from work or too get the kids off your back for a few hours. It's entertainment and not the meaning of life. I may have crapped on this film but I know thousands of people will go away saying it was the greatest film this summer or of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the most desperate attempts I have ever seen by a movie in its desperate ideas of entertainment. Coming only two years after the release of the first Michael Bay Transformers I knew this movie was not going to be anything special, because a sequel that is pushed into completion within two years is never a good sign. Regardless, I decided to hop over to see this movie after having spent a wonderful time with Pixar's latest release, Up (more on that delightfully entertaining movie some other time).<br /><br />This is the first time I shall really spoil a movie's plot points in a review, because trust me, if you are a rational human being you shall stay clear from this movie knowing its clich&eacute; plot and offensive characters. If you don't want to be spoiled don't read any further, but trust me when I say, even if you enjoyed the fun popcorn film that was Transformers(2007).<br /><br />The movie begins with what we find to be an alliance between the military and the Autobots from the first film as they work together in an attempt to destroy all remaining Deceptacons on the planet Earth. I suppose this was a better idea than simply repeating the exact formula of the first film, but it's just handled very childishly. This entire idea leads up to a huge, explosion filled fight with some sort of giant wheel-bot, that after a few minutes seems to be giving the Autobots the slip (of course in a Michael Bay film a giant robot destroying much of a highway is easy to cover up by the government. Durr-hurr). But what's this? A military cargo plane is flying overhead and heroic music has kicked in! Can it be? My God, it is! Here comes the toy world's most beloved robot character, Optimus Prime! Only problem is that Optimus seems to think he's in a 1980s cop film, because I wouldn't be joking if I say the first thing he tells the tinker-toy from hell after parachuting onto it was " Pull over!" Great! Optimus Prime has now become RoboCop! By the way, get used to one-liners like this- they make up most of the movie's dialogue.<br /><br />The first problem I find in this is that the first film implied that the entire remaining robotic forces of both sides were on Earth and that there were not many others. The way this film is I believe there are THOUSANDS of Decepticons and Autobots still left in reserve and will probably be seen in some giant Lord of the Rings style battle when the third entry comes round, because as bad as this film is it will undoubtedly make a lot of money no matter how bad the word of mouth.<br /><br />The military involvement is vague and they are, as is sci-fi tradition, failing to help in any way! Have you ever once seen a sci-fi/action movie where World domination seeking robots are brought down by machine gun fire? Makes you wonder what the humans are doing here in the first place! They're probably cushions for the robots whenever they fall- don't want those bright paint jobs ruined. Well, that would explain why so many of the robots in this film have red on some part of their paint job.<br /><br />Cut through the opening credits and go to our loving family from the first film. These segments between Sam, his parents, Bumblebee, and Sam's mechanic girlfriend (played by more curves than brains actress Megan Fox) are something that totally turns to movie upside down whenever they occur. No longer are you watching a mindless Rock `Em Sock `Em movie, but you've gone into a sitcom I like to call "That Robot Show." Whether it be Sam's dogs humping each other or his mother randomly getting off on pot-brownies these segments will stoop to anything in vain attempts to make you laugh (as if the absurd action sequences aren't funny enough of a joke). The worst part about this is that there are more of these sitcom scenes than there are actual Robot-versus-Robot moments. I know this is a brainless movie but I would rather see brainless violence than laugh-less "comic" interludes.<br /><br />Speaking of vain attempts at humor let me move right along to perhaps the worst aspect of this entire mess of a film: The Twins. Where to even begin with these unpleasant characters...Throw Jar Jar Binks into a ghetto, blend him up and split him into two and that would sum up how incredibly annoying these characters are, and if their presence wasn't enough to bother you they've made sure to provide you one of the most offensive portrayals of African Americans you will ever see in a big-budget action film. These robots...even their design screams of racist stereotype. One of them has big lips, another has big ears, and one even has a gold tooth (!!). I don't know who approved these characters or this portion of the script during development but surely no rational being could have thought these characters to be a good idea.<br />We also have some shameless rip-off of what appears to be The Terminator as a Deceptacon has taken to form of an attractive girl who seems to have her eyes set on Sam. You know something tells me that if I had the ability to take the form of humans I would use myself in a lot more productive manner than being a tease for college boys at Princeton (which seems to be a party university according to this film).<br /><br />None of the plot really makes sense other than to come up with as many cheesy one-liners and explosions as physically possible. When the bad guys chase Sam they don't pursue, or stalk him- they just choose to blow everything up at random. There is something called tension that even a bad film can pull off, and it does not involve constant wall-to-wall explosions. Go back to the first two Terminator films. Remember how intense it was to have our human characters in a factory where a deadly machine could be anywhere? This didn't involve any explosions, or gunshots, but it sure as hell managed to create tension and edge of your seat moments.<br /><br />This Transformers script came from the writing team of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who earlier this Summer movie season also had their names on the incredibly entertaining Star Trek reboot. So what went wrong with them in Transformers 2? Well, Star Trek had some racial stereotypes, and silly jokes, but they never became annoying or offensive to the viewers. Why? I give credit where credit is due, and that was the talent of director J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible 3, TV's Lost). Unlike Michael Bay, Abrams knew what was worth cutting and what was worth keeping in, and the result was a movie that brought laughs, intense action, whimsical characters, visually stunning special effects, and to top it off it was edited to perfection, running just a bit over two-hours. Transformers 2 seems to have had little to no editing, running at two-hours, thirty-minutes and the director - Bay - seemed so content with what he was doing he never stopped to question what he was doing.<br /><br />The result of Transformers 2 is an overly long, boring movies with very few memorable characters or action sequences...At least 300 had fun action sequences to make up for its absurd, poorly written script- same case with the first Transformers. The action sequences of Transformers 2 are miserable to watch because you can't tell what's going on unless the cheesy slow-motion moments are thrown in (and one even has a bad shot of Optimus being punched in the face and having...PURPLE ROBOT BLOOD fly from his mouth).<br /><br />I'll admit to liking some movies that involve turning your brain down a notch, the first Transformers film being an example of this, but this movie just went too far. At two hours and twenty minutes I thought the first film was forty minutes too long and this sequel is only longer and much less comprehensible. Some people say these films are the exact same thing and I have to strongly disagree. In the first film you could find the characters enjoyable and sometimes even whimsical. This one everyone is a cardboard cutout. First film the special effects were enough to dazzle you. This one they are so elaborate and over developed that you often had trouble understanding what was going on! This movie is an attack on your senses, plain and simple, though it's bound to make plenty of money and a third film will undoubtedly be spawned I can only say that no one will be talking about this series five years from now. It is just a passing fancy, something pretty to look at, like the cars showcased in this movie.  Whoever kept Michael Bay in-check for the first film needs to come back.<br /><br />Only good part of the film is seeing the new Corvette Stingray. Now that's a nice car, but not something [...] Luckily I snuck into this mess and paid nothing (and even then I want a refund).</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I'm not going to be snobby and say that there weren't parts of the movie I enjoyed.  I like explosions and robot fights just as much as the next guy.  Throwing in Megan Fox certainly helps to keep my interest.  The problem is that the movie is all eye candy.  It was okay to sit through once to see the great visuals, but there is not meat to the story.  Everything was a set up to get to the next battle, the next explosion.  I enjoyed some of the new robots, but the two ghetto bots grew increasing (jar jar binks) annoying as the movie went on.  My son loved the movie, and I am sure most other 10 year old boys will too.  As for adults, I think you can skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>The Good:<br />- Action, action, and more action.<br />- This movie must hold the record for the most things blown up in a movie.<br />- Main characters weren't too bad to look at.<br />- Special effects were kinda cool.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Plot - Robots needing to destroy our sun for energy?  Lame<br />- The mother being attacked by a non-transformed waffle iron.<br />- Almost all of the robot tag-alongs were completely annoying.<br />- Cheesy romance/break up scenes throughout the movie<br />- Robot balls, oompa loompa sighting, and humping robot.<br />- The fact that I didnt care if they saved the world or not or if the robots died or not.<br /><br />The movie provided some entertainment, although it was a little long.  Not terrible, but certainly not an amazing movie.  The comedic elements thrown in are just a distraction.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Contains some spoilers....<br /><br />OK, so basically, we are supposed to forget literally everything that happened in the first film, because it was all 'covered up' and that huge city battle in the first Transformers never happened, and none of those thousands of people saw or remembered ANYTHING and -yea. No. Michael Bay must certainly think his audience is incredibly stupid to have missed that ginormous plot hole. Oh, and apparently, robots can turn into perfect humans like in Terminator! Wow that is so amazing and believable!<br /><br />No seriously, Transformers 2 is pretty awful. It is 2.5 hours of explosions and super robots and pointless characters and no plot to speak of and a boring, predictable ending. And Megan Fox. Oh and clich&eacute;-ridden twin robots that spew profanities left and right. There is no point in properly reviewing this piece of garbage.<br /><br />I loved the first Transformers. It had the right balance of plot and action. Transformers 2 just doesn't know when to quit. Sad to think that all those millions of production dollars were utterly wasted.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>I will be up front: I gave this hateful film two stars because it had a few quality minutes...I say MINUTES.<br /><br />That is because I cannot tolerate anything getting a watered-down rating that it does not deserve. This smelly gym sock got a misleading PG, and I can't think of a better movie to tell parents to keep their little kids from seeing.<br /><br /> Let me be more explicit: MPAA ratings have deliberately fuzzed and confused lines between them. A PG-13 rating, for example, may contain some garbage that would offend sensitive or very moral adults. Yet its simple explanation is parents ought to be warned that a PG-13 film might contain material inappropriate for kids under 13.<br /><br />In other words, what the hell does that mean?? They can show what they want. TRANSFORMERS is an excellent example: it has torture scenes, lots of foul language, terrible violence and some sexually 'suggestive' material that I wouldn't really like 16-year-olds watching. Yet there it is...and this film should have been rated R.<br /><br />It is this type of evil Hollyweird bait-and-switch in film that I have come to resent. I've seen excellent films undeservedly rated R...why? Why rated R without any noticeable reason? Swearing? It's the only explanation I can find, yet TRANSFORMERS has more swearing than adults can perceive at the first viewing. (I'm sure kids hear it instantly.)<br /><br />The storyline is of ZERO interest to me, and it will be of zero interest to anyone over 9 years of age--ironically, this film isn't viewable by those under the age of 17. There is a great deal of frankly dirty humor, four-letter words fly like robot parts, Shia is tortured horribly in a particularly disgusting scene...<br /><br />...oh, and this thing had more TERMINATOR in it than TERMINATOR SALVATION had.<br /><br />There are sequels and what I call GELQUELS--and this is a gelquel because it made no sense, doesn't fit, has so much ugly garbage in it that I cannot believe this is what passes for a sequel. The original TRANSFORMERS was fun. It was a bit of fluff for kids, but it was intriguing to watch, the action was good (way too much military, just like this rotten offering), and you didn't have to hang your--or your children's--heads for seeing it.<br /><br />Heck, even my wife liked it and said Shia and the Transformers were cute.<br /><br />This film, no way. It is execrable all the way, and wishing will not change that soiled diaper. As a fan and film buff, I really, really hope Shia is going to start getting better roles than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Director Michael Bay has a lot of good movies under his umbrella.

However, whether writing, producing or directing, greatness has eluded them both. The aversion to greatness held true under their respective direction of Transformers and GI Joe.<br /><br />So who would win in a fight? Transformers RotF or GI Joe? Which movie is better?

Half of The Joes are lost in the first minute of fighting. Suddenly The Joes fire the nanotechnology-based weapon capable of eating metal and anything else that it comes into contact with. Most of The Transformers are disintegrated before they know what hit them. Out of mercy The Joes call off the nanotechnology and ask The Transformers for surrender. The Autobots agree.

OK, let's start with an equipment check. Blu-Ray & HDTV, sub-woofer cranked-up, lights out, popcorn in hand. Seat-belt on and here we go. Wow, you want action? You want loud booms and bangs? You want dizzing special effects? This is the movie for you! I just added ths to my list of favorite movies. The plot is relatively simple, but, it just gets in the way of the crashes, explosions and machine-on-machine combat. We have transformers from cockroach size up to monster size. We destroy a steel mill and some historical monuments. Some globe trotting with great scenery. But in summary, its all about the special effects and the transformers. A shout-out for the Blu-Ray version which has a second disk with more contents that the length of the original movie (well over 2 hours of behind the scenes). This movie is highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The first Transformers, while far from great, was one of Michael Bay's best films. I know that's not saying much, but it had unique SFX that should have won the Oscar and a sense of fun throughout. Revenge of the Fallen has even better visuals and a whole lot more action, but the dialogue and script are really weak this time around. There are a bunch of scenes that try way too hard to be funny and the addition of two "black" sounding robots who claim they can't read, brings back horrible memories of Jar Jar Binks. Shia Labeouf is okay in the first half of the movie, but he is given little to do or say after that.<br /><br />There are a couple of things that left me no choice other than giving it three stars. The SFX are outstanding and you can see more of what is happening in the fights. Megan Fox is not even close to being a good actress, but she is really something to look at. Michael Bay loves showing her off, especially her gorgeous face. The other hot girl (Isabel Lucas) tries to seduce Shia's character in college and she is near perfect in the looks department as well.<br /><br />Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a long movie and it feels that way, but I was entertained enough to say it is worth seeing in theaters if you liked the first movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>The first "Transformers" film may not be faithful to the animated series, not even to the comic book by Marvel comics. Seeing as how Hasbro only utilized those mediums to promote its toy line, I can forgive its inconsistencies to the beloved animated series. The original film by Michael Bay was fun, it utilized a simple formula with little room for a real intricate plot; it was just a popcorn film. After the huge box-office success of Bay's rendition of the "Transformers", of course there would be a sequel and "Transformers Revenge of the Fallen" fulfills that promise. Bay main goal would have to make the sequel bigger while going deeper into the mythos of our transforming robots. In this sequel, one thing, Michael Bay proves once again is the fact that he is a good director of action sequences but the skill of great storytelling still ELUDES him. "Transformers Revenge of the Fallen" may be louder and bigger--but it is definitely NOT better.<br /><br />Sam (Shia LeBeouf) is off to college. Life couldn't be better for the young man, he has a hot girlfriend named Michaela (devastatingly sexy Megan Fox) and his parents are very supportive. The Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) had joined forces with the U.S. military to hunt down the remaining Decepticons still on Earth. On the day that he is supposed to leave for college, Sam discovers a shard of the `Allspark' from an old sweater, the supposed source of life in Cybertron and his brain ends up being encoded with strange symbols. Prime and his companions come to the aid of the young man, and an encounter with the Decepticons end with a revived Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) sidelining the heroic Optimus Prime. Now it is up to Sam and Michaela to uncover the secret of the Transformers whose history spans hundreds of years on Earth. Aided by his roommate, Leo (miscast Ramon Rodriguez), former sector 7 agent, Simmons (John Turturro) and some old military friends (Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel), Sam must thwart the Fallen's machinations to bring about disaster by stealing the powers of the sun to make Energon through the powers of the "leadership matrix" key.<br /><br />I did not love the first film, but I thought it was fun and somewhat entertaining. It was a popcorn film that relied on slick hyper-editing tricks, CGI mayhem and visual disarray. "Tranformers" wasn't anything special but it was a crowd-pleaser, it appealed to mainstream audiences. Somewhere along the way, Michael Bay messed up an easy formula with "Revenge of the Fallen". This sequel is a display of pure undisciplined execution. One would ask; "How can Bay mess up a simple formula?" Well, it seemed like the director is trying too hard to outshine the original film by exercising the utmost minimum in restraint that relies mostly on rehearsed special effects and overbearing humor. I'm not sure whether he was trying to be funny or to be offensive.<br /><br />The problems with "Revenge" come mostly from its script.  I am not expecting a masterpiece or something that resembles an original plot, but the plot in this film totally uninspired. It's not that it didn't have some aces in the screenplay but somewhere along the way, Bay and company decided to opt for a comedic experience. The history of the robots is somewhat fleshed out, with the "Fallen" concept being brought into play. Unfortunately, any relevance to the film's main plot is downplayed by overdone annoying stereotypes in its characters; I am not just talking about the human characters, I am talking about the newer supporting cast of robots. (I will further elaborate in a minute) The Matrix key and the whole thing about the shards may hold some viability in the transformers mythos but sadly, the script falters, the film should be about the robots with the humans as the supporting element not the other way around. I would buy into the human-robot relationship and its significance but the film fails to fully realize this potential; it tosses in the idea but never develops it with emotion. I guess Bay thought that while the audience love to see robots fighting, they also like to laugh, so Bay and his writers puts a lot of emphasis on comedy; not just comic relief but actual comedy.<br /><br />The film brings a lot of comedy into the screenplay that it makes no emotional or narrative impact. The life and death stakes of saving the planet feels more like a backdrop than an actual inherent part of the screenplay. Any aces from its limited concept are diverted to useless detours from its narrative. The new robots feel like they're mere caricatures of certain stereotypes and the designs aren't impressive either. Most of the newer supporting robots act like they're rejects from some gangster comedy show. The twin `jive-talking' robots, Mudflap and Skids act like they're degenerates and play a very ethnic stereotype. I found their designs and behavior rather unnecessary and quite frankly may raise some racial flags. There is also a small Decepticon spy that behaves like a dog that it began to hump Megan Fox's leg. The film's script falls to many inadequacies and useless devices to try to entertain--to try badly. Using laughs as the central focus of the film diminishes the film's concept. I was NOT laughing at all.<br /><br />The question remains, does "Transformers Revenge of the Fallen" deliver on the "Heavy Metal" combat scenes? Yes, it does. The fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron with two other Decepticons was real fun to watch; it was a true testament to the heroic traits of Optimus Prime. The final encounter between a "maxed-out" Optimus Prime and "The Fallen" one was pretty cool although it threw another wrench in the screenplay. There are plenty of robotic battles and while some of them are good, some are pretty mediocre. It does try to evolve the areas of robotic combat and violence, but most of the new faces such as Sidewinder are ignored. The idea of a human-like Decepticon is sadly also abandoned and not fully fleshed out. We see classic Autobots, Iron Hide, BumbleBee and Decepticons, Soundwave and Rampage. An Insecticon and the Constructicons also make an appearance but their "Devastator" looks like a washing machine on steroids. Megatron's master, the Fallen one does look menacing but looks too reminiscent of the Japanese mecha designs. There is also an old Decepticon defector that uses a cane? The battles are good, but most of them feel too routine and a practice in rehearsal--lots of explosions and CGI mayhem does not make the qualities of an epic battle. Peter Cullen does a great voice-acting as Optimus and Hugo Weaving sounds menacing as the sinister Megatron.<br /><br />The film also features returning characters into the mix. Familiar faces John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel reprises their roles from the original film. Turturro is somewhat entertaining but I really thought that Ramon Rodriguez was definitely a miscast as Leo. Shia LeBeouf is his usual over-acting self, that all he did to express emotion is to widen his eyes with his mouth open. Megan Fox is indeed a Fox! The actress is so seductive as the sexy Mikaela that even a sexy Decepticon (played by Isabel Lucas) almost couldn't compete. Sam's parents played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White weren't funny and the pot joke is the type that has been overused by other films.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being too harsh to the film, but I think I should try to tell the truth. While the film does have some decent gags, the comedy just overstays its welcome. This is a film that assumes that comedy is gold and a scene with two dogs humping the other is a viable plot device. Michael Bay further cements the impression that he DOES NOT care for the franchise at all, and that any success the original film enjoyed was a fluke. I am rather at a loss as to what target audience this film is geared to, that I cannot give it a recommended rating. I suppose to be optimistic, those who just want a mindless summer film, "Transformers Revenge of the Fallen" may prove to be a minor diversion--but at 150 minutes the film proves too long. Bay isn't going to elevate this once-beloved franchise to new heights, and sadly, there are already hints at another sequel.<br /><br />It is a "FALLEN" sequel.<br /><br />RENT IT [2 ?- Stars]</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Michael Bay's "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is an aggressive, incomprehensible film that has no ambition other than to assault the senses with blinding special effects and a hell of a lot of noise. There's not a moment of entertainment to be found in any of its self-indulgent 150 minutes ... unless, of course, you find mindless action sequences and inconsequential plots entertaining. It follows the tradition of its equally God-awful predecessor by bombarding us with tangled images of destruction before pausing to be funny, although I use the term loosely since I never laughed, although I did smirk once at an outburst from one of the Transformer robots. I won't spoil it for you, seeing as there would no other reason to go see this film once you know what it is.<br /><br />The plot: Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is ready to go to college. Before he leaves, he discovers a broken piece of the cube from the first film, the one that can turn any inanimate object into a Transformer. Instantly, his mind is filled with bizarre symbols that somehow relate to the ongoing war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Once he's in school, he occasionally has severe mental overloads, causing him to talk incoherently and write out all the symbols in his head. With the help of his techno-geek roommate, Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez), and his girlfriend, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Sam tracks down the flustered Agent Simmons (John Turturro), who now works behind the counter of his mother's deli. Simmons has reason to believe that the Transformers have been among us for thousands of years.<br /><br />The Autobots, meanwhile, have since allied themselves with Earth armies to track down and destroy any Decepticons that have been in hiding. But it's a very shaky alliance, especially now that Decepticons are arriving from outer space and destroying major cities all over the world. A highly distrustful government official named Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey) seems to believe that they're only after the Autobots, not only because the remaining shard of the cube is under heavy lock and key, but also because the evil Megatron is slowly decaying at the bottom of the ocean. The leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), knows that Galloway is wrong and turns to Sam for help.<br /><br />Up in space, there awaits the malevolent Decepticon known only as The Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd), who, as the title suggests, wants revenge against Earth and the Autobots. Why? Who cares? Let's just leave it at this: If he didn't want revenge, there wouldn't be a movie.<br /><br />Back to Sam and his pals. They end up in the Egyptian desert for one reason or another and make a remarkable discovery in one of the three Pyramids. This, in turn, leads to the climactic battle between the Decepticons, Optimus Prime, and the American military. Funny how the Egyptian military (or any random Egyptian, for that matter) fails to notice that the Pyramids are being blown and smashed to smithereens. No matter; we're only supposed to pay attention to the action, and boy, is there a lot of it. I will say that I kind of liked the Transformer that used its mouth as a gigantic vacuum cleaner, sucking up sand as if it lived off of the stuff. Naturally, its throat is nothing more than a series of metal gears meant to grind whatever it sucks up into fine fragments.<br /><br />But wait--I haven't even gotten to the "funny" parts yet. In the course of this movie, we see a mini Transformer ravishing Mikaela's leg like a dog, Sam's beloved Bumblebee Camero SS crying at the thought of being abandoned, and Sam's mother (Julie White) accidentally eating a marijuana-laced brownie, after which she acts like a reject from a vaudeville slapstick routine. As if this weren't bad enough, two Transformers in particular cross the fine line between satire and insensitivity; disguised as a pair of compact hatchbacks, twins Skids and Mudflap (voiced by Tom Kenny and Reno Wilson) constantly argue with each other using slang-heavy ghetto street talk. The filmmakers take the stereotype one step further by giving one of them a gold tooth. This isn't funny. It's not even mildly amusing. It wouldn't be appropriate in any movie, let alone the sequel to "Transformers."<br /><br />I enjoy escapist entertainment as much as the next person. But my God, something went horribly wrong when Michael Bay decided to make two films based on action figures. "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is such a miserable experience, so loud, so visually unappealing, so terrible at finding a balance between action and humor. The story is jam-packed, but not with anything of interest or value. Absolutely nothing about the plot sinks in; it's a two and a half-hour exercise in storytelling without actually telling a story. The next time I want that kind of experience, I'll read a book with the TV on while playing a CD of exploding sound effects on my stereo system. I'll make sure to turn the subwoofer all the way up, because goodness knows feeling the sounds is just as important as hearing them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has a lot of flaws. Some are easier to overlook than others, especially with the nearly indescribable amount of mayhem exploding across the screen. While the CG effects have virtually perfected giant robots destroying everything in sight, the story department seems to have digressed into conjuring up outlandish situations that require even more preposterous solutions. Similar to the creation of Kryptonite to offset the invulnerability of Superman, several plot devices are devised as a way to counterbalance overly invincible Transformers, themselves created just to compete with the power of Autobot leader Optimus Prime. But of course, story isn't likely the primary reason to go see this film, and on an action scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a tank truck hitting a helicopter and 10 is an aircraft carrier colliding with a nuclear submarine, Revenge of the Fallen rates about an 11.<br /><br />Two years after the harrowing events of the first Decepticon attack on Earth, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) attempts to lead the normal life of a college student. But contending with overbearing parents, conspiracy-obsessed roommates, and a long distance relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) gives way to fending off lethally aggressive girls, alien symbol-induced mental breakdowns, and once again saving the world from transforming robots intent on destroying the universe.<br /><br />Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen certainly proves that bigger is not better. In its attempt to outdo the first film with louder sound effects, more destructive explosions, bulkier robots and grander comedy relief, it fails to square off against the appeal of its predecessor: originality. The transformations, the battles, the firepower, and the obnoxious amount of side characters are just too familiar; nothing about this sequel boasts an increase in creativity, just a boost in excess.<br /><br />This plays into the use of plot contrivances - those pesky solutions to the random problems that are pointlessly devised to keep the story complex and always changing. While most are so drastically unpredictable that knowing about them would ruin the surprise, the plot suffers from a lack of rules. Since the limits of almost everything surrounding the Transformers are never clearly defined, Revenge of the Fallen runs amok creating new origins, lore, abilities, characters and boundaries of mortality, with little rhyme, reason or concern. When a space bridge is introduced for brief teleportation, it's both unnecessary and completely unconvincing. And that's a problem in a movie about alien creatures that camouflage themselves as mechanical vehicles, which starts with little basis in reality in the first place.<br /><br />Almost the entire cast of the original returns, with even more new characters thrown into the mix; much of their involvement is for a few extra laughs that add nothing but running time. The witty banter between father, mother and son is almost too much to bear, the racial stereotype Transformers (Mudflap and Skids) are like Jar Jar Binks at best, and Megan Fox remains spotlessly clean no matter how many explosions she gets thrown from or the number of times she rolls around in the dirt. Design elements from The Matrix, Species, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and more make their way into this lengthy continuation, and despite the spectacular special effects and insanely monstrous new enemies, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen can't offer enough truly fresh material to warrant this overlong, mind-bogglingly destructive summer blockbuster. It did, however, introduce twin Transformers.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Not impressed with this second Transformers movie.<br /><br />Too many sexual jokes that just were not funny, too much screen time of "The Twins" and not enough of Optimus Prime. (The only reason to see a Transformers film)<br /><br />Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen brings back the characters from the first movie:<br /><br />Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky<br />Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes<br />Josh Duhamel as Major Lennox<br />John Turturro as Agent Simmons<br /><br />And John Leguizamo wannabe Ramon Rodriguez as Leo Spitz.<br /><br />I've already mentioned the sexual jokes that had no purpose in this film. They weren't funny and were totally inappropriate.<br /><br />The lack of Optimus Prime (no spoilers): he isn't in this film very much. BIG, HUGE mistake Mr Bay and your writers. And instead you fill that time with two minor autobots who try to be funny (think Jar Jar Binks).<br /><br />The action sequences were better. I could follow who was fighting whom. And the explosions - I liked the nice big one at the end - were nice eye-candy.<br /><br />But the story was the best they could do considering the Writer's Strike of last year. With all the new robots, it's hard to create a character-driven story like the last one (what am I saying?!?!?!).<br /><br />You can definitely tell how Michael Bay feels about President Obama and his foreign policy. The jabs given are aimed at liberals and those who aren't too keen on the U.S. military. Speaking of the military, they really get to shine and explode in this film as they do most Michael Bay films.<br /><br />Even though it's raking in the big bucks (think Spider-Man 3), people will remember this sequel as another poor attempt at milking a franchise. And it's only the second film!<br /><br />This film may even fail to be picked up and added to my DVD collection (A true sign of lameness). Let's hope Transformers 3 will be the final film.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>When I went to the theaters to see this movie I was expecting alot, since it had already earned a good sum of money. However that night I left the theaters disapointed. The reason I felt this way is because there was not a very good plot. I think the biggest reason why this movie made such a large sum of money is because of the special effects, all the transforming and Meghan Fox.<br />I thought there was good acting in this film but if there is not a very good plot good acting can only carry a film so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>Um...that's it for 2:30 min.<br />Acting is pretty bad.<br />Dialogue is pretty bad.<br />Special effects....pretty good.<br />Save your cash and more importantly YOUR TIME.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>Well, at least that's what it seemed like.  Whereas most sci-fi movies have characters and special effects, this movie has so much and so many special effects that they aren't special anymore.  They are the movie.  The characters are there just to provide a minimal vehical for a story to wrap special effects around.  I'm glad I saw this in a way that I didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />Oh, and Megan Fox is beautiful enough in her own right without these posed glamour shots that seem designed only to provoke teenage lust.  To bad she didn't actually do more, you know, like acting and stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>I found this film to be interesting and engaging.  I have been a fan of Transformers since childhood, watching the cartoon often.  This film carries the Transformer torch, and does it with good results.  Ever present is danger, and the possibility of defeat, but Sam and Optimus conquer all, in this all-out battle for the very fate of planet Earth.  Seamless renditions of both Autobot and Decepticon Transformers using computer animation, and a very tight film overall.  Great special effects, and powerful soundtrack.  Five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I just got back and I loved the movie. The special effects were amazing. The action was top notch. I find the criticism that the story was stupid, laughable. It's a movie based on toy robots that transform. How much dumber could it get? This movie isn't about the story. It's not trying to win Oscars. Just sit down and enjoy it. I really think the people hating on this movie, and other movies like Wolverine, go into it looking for things to criticize. My advice to them is: If you don't want to like the movie, if you're going to hate it no matter what, don't see it!<br /><br />To every reasonable person, this was a great summer movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is a great sequel that's just as awesome as the original, and highly lived up to my expectations! Everybody did an awesome job. The storyline seems a lot darker than the original. There is more comedy, emotional moments, and a lot more fighting. It's been two years since the Autobots helped Sam Witwicky defeat the Decepticons. As Sam leaves for college, he finds a piece of the Allspark, which causes him to see visions of Cybertronian symbols in his mind. Megatron is resurrected, and brings the Fallen to Earth, so they can finish what they started, and try to use the Matrix of Leadership to destroy the Sun. Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots must stop the Decepticons once again. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. His MTVish, everything looks like a commercial, hyperactive directing style caters to the lowest-common denominator of film-making. Everything he has ever done has been so over-the-top and ridiculous, I personally think it's embarassing that his movies make as much money as they do. He insults our intelligence by removing creativity and replacing it with mind-numbing, "what the heck just happened", "that was ridiculous" explosions.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed TRANSFORMERS (the first one). It seemed to me that Michael Bay had finally found a movie where he could be his arrogant over-the-top self and nobody would notice. I mean, how more over-the-top can you get than robots that transform into cars, boats, planes and whatever else they feel like.<br /><br />Yet, TRANSFORMERS 2: RISE OF THE FALLEN showed Bay's over-the-topness in a different way. The least of which is the ability to shoot some of the most unnecessarily sexist shots of Megan Fox I've ever seen in a movie. The first time we see Mikaela Banes (Fox), she's leaning forward on her motorcycle in her short short shorts for everybody to drool over. Look, I appreciate the beauty that is Megan Fox just like the next guy. She's smokin' hot, but that camera shot is hands down, the most unnecessary camera shot in the history of film. Sure, for a sex movie or Basic Instict or such, but not TRANSFORMERS, a movie that is based off of a popular set of toys, cartoons and is catered toward young people.<br /><br />On top of that, we have to witness the unnecessary hanging testicles of one robot and countless other unnecessary instances.<br /><br />Then of course there's the action sequences that are so fast and confusing it had me thinking of SPEED RACER and how the creators needed to just tone it down a notch. Wrestling matches between robots become just a pile of twisted metal. Just F/X rolling around on screen.<br /><br />The entire final sequence was so rapidly edited and over here, over there, over here again, over there, here's a new place, who's that, what side is that robot on? who just got blown up? oh, there's some giant robot testies, explosion here, explosion there, run there, run here... and it's over.<br /><br />I had actually started to find a small place of appreciation for Michael Bay after the first Transformers movie, but now he's right back in the cellar with me. Too bad though. This isn't a bad movie. There are a lot of funny, entertaining, well-constructed moments in RISE OF THE FALLEN, it was just a movie that was poorly handled by an arrogant director who thought he had to do way too much stuff.<br /><br />I wanted to give it 2 stars, but there is enough entertainment to make it a worthy watch. It just could have been so much more if Michael Bay had an ounce of tact in his repertoire.<br /><br />Less is more Bay. Less is more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>First and foremost, let's get the positives out of the way.  The action and special effects in this movie are incredible.  It's nothing less than one would expect.  During all the battle scenes, and especially during the scenes around the pyramids, there are some incredible, sphincter-tightening, tense moments.  For sci-fi fans and special effects fans, this may well be in the pantheon.  Transformers II is a "shut your brain off" good time, with explosions, transforming cars, crisp action scenes, and a decent enough plot that has the feel of a National Treasure sequel.  But with alien cars that can shape-shift.  And speaking of that, this movie makes a significant improvement over the original by giving more attention to the Transfromers and less to the humans.  Now that that's out of the way...<br /><br />Let me get this right.  Shia Lebouf's character goes away to college, leaving the impossibly hot Megan Fox and his shape-shifting car back home?  Let's back up one second, because that's just too colossally ridiculous.<br /><br />He leaves Megan Fox - who is clearly about 500 miles, 250 football fields, and 98 fathoms out of his range - his current girlfriend that will epically dwarf all other possible girls and/or women with which he'll ever be with, or probably even see in college (read: ever), to go to a far off college that requires a webcam for communication?  You're telling me there wasn't a diesel engine tech school nearby?  Any time an integral story arc derives from American Pie II, and the movie is not meant as a ridiculous yet enjoyable comedy, it's usually a bad thing (even Jim realized he screwed up by leaving Nadia and would never have a chance with a woman like that again).  All of this, of course, is secondary on the WTF-scale to the fact that he actually leaves Bumblebee behind.<br /><br />Bumblebee, his sentient, alien, shape-shifting car who not only helped Shia land Megan Fox, but also helped save his life, and can pull up any song in the history of songs on merely a whim - which is like having a 1-million disc CD-changer - being abandoned is just too hard for me to believe, even if it is a Michael Bay blockbuster without common sense.<br /><br />It's a fun movie with a few unnecessary parts, and some really stupid humor shoved in, but overall I'd recommend it (mainly for Megan Fox and the action).</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is a great sequel that's just as awesome as the original, and highly lived up to my expectations!

Just saw it for the first time last night (I rarely go out to the movies so as to avoid the rude masses that usually attend them) and it is so extreme I felt compelled to throw up a review. Let's get a couple of things out of the way right now:<br /><br />1. Characters - Incredibly annoying. Shia LaBeouf is the most annoying of them all. His constant hyper over the top delivery gets old, and, not to be redundant, but annoying! He needs to start drinking decaf because he is way too much to take for an entire movie, especially a 2.5 hour movie. Sam's parents are throw away characters, his new college roomate is almost as annoying as he is, and even the normally likeable John Turturro is silly in this movie. Megan Fox, well what are you going to say about her, she could probably spend the entire movie with drool coming out of her mouth and she would still be super hot. This movie exploits her hottness and for that I congratulate them (director, producer etc.). Even my girlfriend who is beautiful in her own right has to admit Megan Fox is super beautiful. For the males in the audience she is a big plus for this movie (and the previous Transformer's movie too).<br /><br />2. Plot - What plot?<br /><br />3. Writing - Dumb, ridiculous, and nonsensical.<br /><br />So, how do you give a movie that has poor acting, annoying characters, zero plot to speak of, and a poor script five stars? Well easy, what it does right it does really right, and that happens to be special effects and explosions, lots and lots and lots of explosions! This movie won't make you smarter, it won't leave you to contemplate life and your purpose here, it won't make you feel sad or happy, all it will do is dazzle you and probably exhaust you with non-stop action and dazzling special effects. CGI for the robots is incredible. Yes, when they do their transforming bit and occasionally during battle scenes it's really difficult to tell what the heck is going on, but for the most part these things are incredible. The transformers that show up at the end of the movie for the big battle (and I do mean big) in Egypt are quite the show, they are simply enormous. For a little comic relief there are two twin robots and they cracked me up! They have big ears and teeth and they are constantly fighting with each other, but they made me laugh with their constant banter and goofiness.<br /><br />While I haven't read any of them I noticed this movie got lots of bad reviews, not sure why, not sure what people will expecting out of a transformers movie? If they were expecting high art, a plot, good acting, or any of that other stuff that normally constitutes a good movie I think their expectations were way out of line. If you approach this movie with the frame of mind of "entertain me, I want to grab my box of popcorn and I want you to entertain me with high production values, incredible special effects, lots of stuff blowing up, and non-stop action," well you will be very satisfied indeed. For what it was I loved it, there isn't a dull moment. My girlfriend hated, I loved it. Definitely a movie made with guys as the target audience.<br /><br />I do want to add I'm no Transformers fan. I did not watch the Transformers cartoons when I was kid, I haven't read any Transformer comic books (I'm assuming there are some?) and I didn't know anything about them until I saw the first movie (which I also loved). So if you're a Transformers fanboy snob who knows, maybe you'll hate this movie for whatever reasons fanboys hate movies about their favorite characters. As a non fan with no previous affiliation or emotional investment in the series, for me it was just great entertainment.<br /><br />Final word, best popcorn movie I've seen in years!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>In order to comment you have to give a minimum of one star. Didn't the Amazon programmers ever get past basic additive and subtractive mathematics? For example, I would give this movie two stars for it's CG effects. However, I would remove one star for excessive redundant and visually too-fast-for-appreciation CG effects. I would remove one star for a rambling poorly constructed and not very creative plot. I would remove one star for rote stereotypic read-the-script acting. Then remove a star for a formula script. And, as most everyone else has stated, remove another star for writers & directors not knowing their target audience. Finally, remove two more stars for language appropriate only for 17 to 19 year olds and sexual innuendo appropriate for never-got-around-to-growing-up adults.<br /><br />I'm not very good at math, but I think it's about -5 rating.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In 2007, the often critically maligned, yet still box office powerhouse, director Michael Bay ("Pearl Harbor") presented us with his vision of bringing gigantic transforming robots to life on the big screen. It was big, bold, loud, funny, and above all incredibly entertaining, not to mention taking many audience members by surprise in terms of just how much fun the movie was. I mean seriously, here was a movie based on an animated series from the 80's that was itself based on a toy line from Hasbro. How could that movie be anything but absurd? Yet, somehow Bay and his writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman ("Star Trek") found a way to make it work that was believable and enjoyable to audiences, thus leading to an incredible amount of money being spent at the box office. Which brings us to the summer of 2009; two years after the initial movie blew audiences away, the inevitable sequel to the smash hit "Transformers" has arrived.<br /><br />"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" picks up approximately two years after the events in the first film. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is preparing to head off to college sans girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) and car/guardian Bumblebee. However, Sam's higher learning shall have to wait as the evil Decepticons have returned to Earth at the behest of their overlord, The Fallen, to locate an ancient artifact of Cybertronian origin that is hidden somewhere on the planet. If the Decepticons locate the relic it would spell certain doom for humanity and the Autobots. Now, Optimus Prime and company must band together to fight their deadliest foes in an effort to ensure that Earth and its people have not seen their last days.<br /><br />If you saw the original film, and judging by the box office numbers not too many people didn't, then you kind of know what may be in store for you with the sequel. Everything that worked so well in the previous movie is back, bigger and better than ever for this one. Not to diminish how great "Transformers" was as a movie, because it was incredible; however in my opinion, it was simply the opening act, and "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is the main event.<br /><br />If you presumed that this film was going to be a visual effects extravaganza with a plethora of explosions, then you would be correct; however, it isn't just a brainless exercise in blockbuster movie making courtesy of Michael Bay as some would have you believe. Written by returning screenwriting duo Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with writer Ehren Kruger ("The Ring Two"), the story for "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is much more epic and grand in both scope and size than that of the previous film. In conjunction with all of the visually intensive action sequences, the writing team maintained the quick-witted banter of Sam, increased the presence of his romance with girlfriend Mikaela, and built upon the friendship and camaraderie between him and the Autobots. The film also has some quieter, more introspective moments, as Sam struggles with being a young adult trying to discover who he will be as a man. Meanwhile, he is also keeping secret the fact that his car is a member of an alien race hiding amongst us and that certain members of that alien race may return someday to destroy him and everything he cares about. Talk about having some internal baggage to carry with you. All of these story elements together create a movie experience that has more going for it than being just another mindless action flick.<br /><br />The original film was truly an achievement in the realm of visual effects by making giant, life-like, transforming robots into a reality. With the sequel, the talented crew at Industrial Light and Magic have topped themselves yet again by delivering an even bigger smorgasbord of extremely detailed (as they were in the first one) Transformers to feast our eyes upon. Plus, because of the fact that their arrival on Earth had already been chronicled in the first film, this one allows us to see the two warring sides of this alien race much sooner, and they are much more prominent in the story as a result. I didn't know how far technology had come in the realm of CGI in the short time since the previous movie, but it appears that the capabilities these wizards now possess are leaps and bounds above what was available two years ago. For me, "Revenge of the Fallen" possibly sets the new standard for visual effects by which all other movies may be judged.<br /><br />Returning to join the Autobots in their war against the Decepticons are the two leads in the film, Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, as Sam and Mikaela. Their two characters have matured quite a bit since the last movie, and are now trying to find their place in the outside world. Both characters are also more proactive in this film, and are working hand-in-hand with the Autobots in the effort to thwart the Decepticons' evil plans. Another aspect of their roles worth mentioning is that their relationship onscreen is very believable, and their commitment to each other in the trying times that follow is a commendable trait that is often found lacking in today's society.<br /><br />Alongside Shia and Megan are supporting cast members John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, and Tyrese Gibson. All of these supporting characters are given more to do this time around. Although the characters of Lennox and Epps (Josh and Tyrese respectively) command more respect than last we saw them, it is Turturro's eccentric former Sector 7 Agent Simmons that has undergone the most change. No longer an agent of the government, Simmons has been relegated to working for his mother. I liked Turturro's performance in the original film, but his work in this one is even more enjoyable, and his eccentricity seems even better suited to his character now that he is a civilian.<br /><br />Also returning for more are character actors Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents. In this movie their characters are featured a little bit more in the story, still not major players, but the time they do get on the screen they make the very best of. Both offer several moments of levity, especially Julie White, but we also get to see them go through the difficulty as a parent having to let go of a child who's growing up. Hopefully we will get to see even more from them in the inevitable third film.<br /><br />Lastly, the actors giving voice to the various Transformers once again do an excellent job of bringing these characters to life. From returning talents Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) and Hugo Weaving (Megatron) to newcomers Frank Welker (Soundwave), Tony Todd (The Fallen), and Tom Kenny (Skids), each member delivers a solid performance that perfectly compliments the flawless computer-generated imagery that created these robots. One last thing regarding the voice-over actors, to be truthful saying Frank Welker is a newcomer to Transformers only applies to this movie. In reality, Welker provided many of the voices in the original animated series, most notably those of Megatron and Soundwave.<br /><br />Boasting an even bigger scope, more action, humor, and almost 3-times as many robots than its predecessor, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is a pulse-pounding, fast-paced thrill ride that will entertain you from beginning to end.<br /><br />"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>It's clear that Michael Bay specifically tailored this movie for a certain type of audience. The type that loves to hear the actors say things such as "Punk A**" and "P****". Yes, the P word (I thought I saw a ***** cat) is used to make fun of someone in this movie.<br /><br />Also, scenes with the boys pet dogs having sex, many sexual references to the female actress, and 2 "urban" transformer twins who kept cursing and fighting each other. I guess "urban" transformers love to curse and fight each other.<br /><br />If you have a "properly functional" brain inside of your head, then save your money and skip this worthless movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>The original Transformers movie is an ultimate favourite of mine and I was delighted when I first heard there was going to be a sequel and Bay was going to turn up the juice. Unfortunately, in comparison to the first movie, this fell flat in many ways and left me feeling a bit empty when leaving the theatre. The amount of Transformer characters in this movie is four times as many and they have a more prominent presence on Earth in terms of their co-operation with the government in tackling the Decepticon menace.<br /><br />The story is set two years after the original. More Autobots have come to Earth and formed a government alliance with the humans known as NEST which has the aim of eradicating the Decepticon presence on Earth. We see the return of our favourite Transformers and our favourite human characters such as Sam Witwicky (LaBouf), Mikaela (Fox), Major Lennox (Duhamel), Agent Simmons (Turturro) and Master Sergeant Epps (Gibson). This time the humans and Autobots face their biggest enemy to date as they have to tackle one of the original Transformers, from the Dynasty of Primes known as the Fallen.<br /><br />17,000 BC the Dynasty was on Earth and the Fallen wanted to harvest the sun which would provide Energons for the AllSpark. His fellow Primes disagreed with his plan as Earth was inhabited by humans so, in order to prevent him from starting the sun harvester destroying the planet, they sacrificed themselves and hid the Matrix of Leadership which powered the harvester. The Fallen vowed to take his revenge on Earth by finding the Matrix and starting up his sun harvester and destroying the humans. Now in the present, Sam Witwicky is going to college, Soundwave has joined the Decepticon forces by hacking into a government satellite to mobilise those who will help The Fallen achieve his revenge.<br /><br />On paper the plot sounds like it could work wonders and translate into one hell of a blockbuster extravaganza, however, what it translated to was a film that didn't seem to know where it was going and what it was trying to achieve. The human characters had to naturally take a step back in order to make way for the new and larger presence of the transformers, but what this meant is that the film makers still needed a reason to keep them around which ultimately, was ridiculous. The goofy humour is back but becomes way too childish for my liking. Bumblebee peeing on one of the Sector 7 agents in the first movie was pretty funny but, despite what imbeciles will tell you, dogs humping aren't. Sam's parents are also given a bigger and more annoying role as an attempt at some form of comic relief and also end up falling flat by destroying the plot line by breaking away from an important moment in the movie to see the parents being stupid.<br /><br />Talking about a lesser point of the human characters, although this is to make way for the higher level Transformer storyline, it does end up meaning you don't care what happens to any character. One of the more important people in the movie does get killed and I just found myself thinking "who cares?" which is something you don't want in a movie. The fighting in this sequel has been altered somewhat to get away from the confusion of the fight sequences of the first film. One of the better battle sequences pits Optimus against Megatron and Starscream. The look and set up for the battle is really well done and presents an exciting scene that presents the enjoyable aspect of this film.<br /><br />There's much more good and bad that I could talk about this movie, but I think it's best that you discover that for yourself. If you liked the first film then you will enjoy this but feel a bit dry coming out of it and there's the likelihood you will still prefer the first live action film. Character voicing is good, human acting is OK and the pacing and construction of the story is abysmal to say the least. When you blend them all together you are presented with a summer blockbuster that is just OK and nothing more than that. Judging by the fact that Michael seems to have learned from his mistakes of the first film, I'm hoping that if he does make this a trilogy, he manages to repair the numerous mistakes made by this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Just as bad as all the reviews have said. I really enjoyed the first one, it was great summer escapism. But this follow-up just meanders from one sequence to the next, with no attention paid to plot or characters. Even the humor seems canned, and the young lead actors are already phoning it in.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>A little over two years ago, I saw Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen in theaters during a midnight screening on its day of release. Somehow I managed to sit through a two and a half hour movie, drive home, write a review, post it, and promote it all before I went to bed that morning at 5am. Looking back, I still have no idea how something like that was accomplished while also juggling a full-time job. Needless to say, I've been eager to revisit Revenge of the Fallen ever since. Delirium begins to set in at that hour and midnight screenings are rarely ever not fun. Not to mention my skills as a movie critic have evolved greatly since then and my tastes have altered. The movie deserved a proper review with a sober state of mind. And yes, thankfully, the trip was worth taking because I'm not quite as enthusiastic about Revenge of the Fallen being such a great piece of cinema as its glaring flaws tend to overshadow what little good it had going for it.<br /><br />The writing is obviously the sequel's biggest flaw and not just the storyline, but the dialogue as well. The Fallen touched down on earth all the way back in 17,000 B.C. and while we've been able to uncover the likes of cavemen existing thereabouts during that time period, there's no evidence of autobots or decepticons existing in that point in history. With the way they fight and their vast numbers, that seems pretty hard to believe. Oh, and look, Sam has held onto the shirt he wore when the world almost came to an end in the last movie and apparently hasn't ever washed it. A sliver of the allspark has just been sitting in that thing this entire time. Alice actually being a decepticon didn't feel right either. Probable maybe, but it just didn't seem to fit with all other transformers being vehicles of some kind. Meanwhile Soundwave is a satellite in this movie, but walks around on earth with some crazy worm thing in Dark of the Moon with no reason of him evolving between films.<br /><br />The movie has a thing about humping, too. We see two male dogs humping on more than one occasion and Wheelie also humps the crap out of Megan Fox's leg, but that's not the only time male genitalia comes into play. We also get a good glimpse at the testicles of the Sun Harvester as John Turturro spits out a one-liner about its scrotum. Leo and his freaking out over absolutely everything is also really annoying and makes Shia LaBeouf's "BUM-BULL-BEE!!!" and "OP-TIM-US!!!" squawks feel like a breath of fresh air. Sam's parents are practically the kryptonite of the movie as they're featured way too much and in the worst of times. Sam's mom has the lamest dialogue while also overreacting to everything while his dad can't decide to let Sam go or protect him. Why they were ever even Egypt is a boggling question in itself. Why are there autobots in heaven? If Megatron's master was The Fallen and he took orders from Sentinel Prime in Dark of the Moon, just how many other Decepticons does he answer to? The questions and plot holes just seem endless.<br /><br />The atrocious dialogue practically echoes through your bones. It starts with Ironhide saying, "Punk ass decepticon," and never really lets up. Between Sam's parents "smelling" a "$40,000 education," and Simmons telling everyone that what he was about to show them was "top secret" and "do not tell my mother," the bases are pretty much covered. Military sergeants listening to a kid in college seems outlandish anyway, but throwing their absolute blind faith in him seems really outrageous. I realize the cast of the movie had the writer's strike to deal with, but two of the three writers for Revenge of the Fallen also wrote Star Trek which showed none of the same problems that this movie had. The writing in a Michael Bay movie is already secondary. Throw in a writer's strike and you've got something as apocalyptic behind the camera as what's taking place on screen.<br /><br />There is something entertaining deep within the loins of this cinematic abomination though. The special effects are more than satisfying and pretty much outshine the special effects in the first movie. Onscreen battles are more extraordinary, explosions are bigger, and the numbers are more massive. It feels more like an actual war this time around. Bumblebee also gets his time to shine in the sequel. His scene in the garage with Sam at the start of the movie is one of the better calm scenes in the entire thing and then there are his fight scenes. Several of the fight scenes seem inspired by Mortal Kombat; Bumblebee's spine-rip sequence and Optimus' face ripping and hand bursting through the chest of The Fallen with its villainous heart. Optimus feels very scarcely used in the two Transformers sequels. He has a few scenes where he gets to be awesome and then spends a good portion of the movie being incapacitated. At least he was dead in this one, that's a liable excuse. In Dark of the Moon, he's basically just hanging out upside down for thirty to forty minutes while hundreds of people die. Even though The Fallen is dealt with in a matter of minutes, he is kind of cool. He teleports a lot like Nightcrawler and is voiced by Tony Todd. Unfortunately, he's only appealing on the surface, kind of sucks as a main villain, and is a total embarrassment to the decepticons.<br /><br />Michael Bay needs to learn that more explosions and more destructive mayhem don't automatically make a film better than its predecessor. There are more battles between the autobots and decepticons, the stakes are higher, and the special effects are more impressive, but it's essentially just eye candy or like giving reconstructive facial surgery to a really hideous person; they're still ugly but their appearance is at least nice to look at now. With a storyline that jumps all over the place for no rhyme or reason, really terrible dialogue being spewed from just about every major character, and The Twins probably being more offensive than they are humorous, Revenge of the Fallen falls short of being half as good as Bay's original effort and is quite difficult to think of as anything more than a guilty pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>this movie was fantastic. there was a ton of action. the desert fighting reminded me of the 1st Transformers movie. Megan Fox reprised her role as Mikaela Banes, Sam Witwicky's love interest. there was some funny moments in the movie. the two compact Autobots cracked me up, and when Judy Witwicky was eating hash brownies and revealed to the female co-ed students that Sam was no longer a virgin, and when Bumblebee fought back against the kitchen appliances that came to life when the shard came near them. this was an excellent summer movie and I hope Transformers 3 is good too. if you didn't like this movie there is something wrong with you. I recommend this movie to those that are kids at heart. there is a couple of moments where cuss words are uttered, but this is an awesome movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen" is great! This is how the story goes: With the help of the Autobots, the soldiers of NEST, and an old adversary-turned-ally, Sam and Mikaela must uncover the secret history of the Transformers presence on earth, and the sacrifices that have to be made to save it from an ancient threat sworn on returning here for revenge... an ancient Decepticon named THE FALLEN.<br /><br />The cast led by Shia LaBeouf (as Sam) & Megan Fox (as Mikaela) is great! The directing by Michael Bay (also executive produced) (who also directed the first "Transformers" (2007), he also produced "The Unborn" (2009), "Friday The 13th" (2009) and is also producing the upcoming remake to "A Nightmare On Elm Street" (2010) is great!

This is a fun and action-packed film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is one of the best movies of the summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>This movie was ok, but it didn't really make me care whether or not there's a part 3. If there is they need a more talented director like JJ Abrams. Michael Bay did a better job with the first film. This one has less of a head on it's shoulder. I think with sequels Bay will just give us the same stuff over and over again. Megan Fox in tight clothes running and screaming in slow motion "not that there's anything wrong with that lol", Decepticons after Sam and Autobots having to protect him and the humans being more developed and shown more than the Transformers.<br /><br />  The fights between the Autobots and Decepticons are just messy and the movement is so quick that it's hard to keep up with what's going on. While the Transformers are just side characters in their own franchise, everything is more about Sam and his girlfriend (Megan Fox). We are hardly introduced to any of the new Autobots. The 2 new Autobots to me were as painful as 2 Jar-Jar Binks. They were annoying. While the film could have used characters like Hot Rod or the Dinobots. But even if they were in it, I don't think we'd even be introduced to them or be made to care about them. The only Autobot that we were ever made to really care about in the films is Bumble Bee, we don't really care if any of the others get ripped apart since they are undeveloped. Hell even Optimos Prime is under-used in this movie.<br /><br />  Bay knows how to do very few things. Such as...blowing stuff up, making a loud movie and smothering us with patriotism and romance. The first movie had all that, but it was executed better and the movie was fresh. This one could have just used a lot more development. I mean people complained that Terminator: Salvation was all action and no brains but I think that applies to this film a lot more. It has nice effects, the acting wasn't bad and there was some fun but it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. It has more battles and more action, yet it gets tiresome. While Bay's idea of good humor is not 1 but 3 scenes that have to do with either dogs humping or a little transformer humping Megan Fox's leg.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I actually really enjoyed the first installment of this franchise.  I never got into the cartoon as a kid and, to be honest, I only ever owned ONE of the action figures (a T-Rex) and my father broke it accidentally and never replaced it, but I didn't really care.  No, I only went to see the film because my best friend at the time was insistent that we go, and so we did, and I was truly entertained.  Yes, it had many faults (the graphics, while amazing, were a little bulky and the film was overly long) but it was a great way to waste a day, that's for sure.<br /><br />This one, is just a wasted day; period.<br /><br />Hollywood, popcorn munching, big-budget, explosion filled, mind numbing spectacles have no business crossing the two-hour mark; ever.  Okay, so some of them have, and some of them warrant that (I still love `Armageddon') but for the most part, two-hours is pushing it.  There is only so much you can do with that kind of atmosphere, and if you ware out your welcome you diminish any affection one may have towards the film as a whole.  This film is roughly an hour too long.  In fact, once they reach the desert, it's pretty much a collage of repeated sequences that made me want to pick out my eye-balls.<br /><br />How many times can you have the same battle before the audience just walks away?<br /><br />I liked the college part of the story, even if the parents were gimmicky caricatures (the mother was the funniest part of the whole film though, and it should be mentioned that she is also the most memorable).  I liked the faux tension between Sam and Mikaela, even if you don't really care about them as characters (yes, she is hot and he is charming, but really, who cares?).  I liked the base storyline, even though after a while things got confusing and rather stupid and just completely fell apart in the end.  To make a long story short, it opened with promise (a lot of promise) but it just went downhill, fast.<br /><br />I'm one of those rare guys who likes Shia LaBeouf.  I don't like the fact that he is dating the ubber hot and superiorly talented Carey Mulligan (marry me Jenny) but whatever.  At least he is talented (who would have ever guessed that?) and so I really hope that he has a big career after this phase in his life is over.  I mean, it's a big thing for a star this young to get a franchise like Transformers, because it paves the way for him to make something of himself.  He is a household name now because of this movie, but I think he has more in store than this drivel.<br /><br />Oh, and can I just say that this films racial stereotypes (those ghetto robots) are insulting.  I was blown away that they would GO there with this film.<br /><br />I'd watch the first half of the film and then shut of down before it ruins itself.  Isabel Lucas is extremely hot here and steals Fox's thunder a bit (although she's only in the first part of the film, so BOO) and Shia keeps the charm coming full throttle in order to keep you somewhat interested.  The graphics are the same as before, except there is more of them this go around, and that proves to be a blessing and a malediction.  The forest fight sequence is great; everything in the desert is not.<br /><br />Seriously, turn this off about half way through and you'll be satisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I like the transformers concept just because I think about how cool it would be if I were a ten-story high transformer with enough firepower for an entire WWII army--I could roll into Washington, D.C., looking big and mean and ugly--and maybe scare the entire U.S. congress into jumping into the Potomac River. :-) Maybe then we'd get a quality legislature who works for us instead of the special interests.<br /><br />Well, of course that's a techno-fantasy of Star Trek proportions, but I can dream.<br /><br />Anyway, the amazing transformer sequences are the strong point here and they're enjoyable despite the somewhat choppy filming which sometimes makes it hard to tell exactly what you're seeing. I enjoyed the action (I'm easily entertained when it comes to movies with lots of gratuitous sex and violence), but don't expect much in the way of nuanced acting. The story line here, however, is stronger than in the first movie and the transformers themselves even more impressive, and with some very human personality quirks in some cases. Fans of C3PO and R2D2 will see that famous pair of robot friends reprised here in the two goofy, smaller transformers.<br /><br />For me this was a four star movie just for the entertainment value. For someone with more movie acumen than me it might be more like a three-star. Just my perhaps uninformed opinion. Also the John Turturro line where he says, "Now in position...below enemy scrotum," was hilarious. :-)</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>- The special effects are exciting and jaw-dropping.<br /><br />- The robot fighting scenes are much easier to see than those of the previous movie. Here, I can clearly see who is fighting against whom. Or who is being beaten up.<br /><br />- The action is non-stop.<br /><br />- The picture is colorful.<br /><br />- Meegan Fox is irresistibly sexy.<br /><br />- It has less funny scenes than the first movie.<br /><br />I believe it's one of the best action movies of 2009. I own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>I found the film 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' to be one of those rare films where the sequel is equal to, if not better than the original. The special effects are mind-boggling, the action non-stop, the cast strong and Megan Fox irresistible. I also enjoyed the intermittent comedic sequences that added a nice change of pace. Sam's Mom wandering around campus with the "tainted" brownies was classic. There are numerous reviews that lament over a weak plot but I disagree completely with such a suggestion. I loved the way they amalgamated various aspects of New Age beliefs with a Christian apocalyptic vision, replacing demonic entities with intergalactic Decepticons descending upon the Earth to finish an ages old battle on the Giza plateau. Indeed a glorious, mechanized Armageddon!<br /><br />Definitely lots of fun here. The one thing I question about 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is the language and sexual references liberally sprinkled throughout the film. While this is a film that can be enjoyed by movie fans of all ages there seems to be a few scenes here and there that may not be appropriate for some of the younger viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I wasn't a big fan of the first film so, I decided to watch it again before viewing this overblown sequel. I actually liked the first film more this time around, even though I still think it is way too long for the material at hand. The second film 'Transformers - Revenge Of The Fallen' takes everything good about the first film and just throws in away! The film is longer with bigger FX, but the FX are so fast that it's really hard to appreciate them. The film is also plagued with ridiculous humor that is so corny I rolled my eyes so much I thought they might fall out of their sockets! The parents in particular are just awful and serve no purpose at all, except to add some humor (if you can call it that?), but end up being distracting and silly. Megan Fox's roll has been reduced to shameful sexy eye candy(for a kiddie film)and Shia has reached an all time low here.<br /><br />If you like films with no character development and tedious storylines, then this might be for you. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I hope it is the end to the series.Extremely disappointing film that isn't any fun at all.</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>Here's how the film goes<br /><br />recist sterotypes<br />robot farts<br />dog humps a soft toy<br />robit farts<br />robot crys<br />dog humps some more<br />ridiculous plot<br />sexist stereotyes<br />Robot humps megan fox's leg<br />robot farts<br />racist stereotypes<br />Robot says he is too old for this crap and farts<br />Robot has big metal testicles<br />robot farts<br />Ebonics<br />the end<br /><br />Michael Bay is the worst ever</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Transformers Two is one of the worst sequels in recent memory and remains as one of the worst pictures I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.Spielberg,Bay and company should be ashamed of this overly complicated,long and generally shoddy product they hoisted on an eagerly awaiting public.The first movie in this franchise was superb;the right amount of action with a very credible plot and great special effects.This movie takes all that that was built on and essentially trashes it.<br />Shia Lebeouf returns as Sam,as his friend Optimus Prime continues his fight to eliminate the Decpeticon threat throughout the world(and in space).Sam discovers a piece of the Allspark in his house which melts through the floor to bring to life all the appliances in his house,wreaking alot of unwanted havoc.Optimus approaches Sam saying that the Decepticons are amassing again and the time has come that he needs his help.Sam,incredulously considering all that has past in the first movie,refuses to help!!He's off to college and can't be bothered??? Sam,in keeping with all that has gone on,should have been right there,no questions.This illogical plot thread creates a rift from which the movie never recovers.<br />Sam goes to college but the inevitable conflict follows him,much to his chagrin(what did he really expect?).In fact he does everything to avoid getting involved.His roommates we discover even run an internet alien conspiracy theory site;how convenient!The fight eventually engulfs Sam and his girlfriend who have no choice but to join Optimus and company in their fight against the Decepticons.Their journey goes worldwide and Megatron is(of course) released and in turn releases the Fallen,the evil head of the Decepticons.In the end it is a dual to the death and just as we think Optimus and Sam are no more a material called the Matrix comes into the picture and with the help of ancient Primes Sam is sent back to bring Optimus back to life to finally defeat the evil horde.<br />This is just a tip of the iceberg breakdown of the plot,because it is a long,ponderous and over complicated thing that I could never do justice to anyway;nor is it WORTH repeating or trying to do justice to(may I recommend a look at [...],to see just how complicated it really is).One autobot we are intro'd to is a souped up ice cream truck which turns into two "homeys" at will who constantly argue over nothing and are there for supposed "comic relief" but offer nothing but annoyance.<br />At 143 minutes this special effects driven leviathan slowly weaves its' way along and doesn't really get moving until the last 20 minutes or so,and by then everything is anti-climactic and you are just wishing the whole mess a speedy and quick ending.<br />This two DVD set contains featurettes,deleted and alternate scenes and a music video by Linkin Park.The film has been transferred beautifully and the sound as A-1.However it is like trying to dress up a corpse;there is no life here so why bother.<br />This movie goes on my all time Turkey list for two reasons:what the film IS and for what it SHOULD have been.Unless the next one can dig itself out from under this massive failure somehow,this might have essentially killed the franchise in just two pictures.The producers lost sight of the ball big time and the proof is painfully here for all to see.But I recommend you save your money and DON'T!</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>The first movie was arguably the one of the best science fiction fantasy  movies of 2007. Everything clicked in the first one. I thought the follow up would be just as good and was I ever wrong.<br />Revenge of the Fallen was just that a character called the Fallen is introduced as Megatron's master & decides now is the time to take over.<br />They missed the target on this one. Too much toilet, bathroom and pointless vulgar language and humor to start off..characters that were just plain stupid...Autobots that had no name and had ghetto humor.Robots that were not even part of the TV series...boy what went wrong here (everything basically)...<br />I cant believe just how bad this was..Fallen is the key word...Fallen from the great heights from the first picture to this lousy sequel.<br />I have no idea what made Michael Bay decide to go for bathroom humor, closeups of a man's fatty butt, a character walking around with his pants down , endless scenes of Megan Fox' boobie cleavage, and a pointless "I love you" subplot that went nowhere at all. I mean really, if you love someone tell them - don't play the battle of wills. Is that how Bay sees relationships - who gives in to who ? Do you wait until someone dies until you say 'I love you I need you' and endless pour your heart out dribble ? Bleck !!<br />This was also overlong running at 2 1/2 hours with endless scenes of the cast running around Egypt looking for signs to find the Matrix of Leadership (which in the cartoon Optimus already has this in his chest) I was waiting for a Transformer Mummy to come out. Take the worst out of the Mummy Series and National Treasure & National Lampoon them with robots and this is what you get..<br />The action was okay - good, but explosions , SPFX , more robots with 'cool' (uncool) dialog do not replace a movie filled with holes, lousy toilet humor and just utter tedium in Egypt....<br />On top of that Rainn Wilsons parents were everything out of a nightmare. What kind of parents are these two ? Who came up with their asinine lines. The mother was just horrible with her dialog. And they kept popping up out of nowhere as did characters - just popping up out of nowhere, half the time I was asking where did this person come from...this made me want to watch the cartoon which at least were classier than this and had a more serious tone than this..<br />As much as I like Transformers & being a fan for over 2 decades this movie was a car wreck..this would make a great Rifftrax or Cinematic Titanic title (for those who are MST3K fans)<br />It really was that bad, and yet, you really want to root for Optimus Prime, you want to like him, but the film wont let you. Or you will like Prime but nothing else.<br />I know Transformers 3 is in the works..I hope Michael Bay & company decide to re-watch the first one to see that formula.<br />For those that did like it and want to own it , the 2 disc is the way to go as it has all the bonus features. Ill be questioning your sanity however :-)</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>presently serving fish tacos . has anyone tried these ? are they pretty fair ? speaking of which , i saw a recent photo of SAMMY SOSA . i figure if SAMMY can achieve those wonderful results with that swell cream , perhaps i could use said cream to become invisible (i'll have to examine the monthly budget) . that might be cool , as i could observe our highly engaged and conscientious legislators (from both sides of the isle) continue to craft laws and ammend stuff to please and enlighten us all . i'd be able to do so under the radar (so as not to be a fuss) . a certain tomato salad themed restaurant here in FLORIDA is very good but a bit pricey . i think they'll probably reduce their prices because i'd wager they want the nation to be healthier . folks should charge more for pay television . it's a fount . if i was invisible , i could help those folks on panels and group discussions on 24 hour news programs disseminate the exciting and uplifting news with even greater aplomb . they could probably use the additional help .  you know , speed the plough .</p></br></body></html>

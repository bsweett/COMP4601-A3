Judged by that standard, few films are greater than "The Searchers,"  pieces of some of the greatest films ever made have their genesis in this John Ford masterpiece.<br /><br />The scene in "Star Wars" where Luke Skywalker returns home to find his aunt and uncle dead? Yep, that's from "The searchers," right down to a windswept Luke looking briefly away when the enormity of what happened hits him.<br /><br />The opening shot, framed by a doorway opening into the desert vastness and a woman walking out of it, has been incorporated into dozens of films, the latest being "Kill Bill, Volume 2."<br /><br />The story of a sociopathic bigot trying to rescue a young girl trapped with a bunch of savages? Hey, wasn't that the basic plot of "Taxi Driver"?<br /><br />In addition to being a cinematic touchpiece for generations of filmmakers, "The Searchers" stands on its own as a truly great film experience, probably most notable for its stunning visuals, John Wayne's greatest performance, and a slightly more nuanced approach to the "cowboys and Indians" conflict that marked the coming of the revisionist Western.<br /><br />If nothing else, "The Searchers" is a gorgeous film to look at, with some of the most well-known visuals in film history. The most famous images, of course, are of the opening and closing "doorway" shots, but the desert scenes have enduring grace and power. If Wayne is the star of this film, the desert is his co-star.<br /><br />Wayne's complex, powerful portrayal of Ethan not only defined his career, but also helped define a new kind of character that would soon become known as an "antihero." Before long, the antihero would redefine cinema in films like "Bonnie and Clyde," "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," and even "Raiders of the Lost Ark."<br /><br />Much has been written about the attitude towards native Americans in "The Searchers," but this much is pretty clear: it's a whole lot more nuanced than the Westerns of its day. The famous climactic scene in which Wayne's character picks up his niece (who he'd vowed to kill because she was living with Cherokees) and takes her home seems to be an admittance that his bigotry is wrong. When the door literally closes on Wayne's character in the movie's legendary closing shot, the message is pretty clear: he might have done the right thing by bringing his niece home, but his attitudes are no longer acceptable, and he is denied redemption.<br /><br />That's a pretty powerful anti-bigotry message by 1956 standards, and like so much else in "The Searchers," it, too, lived on.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>I watched this 1956 John Ford classic for the first time the night after watching the 10th aniversary of afi's 100 years 100 greatest movies show.<br />I have a runco front projector and a 106" drop down screen even an image stretched that much it looked amazing on Hd, so bright and colorful.<br />Ive seen older movies in HD via cable and through dish (voom when it was around) and they do not compare to a movie on hd dvd, i own about 30 Hd dvd titles so far and believe it or not this would rank as one of the best looking ones.<br />I believe older titles and silent films restored like this in amazing transfers and becoming available on dvd, hd dvd and blu ray are big reasons that there were 19 new slots on the afi list that did not make it last time and only three movies kept there original rankings.  Another example a beautiful movie like city lights jumps from 76 to 11 and Vertigo  from 61 to 9.<br />What can i say about a movie like this that hasn't already been said, i've read reviews from Ebert and interviews with Scorsese and found it interesting that Taxi driver was influenced a great deal by the Searchers.<br />Ethan pursues his niece Debbie, obsessed and determined to save her from the commanche indians.  In Taxi driver Travis Bickle also tries to save a young Jody Foster about the same age as Debbie from a pimp.  It is not certain either girl wants to be saved in both films, and the pimp in Scorsese's film played by Harvey Keitel wears an indian feather in his hat.<br />This is a great add to any collection and a great looking and sounding dvd for any time period.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>I think the Searchers is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Mainly because, faced with seeming insurmontable obstacles, Wayne keeps searching for his niece for years.  It is amazing how the years pass in the film, and you realize, what it must have taken for the character to keep trying, driving himself day after day.<br /><br />There are some cute moments in the movie, but John Wayne's passion to find his niece is just a classic piece of film making.<br /><br />I remember watching a special about the movie and was intrigued at how much work went into filming on location in Arizona.  Ford really was a motivator and a genius when it came to film, and this was one of his favorites from what I remember.<br /><br />If you like John Wayne movies, you just love this.  Natalie Wood does a great job as his niece grown up.<br /><br />I think it is a great lesson of life, however, the interest here is that in a time when murder and mayhem reigned in the Southwest, the passion of the time saw extremes in hatred on both sides of the racial divide.<br /><br />Finally, it is really just a great story and very well done movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Given the stature of this film, one would expect a better quality DVD.  I can only hope that one will soon be made available.  This is perhaps the greatest Western of all time.  Wayne turns in his most compelling performance as the lone wolf, Ethan, forced to confront an old Indian nemesis, Scar.  Ford sets Wayne against the backdrop of Monument Valley, as Ethan tracks down a teenage girl (Natalie Wood) who had been abducted by Scar.  The film can be a little uneven but it tells a very intriguing story.  Ford confronts racism and feelings of isolation, steering away for the most part from cliche images of the West.  Edward Buscombe has written a fine piece on &quot;The Searchers&quot; for BFI Film Classics which is well worth reading as it fills you in on the making of film, offering notes on Ford's epic vision.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>the cowboys stands along side the searchers,rio bravo,stagecoach,red river,and the shootest as proof that wayne was a very gifted actor. when his hands leave for a gold strike,mr.anderson(wayne) must take 11 school boys and turn them into cowboys to help him get his cattle to market. the trip is long, dangerous, and a learning time for all. wayne is very good as the rancher and he really shines whenever he is talking(yelling) at the boys. there is a feel here that he really thinks of the boys as sons and the boys hold there own with wayne which must have been tough to do. as for those who feel that the message of the movie is revenge,maybe they have missed the point,it's about pride ,honor,following through with your word,and most of all it's about learning that being a man of honor isn't easy but it is the only way to live your life.<br /><br />  i watch westerns with my young sons and because it does have some violent content(not really bad,but there are two  shocking deaths)i'll wait to show them this one,but it is very good and as always wayne is the rock that holds it all together.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Monument Valley never looked as breathtakingly beautiful as it does in this exquisite, richly faceted Western, perhaps the most accomplished film in John Ford's oeuvre. Wayne gives the performance of a lifetime as the obsessed, enigmatic Ethan, while young Natalie Wood is indelible in a brief role as Debbie, the kidnapped girl caught between worlds. Ford described his ambitious masterwork as a "psychological epic," and this gut-twisting, high-lonesome tale certainly grows more nuanced with each viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Now considered the greatest American Film, yes, greater than Citizen Kane, The Searchers was always a John Wayne-John Ford favorite, but lately the critics have chimed in. Ford records once again and for all time his actors in the backdrop of an unreal place, Monument Valley. The jutting rocks placed before the camera as if an Ansel Adams photograph excites the eye.  There's much to be said for a good shoot site.  This one is the best of all time.  The framed shots from within The Edwards cabin, a photo of Wayne coming and going as the lonely American without connection to his family, a beautiful allegory in cinema.<br /><br />Made in 1955 from a book by Alan Le May, essentially this is a story of tribal hatred.  The white settlers and the Comanche battle it out for the land and the women. The racial insanity, still potent in the mid-50's after two hundred years of murderous strife has hit the wall.  Ethan as played by Wayne, the stereotypical Ford, Western hero, except for one flaw: Ethan is a racist.  The Indian raid on his family, the rape of his niece and the kidnapping of Debbie Edwards, played by Natalie Wood as an adult (her younger sister played the child) send Ethan on a trek of revenge. Young Martin Pawley played by Jeffrey Hunter searches for Debbie also, but only to keep his adopted uncle from murdering her.  Ethan wants do an honor killing because the Comanche Chief, Sky will have bedded her by the time she's a woman.  The search goes on episodically all over the Southwest for five years and Debbie is indeed a woman in Sky's tepee.<br /><br />The reuniting of lovers and the return of Debbie to a tranquil America of love and tolerance envelopes all but one in the curious ending.  Only Ethan is alone in the doorway with the rock sculptures of Monument Valley.<br /><br />One last note: I know cosmetics were important to 1950's sensibilities.  The false eyelashes and ruby red lips of Natalie Wood playing a white- woman turned Comanche and her tight fitting Indian dress, distracted from an otherwise well researched make-up and costuming.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>THE SEARCHERS is perhaps John Ford's best Western and perhaps his best film. John Wayne's obsessive Ethan Edwards is one of his best roles. John Wayne is Ethan Edwards playing the character and embellishing him with just enough Wayne-isms to set this returning ex-Confederate apart from the rest of the community. Wayne's Ethan Edwards is characterized by an intense sense of stoicism and strong individuality required of this enigmatic and complex man. Upon his return from the war the Comanches destroy what family he has and it is unclear if Wayne is acting out his hatred of the Indians or simply avenging his loss as he begins his quest to rescue his niece, Debbie. Wayne is accompanied by his half breed nephew Martin, portrayed by effectively by Jeffrey Hunter, on his quest which continually reveals Wayne's contempt for the Indians. The quest and anticipation of what Wayne will do when and if they find Debbie is an emotional journey for the characters and viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>'The Searchers' is by no means a perfect movie but, at the same time, it IS a great movie.  It is fascinating that John Wayne was at his best when he stepped out of his classic 'good guy' image.  This is true of all his truly great movies whether it be 'The Searchers', 'True Grit', or his almost perfect, 'The Shootist.'  Wayne was an actor acutely concerned about his image and I would love to know how he personally felt about roles in which he played flawed, complex characters.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a compilation of historical information and novelistic interpretation.  Cynthia Parker was actually kidnapped by the Comanche and was only 'liberated' after 24 years.  She had married and gave birth to Quanah Parker who became the Comanche's greatest warchief.  This is only the bare bones of stories played out multiple times in the land that would become America.  Settlers on the frontier are the victims of lightening raids by hostile war parties.  All seems to be well when suddenly someone is crashing in your door.  Families were slowly tortured and murdered...all to the amusement of the warriors.  Children and women were sometimes taken captive.  The children were oftentimes raised as their own by the tribe.  Women captured were, generally speaking, regarded as the mutual property of the war party, and, in the vast majority of cases, the victims of mass rape.  On arriving at the village, the raped women became the sole property of the capturing warrior and, again in most cases, was used as a slave for both work and sex.<br /><br />This is the context of the attitudes that the John Wayne character expresses so well.  People living on the frontier lived in almost constant horrific fear...and hatred.  For those who actually visit the scenes of the torture, rape and murder of friends and relatives the hatred could become consuming...as it nearly consumes Wayne's character.  This is perhaps difficult to understand in these politically correct times but, let me suggest that those who condemn these attitudes search their own hearts, as well.  For us, these things are primarily historical and bear no more relationship to us than, let's say, stories of a massacre in far off Africa or Asia, 500 years ago.  At one time, however, the danger was personal and, you, me and virtually everyone else, had we lived under the danger of a scalping knife, would have felt very differently.<br /><br />This is not to justify the destruction of the native americans but it is to place it in a personal context, without which the destruction seems not only wrong but nonsensical.  The Wayne character is idiosyncratic and prejudiced.  He has survived a long war and refused to sign the Yankee 'Loyalty Oath'.  He returns home three years after the War and, at one point, gives the child Debbie a military decoration...probably Maximillian/Mexican...as a bauble, so we suspect that Wayne didn't give up the fight in 1865 but only moved it to Mexico.  He also knows a lot about the Plains Indians and even speaks Comanche....but it doesn't make him love them.<br /><br />Wayne's brother's family is slaughtered by the Comanche...and he views the horrific scene with grim hatred.  Two girls...one in her late teens and the other, Debbie, a child...have been carried off by the war party.  Wayne and others pursue.  Wayne, by himself, discovers the body of the older girl...raped and mutilated...and covers her with his Confederate great coat and 'I buried her with my own hands', he tells the others in his grim but harrowing grief.<br /><br />The search for little Debbie goes on literally for years and, when Wayne discovers that she has 'been with a buck', and been thereby contaminated, his search becomes that of a strange vengeance.  Debbie has been turned into one of the hated Comanche and must die.  On attacking the village in which Debbie is kept, Wayne, true to himself, scalps 'Scar' the chief who is keeping Debbie as a wife.  The last scenes of the movie are of both Debbie's and Wayne's redemption.  A great movie.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Probably the Duke's greatest film.  A large scale epic of a quest by Ford with Wayne tracking his lost niece -- after Indians raid her home and kill her family.  Aided by Jeffrey Hunter, this a truly monumental motion picture and not simply one of the greatest westerns ever made.  Wayne's character is a man who truly loses everything -- best exemplified by the final scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I've already seen this under-rated John Wayne Western classic. Unjustly maligned at the time of its release because of its theme, "boys become men though a violent rite of passage" (echoes of Vietnam & Iraq) now can be placed alongside Wayne's other great films like "The Searchers" & "The Shootist".  I am not normally a fan of Westerns or of the Duke because of his conservative politics but I have to admit this is one gem in Duke's crown. Roscoe Lee Browne, Bruce Dern (at his most villainous) and Colleen Dewhurst in a brief, but amusing turn as a madam are excellent.  Mark Rydell shines in his first directorial effort at a Western. The visuals and sound in HD or Blu-ray (I have both but am ordering HD) is superb. Well I have the HD DVD version and the visuals are superb, do recommend you get this version since it is way cheaper than the Blu-Ray which is from the same master. One of the Duke's last great Westerns (along with "The Shootist").</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>This movie shines when telling the story of a rancher who brings some young kids just learning about life on a cattle run. John Wayne is at his toughest and kindest as he teaches lessons to the youth and has a deadly encounter. Bruce Dern as the [...] conveys meanness in a powerful way. Great simple lines between Wayne and Dern. A very touching story with good messages. Nicely filmed. A unique John Wayne movie, one of his best.

Divorce it from the genre it ranks as one of cinema's greatest achievement.  Director John Ford advanced the genre with "Stagecoach" and the calvary trilogy but he raises the stakes even further here.  The title of the film has multiple meanings.  On the surface it refers to the 5 year trek to find young Debbie who was taken by the Comanche after the slaughter of her family.  It could also refer to John Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, a man who served in the Confederacy during the Civil War who wandered for three years before returning to his family.  His search for young Debbie raises questions.  Does Debbie represent family to him or is she now part of the hated Comanche?  One of the chillier images I have from the film is Edwards nonchalantly shooting out the eyes of a dead Comanche.  The motivation for this is Edwards' knowledge that the Comanche believes he'll wander in the afterlife blindly without his eyes.  Wayne's performance of this complex character is subtle yet towering.  Jeffrey Hunter more than holds his own as Martin Pauley, Debbie's adopted brother who forms an uneasy alliance with Edwards to find her.  There's nothing showy about Hunter's work here but it's no less impressive than his young method actor contemporaries(Brando, Dean, etc.).  Great supporting cast on hand(Ward Bond, Vera Miles, etc.).  Vivid storytelling and Ford has never utilized his beloved Monument Valley to better effect.  When people say this essential viewing believe it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>The Searchers is one of the best movies Ford and Wayne made. Cinematically, it is a beautiful show (and you'll see homages to it everywhere, including Star Wars). It is one of Wayne's darker roles, and one he plays well. It's not John Wayne on the screen, it's more like he was able to find the character. Jefferey Hunter and Ward Bond do a wonderful job. My only fault with the movie is that Ford wraps it up too easily. He didn't explore the dark character Wayne played enough. But the years of searching and vengence make the trip worthwhile, even if it does end a little too 'neatly.' <p>The dvd is a bit of a dissapointment. One side is a full-screen version, and if you flip it over you can watch the wide-screen version. As with most dvds where the director and stars are dead, there is no commentary. (And I can't help but think of how great it would be to hear Ford and Wayne talk about this movie). There are some production notes that are interesting. There are 4 short 'Warner Bros. Presents' Shorts, two on one side, two on the other. They don't even touch the movie. It is a shame that there is no documentary. Ford shot seven reels of a 'Making Of', one of the first of its kind. If that had been added to this dvd, then this would be a spectacular dvd. As it is, it's still a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>The Searchers tells the story of Ethan Edwards's five-year search for his kidnapped niece. John Wayne gives a great performance (many people argue its his best) as Ethan Edwards, a tough, proud Civil War veteran who refused to give up and who is forced to spend years of his life searching for his niece, Debbie. The journey, mostly set in the beautiful Monument Valley of Southern Utah, is truly a quest of epic proportions.<br /><br />The story is intriguing, the plot fast-moving and unpredictable, and the action exciting. Wayne's performance as Edwards shows him in a darker, more unpredictable role than many of his other films, and that sun-baked, battle-hardened face covered with stubble is a visage that, in many ways, epitomizes the rough character of the American West.<br /><br />The movie contains a number of stereotypes, from European settlers to Comanche Indians, that would not be considered politically correct today. Despite this, however, this is a fine film by director John Ford, one that captivates from beginning to end. Every list of the greatest Westerns of all time should include "The Searchers."<br /><br />It's great to see a classic film like this one get an excellent re-release.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>There are moments in this film that are just about as perfect as anything as you will find in cinema, moments that display John Ford functioning at his highest level as a filmmaker.  For instance, there is a precious moment in which a woman is affectionately stroking the coat of her brother-in-law, who has just turned up after a long absence.  She is unaware that someone else, played by Ward Bond, can and at first does see her.  But the moment is far too personal, and Bond resolutely averts his eyes and refuses to see what ought not to be seen by anyone.  Another such instance is the final shot of the film (which I can't describe in detail without giving away the plot).  As the family retreats into the house, another character is framed outside the house (as if to exclude him), isolated from the family.  It is a heartbreaking shot.  The shot was also a homage to the late Harry Carey, in that the character in the frame holds his arm across his chest to hold the top of his opposite arm above the elbow, a gesture that anyone from that time period would associate with Carey.<p>This great John Ford film comes very close to being the greatest Western ever made.  In fact, with two slight alterations, it almost certainly would have been.  For some reason, Ford in some of his films suffered from unaccountable lapses in casting.  In this one, in the crucial role of Martin Pawley, he cast Jeffrey Hunter.  In many ways, Hunter mars the film with his often-grating performance.  One can only lament what the film could have been with someone like Montgomery Cliff in the same role.  The other odd decision was the elevation of Ken Curtis's role as Vera Miles other suitor.  Curtis, a former big band crooner who was later best known as "Festus" on GUNSMOKE, has several scenes that tend to bring down the overall quality of the film, especially a fight scene at a wedding with Jeffrey Hunter.<p>But these are aberrations in what is otherwise a masterpiece of the highest order.  I am not a big John Wayne fan, but Wayne was not just never better than he was in this film:  it is impossible to imagine anyone playing the central role of Ethan Edwards better than Wayne does.  He brings a grimness and tenacity and monomania that gives the movie much of its force and tension.  And although Hunter and Curtis both mar the film, most of the cast is spectacular.  Sometimes it seems as if Ward Bond were in every other film made in the thirties, forties, and fifties, but he was never better than he was in the role of Reverend Captain Samuel Johnson Clayton, both minister and police depending upon the need at the time.  And Hank Worden is memorable as "Old Mose," the more than a little crazed old fool who provides some of the films more memorable moments.  For instance, with the Rangers entrenched on one side of a river, bracing to meet an onrushing group of Indians, Mose suddenly shouts out, "Oh Lord, for what we are about to receive, we thank thee."  <p>They key to the film, however, apart from Ford, lies in the performance of John Wayne.  This is not the simplistic Indian killer or fighter you see in most of Wayne's films.  In this one, he is a man who has seen and suffered too much.  Ironically, he is chasing a rogue Indian chief named Scar, so-called because of a scar running down the side of his face.  But Ethan is far more scarred than the Indian is.  And as his hunt for Debbie, who has been abducted by Indians, turns from weeks into months into years, he correspondingly becomes more and more obsessed, to the point of near insanity.  Indeed, much of the tension of the last part of the film comes from the distrust of Ethan's sanity on the part of Martin (Jeffrey Hunter).  The scene where Ethan finally determines the fate of Debbie is one of the great moments in cinema.<p>This is just a great film by one of the great masters of the American cinema with the greatest performance by one of our most famous stars.  If that isn't enough to make someone unfamiliar with this film to see it, I don't know what would be.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>I can't agree with calling "The Searchers" an iliadic western.

DANCES WITH WOLVES, THE OUTLAW JOSIE WALES, UNFORGIVEN, JEREMIAH JOHNSON, and OPEN RANGE are just a few westerns that have 'borrowed' from it, but THE SEARCHERS' impact transcends the genre, itself; STAR WARS, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, THE LAST SAMURAI, even THE LORD OF THE RINGS have elements that can be traced back to Ford's 1956 'intimate' epic. When you add the fact that THE SEARCHERS also contains John Wayne's greatest performance to the film's merits, it becomes easy to see why it is on the short list of the greatest motion pictures ever made.<p>The plot is deceptively simple; after a Comanche raiding party massacres a family, taking the youngest daughter prisoner, her uncle, Ethan Edwards (Wayne), and adopted brother, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), begin a long quest to try and rescue her. Over the course of years, a rich tapestry of characters and events unfold, as the nature of the pair's motives are revealed, and bigoted, bitter Edwards emerges as a twisted man bent on killing the 'tainted' white girl. Only Pawley's love of his 'sister' and determination to protect her stands in his way, making the film's climax, and Wayne's portrayal of Edwards, an unforgettable experience.<p>With all of Ford's unique 'touches' clearly in evidence (the doorways 'framing' the film's opening and conclusion, with a cave opening serving the same function at the film's climax; the extensive use of Monument Valley; and the nearly lurid palette of color highlighting key moments) and his reliance on his 'stock' company of players (Wayne, Ward Bond, John Qualen, Olive Carey, Harry Carey, Jr, Hank Worden, and Ken Curtis), the film marks the emergence of the 'mature' Ford, no longer deifying the innocence of the era, but dealing with it in human terms, where 'white men' were as capable of savagery as Indians, frequently with less justification.<p>Featuring 18-year old Natalie Wood in one of her first 'adult' roles, the sparkling Vera Miles as Pawley's love interest, Wayne's son Patrick in comic relief, and the harmonies of the Sons of the Pioneers accenting Max Steiner's rich score, THE SEARCHERS is a timeless movie experience that becomes richer with each viewing.<p>It is truly a masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I had never watched "The Cowboys" before because, when it first came out, the concept of John Wayne leading a bunch of kids on a cattle drive didn't appeal to me.  However, the awareness that this was one of 30 some John Wayne movies I hadn't seen led me to watch it last night.  I was impressed.  For one thing, I could tell from the beginning that this was a major production for its' day.  The cinematography was impressive and the location and sets were well done too.  The case for why a school room-full of kids were chosen for the job was credibly made and the journey begins.  There's a fair amount of action and entertainment along the way.  John Wayne gives a good performance as the cattleman who comes to respect his trailhands.  There is some suspenseful conflict with some bad guys and something that rarely happens in a John Wayne film occurs.  I won't say what it was but I could only think of "The Shootist" and, in an indirect way, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" as the other times it occurred after "The Alamo".<br /><br />The kids give a credible performance and so does Roscoe Lee Brown.  Interestingly, there was a bit actor with the last name Canutt who showed up on the credits (as one of the bad guys).  Could it the Duke found work for a relative of his old sparring partner Yakima Canutt?  Collen Dewhurst is featured but she's over-billed for her gratuitous part.  This is not a great movie but it turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>John Ford was a master craftsman of the American cinema. Though he dabbled in melodrama and action during his directorial career, his everlasting contribution to the movies remains in those galvanic distillations of the old west put forth by an unparalleled series of legendary films. "The Searchers" ranks among his most finely wrought and meticulously hand crafted projects.  Indeed it seems to be the film in which the culmination of Ford's own commitment to the power, beauty and frailty of the western frontier tragically come together in a revisionist perspective that exposes both its grandeur and its flaws. The film stars the iconic John Wayne as Ethan Edwards -  a strangely majestic antihero who vows bloody revenge after his cousin and family are slaughtered by marauding Comanches. But Ethan's search for his surviving niece (Natalie Wood) becomes a sinister and all-consuming obsession when he learns that she - having been abducted while still a child - has now adopted the ways of her captors and, at least in Ethan's mind, has become one of them.  The film tackles racism in the form of Ethan's distrust of one time family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is part Cherokee and the sweep and spectacle of Death Valley has never been quite so poignantly captured on film.<br />THE TRANSFER: While Warner Home Video has made "The Searchers" available in anamorphic widescreen in a print that is light years ahead of anything the film has looked like before for the home film enthusiast, compared to more current DVD releases, the visual splendor of the transfer falls short of expectations. Though colors are rich there's something of a muddiness and lack of balance to them in many of the indoor scenes. Also, several scenes appear to be suffering slightly from color shrinkage, creating a slightly out of focus image quality that is distracting. Age related artifacts are present but do not distract so much as the digital anomalies of pixelization and edge enhancement which greatly plague the background information in most of the long shots. A slight shimmering is inherent in all of the scenes. Black and contrast levels can be solid at times, while sometimes appearing slightly pasty. Ditto for the unnatural flesh tones which are either overly pink or a ruddy orange. The audio has been remastered and delivers a nice expansive presentation which is in keeping with the vintage of the original sound elements.<br />EXTRAS: Not this time around. Sadly, this film deserves a documentary.<br />BOTTOM LINE: "The Searchers" is a masterful western, on par with "Stagecoach" and "High Noon". Definitely one to add to your film library.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film, directed by the legendary John Ford, and starring John Wayne in the leading role is a western that has achieved mythic proportions. Touted as one of the greatest westerns ever filmed, it is, I will grant you, an entertaining film. In it, John Wayne plays the anti-hero, Ethan Edwards, an ex-confederate soldier, who goes to Texas in 1868 to visit his brother and his family on their ranch in Texas. While visiting, a report of marauding Indians in adjacent land draws out the Texas Rangers and Ethan, who joins them. When they discover that a decoy has been used to lure them away from the settlement, they hurry back, only to find that Ethan's family was masacred and his two nieces gone, taken captive by Comanche Indians.<p>Ethan goes to the rescue, joined by Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a friend of the family who is himself part Indian. After a while, they discover that only the younger niece, Debbie, has survived. Their quest to bring Debbie back, or so Martin thinks, takes place over a period of five years. At some point along the way, Ethan's relentless quest for Debbie seems to undergo a transition from rescue mission to execution squad in the belief that it is better to be dead than to have "gone Injun". <p>The film suffers somewhat from revisionist history and its own stereotypic portrayal of Indians. They are portrayed as either savages or buffoons fit only to be the butt of jokes. Moreover, the character of Ethan is an enigma, as he changes from heartbroken uncle to death squad killer in his relentless search for his surviving niece. Ethan embodies hatred and racism, concepts that are tantalizingly laid out but never fully examined or explored, which is why Ethan remains an enigma. <p>Debbie, played as a child by Lana Wood and as a teenager by Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, is a symbol around which Ethan's character gets its raison d'etre. It is she who gives him the will to go on, whether it be for the right or wrong reasons is another issue. Natalie Wood is lovely as the older Debbie, though the makeup has to go, as it serves to take away from the rusticity of the film and jerk the viewer back to Hollywood. This was typical of films in those days. No matter what the situation, the women were always in full makeup.<p>Still, notwithstanding some of the film's political incorrectness and incongruent production values, it is still an entertaining film and about as good as westerns get. John Wayne is memorable as Ethan Edwards. Handsome Jeffrey Hunter gives an excellent performance as Martin Pawley. Ward Bond, as captain of the Texas Rangers, is terrific. The rest of the supporting cast give performances that vary in quality. Still, this film remains the quintessential western flick and one worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Ethan Edwards is one of the screen's most memorable and complex characterizations.  His racism, impassioned rage, cold brutality, rugged individualism, and indestructible tenacity coexist with qualities of tenderness and affection, penetrating insight and principled high-mindedness.  Yet much of him remains inscrutable, testimony to the mysteries of human identity itself.  In many respects, Marty (Jeff Hunter) is the nominal &quot;hero,&quot; someone who strikes a balance between the individual and social world, frontier and domestic realm, and who sees beyond skin color and blood to the spiritual bond that  unites all human beings.  But there's no way John Wayne's tortured character--driven by lost opportunities in the past and vengeful priorities in the present--can be challenged.  He shoots out the eyes of dead Indians to insure their spirits will never be admitted to the happy hunting grounds, but like Oedipus and Lear it is his own blindness that denies him peace.  His epiphany is all the more powerful due to its unexpectedness.<p>Even were the rest of the film prosaic, &quot;The Searchers&quot; would rank among the best of American cinema.  But John Ford's storytelling magic is also on display at its best, creating an epic narrative that conveys the magnitude of space and the passing of time with equal verisimilitude.  Curiously, &quot;Shane&quot; commands a considerably higher price than &quot;The Searchers.&quot;  I'd argue that &quot;Shane,&quot; a much heralded film at the time of its release, has lost stature and cinematic interest, whereas exactly the opposite is true of &quot;The Searchers.&quot;  As for print quality, the restored DVD version is far from perfect but at least 50% better than earlier VHS editions.  That's good enough in the case of this masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>The Searchers  DVD<br /><br />This is John Wayne( the Duke) at his best in a John Ford film about a man whose niece ( Natalie Wood) was capture by the Comanch.  It is based on the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585470805">The Searchers</a>, which I have not read.<br /><br />It , also , stars Ward Bond as a feisty preacher and head of the local Rangers.  A couple of side comments.<br /><br />First, they should have paid attention to the dog.<br /><br />  Second, do you really think the Indians were stupid enough to identify their chiefs with that elaborate headdress?  The last army I can think of that did that ( identify their leaders ) was the British in the American Revolutionary War and they learned not to do that around American Sharpshooters<br /><br />Third, did you know that Texas hated the Indians so bad that they killed or drove out every last one of them?  There are no Indian Reservations in Texas.<br /><br />I thought I was in Love with Nartalie Wood when I was growing up.  Ain't she special?<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of the Classic western, John Wayne , and  Natalie wood.<br /><br />Gunner  February 2,008</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>The Seachers is a story about a racist, ex-Confederate soldier seeking his neice, a girl captured by Comanches.  The problem is that the longer it takes the more likely she will end up becoming one of them.  John Wayne's character of Ethan Edwards struggles over the five year seach between his hate of the Indians and his love of his family.  This movie has few good guys and no real bad guys.  Everybody seems to have a dark and bloody history behind their character.  The humor, used with a light touch, keeps the film from getting too depressing.<br /><br />Like in the Shootist, another film I enjoy, John Wayne is not playing a John Wayne character.  His character, in fact, seems to fall apart as the search continues.<br /><br />This Disc set had commentary by Peter Bogdanovich who does a great job, along with two features on the movie and Behind The Cameras segments from Warner Brothers Presents TV series.  It seems John Ford decided to film what was happening behind the cameras at the same time he was making the film.  This makes for great extras from a film product made before the age of DVDS.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>There has been much controversy over the racism depicted in this movie but I think that's part of what makes a compelling Western for its time period. John Wayne, I believe, portrayed one of his first anti-heroes ever (the other being "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence", another Ford classic) and he even named one of his sons after his character.  I've seen this classic on HD Net Movies and the transfer was fantastic--it's as if the movie was made yesterday and not in 1956!! Of course, too accolades from renowned directors such as Akira Kurosawa, David Lean (he resaw this film several times while making "Lawrence of Arabia"), Martin Scorsese, George Lucas (Star Wars owes quite a bit to this), Orson Welles and Curtis Hanson have helped to push this film into the American Film Institute of all time great Westerns. I guess one flaw I had wished Ford would've removed from this classic is the cornball humor involving Vera Miles, Jeffrey Hunter and an actor who's appeared in later "Gunsmoke" as episodes by the name of Curtis!!  Anyway outside of this quibble, the virtues of this film outweigh its flaws, Wayne himself turns in perhaps his greatest performance here.  Now the question is whether to purchase in HD DVD or Blu-ray (they are both basically similiar as far as I know from previous comparisons)?  To update I did purchase the HD DVD version and it's excellent and in answer to the previous reviewer there is a difference between Standard Def and High Def (HD DVD or Blu-ray) and if he has a 720p or 1080p but if not, he would not notice it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>A short review with three points:<br /><br />point #1 Jeffrey Hunter (Captain Pike in Star Trek's pilot, "The Cage") is fantastic in this. So is John Wayne...how did he not get nominated for an Oscar?<br /><br />point #2 Beautiful film to watch, too (thank you John Ford & Winton Hoch).<br /><br />point #3 All for under six bucks since this is the bare-bones DVD version.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>There is so much that is impressive in director John Ford's masterful 1956 classic that it is easy to get preoccupied with its glaring flaws. However, it's most important to recognize this film as a cinematic elegy of the old-fashioned western, a last-stand monument to Ford's unique oeuvre in movies before the revisionist filmmakers reshaped this type of film to meet contemporary tastes. Yet for its patently old-fashioned premise, the film contains unexpected darker tones which make the film fascinating. First, it depicts the unapologetic racism prevalent out in the frontier, and second, it has Ethan Edwards, a protagonist who not only shares these feelings but somehow redeems himself through his fortitude and often violent acts of self-defense. Through a vivid use of darkened doorways as a framing device, Ford and star John Wayne dexterously manage to elicit sympathy for the unsympathetic Edwards while maintaining his dying-breed status as a renegade outsider.<br /><br />Set in Texas a few years after the Civil War, the story focuses on Edwards' five-year long search for what remains of his family after a massacre by a band of Comanches headed by a chief named Scar. It becomes clear that youngest daughter Debbie may be alive, so Edwards and young tag-along, Martin Pawley, set off to find her. The motivations of the two couldn't be more different - Edwards was in love with Debbie's now-dead mother and seeks vengeance, which includes killing Debbie for being a converted Comanche; while Pawley wants to save Debbie and bring her back home. Frank S. Nugent's screenplay masterfully peels the layers off their journey with a series of revelations that lead to the dramatic final act. This is likely Wayne's finest two hours on film not because he plays his archetypal cowboy hero but because he shows a surprising audacity in exposing the dark soul of his character while slowly recognizing a begrudging humanism through his discoveries in the film.<br /><br />Everybody else is merely serviceable in comparison, including Jeffrey Hunter, who darts unsteadily between youthful arrogance and childish petulance as Pawley; Ward Bond as a bellowing reverend and Texas ranger; and a teenaged Natalie Wood, who has scant screen time late in the film as the grown Debbie. Vera Miles fares somewhat better as the headstrong Laurie, the girl Pawley leaves behind, though I find their romantic subplot rather distracting, especially toward the end with a lighthearted but lengthy wedding sequence. In fact, comic relief is used a little too liberally throughout the film with irritating performances from Hank Worden as the mentally defective Mose Harper and Ken Curtis as Laurie's anxious suitor Charlie. However, these are minor blemishes in the scheme of things, especially in light of Winton C. Hoch's magnificent cinematography. Never has the camera captured the beauty and drama of Monument Valley with more emotional fervor, even if it is masquerading as Texas. Special mention should also be given to Max Steiner's powerful musical score.<br /><br />Above all else, the film reflects the pinnacle of both Ford's and Wayne's careers, a point not lost on the elaborate two-disc 2006 DVD set. The first disc has a pristine print of the film along with a brief introduction by Wayne's son Patrick (who plays a small role in the film as a baby-faced Union soldier) and a terrifically insightful commentary track by director Peter Bogdanovich. He is not the only master director who reveres the film, as Curtis Hanson, Martin Scorsese, and John Milius offer their own praise on a new half-hour documentary on the second disc, "The Searchers: A New Appreciation". There are two other excellent featurettes included -  a 1998 behind-the-scenes documentary, "A Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers," and a vintage piece hosted by Gig Young called "Behind the Cameras", which has interviews with Hunter and Wood and an overview of Monument Valley. Don't expect a politically correct film, but it is difficult not to be mesmerized by the work of such masters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>John Ford is an inventive director. This is, without a doubt, true from every shot in 'the Searchers'. The details of the film are extraordinary, and you can see why Orson Welles was so enthralled by the man and his movies.<br /><br />John Wayne is very aptly cast in this - probably his best film.<br /><br />What grabs me the most is the epic style of the photography - the play of light and color - which must have been so exciting to see when the film came out.<br /><br />My perspective as a viewer in 2005 is what brings this one down to 4 stars for me (a personal decision). Although I see this film as a classic, even a masterpiece, I just cannot bare some of the racism that comes out at times.. I try to filter out this aspect - I mean all film is a product of its time and place - but my own personal perspective is very hard to shake. This does not take away from the very obvious brilliance that I do see in this film, however, and the genius of John Ford does shine through.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>The Cowboys is another great John Wayne movie, and after The Searchers, might be my favorite movie he has made. Wayne plays a tough rancher who is forced to use boys on a cattle drive. Wayne plays the role very well, tough and sweet, and has a great cast of boys supporting him (including A Martinez and Robert Carradine). Bruce Dern is the villain, and he does a great job in the role, but then this is the type of role Dern is best in. This is also one of the few instances where John Wayne is killed onscreen, and done so by Dern. The whole scene is one of the best I've seen John Wayne in. It's a great movie, unfortunately there aren't many extras on the dvd. There's a small featurette (less than 10 minutes), a few production notes, and bunch of trailers for John Wayne movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>"The Searchers" (1956) Anamorphic Widescreen DVD version is one of the best classic westerns ever made!

Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>This review is on the Ultimate Collector's Edition which came out this year.<br /><br />I guess it would be no surprise to anyone if I stated that The Searchers remains John Wayne's greatest film. Virtually everything about the movie remains timeless and its quality proves to be near perfect in almost every way. This movie should dispelled for all times, the fiction that John Wayne cannot act but himself. This movie was Wayne's greatest acting job. This was clearly shown early in the film when Wayne's character realized that his brother's ranch may be doom, the stricken look on that face remains priceless as it conveyed the horror of his mistake and despair behind the stoic behavior. Anyway, with so many previous reviews, I won't go further repeating what been written already.<br /><br />This DVD edition is definitely the ultimate edition as movie of this type could go. The movie image from this edition proves to be a superior improvement from the earlier edition that came out several years ago. The image proves to be clean, color vivid and it almost pristine. The soundtrack is clear, the audio is your basic mono but its also clear.<br /><br />The second disc contained all the extra documentaries. Both documentaries, "The Searcher: A Appreciation" and "Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers" proves to be insightful, interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />This edition also contains a copy of a 1956 Dell comic book on the movie. It been reduced in size but still readable. I supposed it useful to introduced the story without watching the movie. There is also a b/w booklet that contains many versions of the movie posters, and contemporary media hype on the movie. The other package contains collection of b/w back scene photos which is quite nice.<br /><br />There's also a coupon for a free The Searchers' movie reproduced poster. Unfortunately, the offer expired back several months ago.<br /><br />For people who don't want the extra material, there is the regular two disc edition which is bit cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, the ultimate edition sound bit overpriced but depending on how die-hard John Wayne fan you may be, the cost may be subjective.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>Another great movie with John Wayne.  The story of how a dozen or so schoolboys become men by leading a cattle drive.  John Wayne plays "Will Anderson" owner of a ranch and herd of cattle that need to be driven to market.  He has to hire local schoolboys because all the other men around his area are on "gold fever" absence.  This is a great story and excellent acting.  Roscoe Lee Browne is the cook during the cattledrive and is full of wisdom and mystery, Bruce Dern is the bad guy who "oozes" evil from the very beginning.  Robert Carradine is one of the cowboys so is A. Martinez.  This is one of the few movies in which John Wayne's character doesen't survive, but he sure does give the bad guy a big "whoopin".  I like this movie because you see an older John Wayne.  He is grizzled, tough yet tender, and shows the young cowboys how to be men by leading by example.  A great film that is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>This is John Wayne at his best.

Great acting by awesome actors and actresses, beautiful landscapes, are just a few of the highlights of this movie.  The ultimate collection has alot of great things.

Big John Wayne is the macho king, driven to find his niece, a captive of the Comanche. This film is a classic of its kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>It is 1868 in Texas. The Civil War is over but Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) continues to identify as a Confederate. He visits his family after a long time away, and is greeted by his niece Debbie. Soon thereafter, the family is massacred by the Comanches, and Debbie is kidnapped and raised as a Comanche. [It must be remembered that the kidnapping and upbringing of foreign children was practiced not only by certain Indian tribes, but also by many different peoples, and not only in the distant past. For instance, during WWII, Germans under Nazism kidnapped thousands of "racially desirable" Polish children and raised them as Germans.]<br /><br />The challenges of finding Debbie are formidable. Who even knows if she is alive? Considering the many different tribal groups that relocate on a regular basis, how is "Uncle Ethan" to locate her? Ethical issues sometimes come up in the film. The Reverend, for instance, opposes the continued shooting at attacking Indians once they have started to retreat.<br /><br />In time, Edwards finds out that Chief Scarface has his niece. But how to approach him without endangering Debbie's life?  The plot continues to build. In time, Edwards arranges a meeting with Chief Scarface. He is shown a belt of scalps, including those of his murdered relatives. He sees the now-teenaged Debbie, but she now considers the Comanches as "her people". Debbie's brother wants a violent assault on the Indian camp.

Do they come any better than this? The Duke is a war weary ex-confederate who becomes obsessed with hunting down the Comanche tribe who has massacred his family and kidnapped his young niece. We follow him for years as he will not let go of his mission or his beliefs. Wayne is amazing in this role as we see his hatred turn into humanity. This film has it all for the Western lover. It is from Director John Ford, and may just be his masterpiece. It is filmed in technicolor, and the stunning scenery may be viewed in the original widescreen(taking in all the action and rugged terrain), but also has the option of a standard version. It also stars Hollywood greats Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond and Natalie Wood.<br /><br />Contrary to the editorial reviews here, I thought the transfer of this  film from 1956 looked wonderful. The picture was clean and clear with very good sound. There are a couple of documentary shorts included, made at the time of the shoot, one has a brief interview with Natalie Wood(glowing from her recent Oscar nomination for REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE). It may be viewed in or with subtitles in English, French and Spanish, and it also contains some production notes.<br /><br />For big fans of The Duke or John Ford, or great American Westerns in general, you may want to consider purchasing this DVD in the John Wayne Collection: (The Cowboys/The Searchers/Stagecoach). Not only is it a great selection of Wayne's works, spanning 30 years, but check the prices individually, it could be the better deal. They each come in their own snap case and have an outer sleeve for the set.<br /><br />Saddle Up once again with The Duke for a great adventure and a powerful story.<br /><br />Happy Trails....Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Ethan Edwards, an ex confederate is to his own way, an outlaw. But I'd really like to make a crossroad in the analysis. Doesn't Ethan belong to the dinasty of the mytical hero? In the purest sense of the term. His origin is not very clear. And suddenly he appears, so he leaves at the end. In this sense his efforts for searching his kidnapped niece are an epic fight against all the obstacles.<br />And the turning point that makes that film so extraordinary, is the decission which prevails when he finally finds Debby and almost kills her. In this sense it's a personal choice. Through all his trip he has established his own code. He kills Putterman because it has to be done, and forget all the ethical reasons.<br />But when he goes to rescue her with the group, and finally saves her, you notice he isn't very satissfied with the result.<br />At last, all the people experiences a happy ending, but he doesn't seem to be very convinced with himself. And that's why he made a decision politically right.<br />John Ford was the western's director per excellence. The  film has unforgettable moments, the use of the objective, the travellings and the fantastic landscape in Texas support this jewel. If not for The wild bunch this film would be the greatest western movie, but a second place is not a trageddy.<br />In addition you can find in Ethan a close affinity with the beliefs of Pike in the wild bunch. Doesn't it tell you anything?<br />You must have this DVD in your collection. It's a must. Believe me.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>I suppose you could call this a sort of 'cult-classic' among John Wayne films.  It is considered one of the Duke's best (maybe even THE best) by many people, yet many critics gave rather discouraging reviews of the film (see Amazon's Editorial review, for example).  <p>This is an entertaining story about an old man who cannot hire enough men for his cattle drive, and who is forced to take along a group of boys instead.  This film finds Wayne in a somewhat different role, for although he plays a cattleman (not unusual for the Duke), he also has a soft, paternal side not often seen in his films.  This movie also differs in that Wayne does not emerge triumphant at the end of the film.<p>This is a great Western for any die-hard Western fan.  Not only fans of Westerns will enjoy this movie, however.  A great many people who do not like either the Duke or the Western genre thoroughly enjoy this movie, and perhaps that is what gives it such a lasting appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Wonderful evocation of the end of an era as the hard-work ethic gives way to the day of the get-rich-quick scheme.

Not only must he get the cattle to their destination safely, but he must also teach the boys how to be men.  Great supporting performances and a surprising turn in the plot toward the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>(Firstly, this is a review of the film, as opposed to the DVD or the blu-ray disc. For technical feedback, you may want to find something more specific. Just clearing that up. There are many reviews on this site and they're all different.)<br /><br />This is one of the greatest movies made. Obviously I'm not stating anything new or insightful by saying that. It's a known fact. Even if westerns are not your cup of tea, you must admit this is a powerful and well rendered piece of cinema.<br /><br />Hard to swallow that this movie garnered not one Academy Award nomination in 1956. Not for photography, score, acting? Was there a reason for this, I wonder. Possible. "Around the World in Eighty Days" wooed the Oscar people that year with an all-star cast and a grand and glamorous spectacle.<br /><br />Anyway, the places where "The Searchers" was shot are just breathtaking. That opening shot from the dark house to the wide open frontier has to be one of the best opening scenes in film ever. Ethan has come back to his brother Aaron's family after fighting in a war that ended three years earlier. He brings with him a quiet but seething hatred for indians (based on his demeanor towards his mixed breed nephew Martin).<br /><br />There's tension already but it soon gets even stronger. When Lucy lights the lamp for dinner and her mother quickly puts it out, Lucy instantly knows what is about to happen. And we get the general idea, too. Dramatic moments like this really make a movie crackle for me.<br /><br />"That'll be the day" seems like Ethan Edwards' slogan. Ethan is hard to figure. He is a hero and a villain in certain ways. He is smart and sensible but at times rash and tempermental. He is capable of anything, really. He seems to be a decent fellow at heart. He is a bunch of contradictions, and so are many people, so I think we can somehow relate to this man. Most of all he is determined. But is he going to rescue his niece Debbie... or murder her? It is a long journey, and it seems nothing will stop Ethan. I think his quest is not so much about finding a family member as it is about having a purpose that he thinks is right and true.<br /><br />Martin knows that Ethan is capable of anything; he is concerned that Ethan may do something bad (to Debbie), for she is now basically being raised as an indian. None of this is said but you can infer it easily.<br /><br />Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles are good in their supporting roles. It's sad that they cannot be together because of the dire circumstances. How ironic that they should be reuinted accidentally on her wedding day to another man!<br /><br />The film keeps the viewer thoroughly engrossed because we want to know if Ethan will find the girl, or if Ethan will die at the hands of the Comanche. I have to say that John Wayne is very effective here: larger than life, likable, robust, sometimes funny, raw, and relentless.<br /><br />Funny how you recognize certain actors for their roles in other vehicles; a regular in many of John Wayne's movies, Hank Worden who played Mose Harper in "The Searchers" would go on to play the tall elderly room service clerk in the 1991 ABC-TV serial "Twin Peaks". His face is instantly recognizable. And  the character of guitar-playing Charlie McCorry is played by Ken Curtis, who would play the cranky and scruffy deputy Festus on "Gunsmoke".<br /><br />When I think of this film I instantly think of blue and orange; the sky and the earth. I always recall the gorgeous red sandstone rock formations of Monument Valley.<br /><br />The story has been compared to Homer's Odyssey; and Ethan changes over time and becomes nearly as ruthless and brutal as the "savages" he is bent on avenging. But does he track down Debbie? You'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />Watching this movie, I just get completely involved with it and caught up in Ethan's journey. It's not just a physical journey, of course, but a journey of character and self discovery. In westerns, fight scenes and battle scenes tend to bore me, but character-driven stories really appeal to me. This one is all about the character. Ethan Edwards is as strong and memorable a character in cinema as any other: he belongs in the pantheon of greatest film characters... with Scarlett O'Hara (Gone With the Wind), Quint (Jaws), Marge Gunderson (Fargo), Atticus Finch (To Kill a Mockingbird) and Stanley Kowalski (A Streetcar Named Desire).</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This movie is when John Wayne was older. He owns a small cattle ranch and it is coming time to take them to market. All the ranch hands split to take advantage of the newest wave of gold fever. He is left without any help to find his stock to their destination. He visits a school on the suggestion of the local town bartender and decides to hire on some pretty talented young pupils to run the steer on the drive. They find themselves in some adventures and sad happenings along the way. The cook is a great character to watch and the way he dialogs to the others is like prose. It is cowboys and toughness with imagination. The things I liked were the cattle drive, I liked John Wayne's strength and his boundary setting, I loved the cooking that came from his wife and his excellent cook, I would love to go on a drive and have the best food south of the border, I love the idea of having bacon, biscuits and stewed apples, I love the cabbage and beans, etc., I loved the lay of the land, the quiet peace, the horseback riding, I loved the fairy tale way the cook dealt with the boys, I loved the simplicity of life, and I loved the little ranch house in the middle of only land that meets the eye with people who come not in droves but in small amounts where intimacy can happen if so desired.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Classic John Ford/John Wayne western, one of my favorites of all-time (along with the Searchers).</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>This was John Wayne's finest performance of his career and John Ford's most breathtaking with it's beautiful cinematography.  Wayne's role as Ethan Edwards was the finest work of his career.  Ford's visual beauty and social theme (racism and prejudice) in the movie was revolutionary for it's time.  This is a masterpiece in filmmaking!</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>I just watched THE SEARCHERS on HD DVD and was extremely impressed.  The color transfer is absolutely brilliant.  The colors are vibrant and alive, and the Utah badlands where the film was shot is gloriously represented in shape, shadow, and shade.  The film was originally shot in Technicolor in 1956, but I had no idea what the quality would be like until I popped the disc in and the first few frames started playing.  The wide, sweeping shots through the camera lens are breath-taking, but the filtered effects to do the "night" shots hold a glow to them and sharpness of the actors' shadows that just isn't possible in true dark.  Still, rather than being distracting, it's more indicative of the process that was used.<br /><br />John Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a Confederate cavalry man returning to his brother's farm after three years of wandering.  No soon is the family introduced than Ethan is called away to help track a band of Indian horse thieves.  But the trail is just a ruse and the Texas Rangers end up getting back too late to save their loved ones.  This starts up a manhunt for the last little girl from the family.  The trail crosses thousands of miles and five years, and involves changes within the characters.<br /><br />THE SEARCHERS was the 12th film John Wayne worked on with John Ford, and it stands the test of time as one of their greatest achievements.<br /><br />Although the story is a slower-paced than present-day tales would be, it encompasses a lot of territory and a lot of emotion.  Some of the accents(such as Ken Curtis's portrayal of Charlie McCory) were too pronounced and struck a false note.  And Jeffrey Hunter's emotional outlets were sometimes too forced.  The action sequences were given short shrift by today's standards as well, but on the plus side, a lot happens in the two hours of movie time.<br /><br />Western fans and John Wayne fans have probably already got this one.  If not, they should.  But the HD DVD version is definitely a reason to start thinking about plunking down hard-earned cash to upgrade the home entertainment system.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>There are striking differences between 'Stagecoach' and 'The Searchers' reflecting a change more important than the mere passage of time:<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' is a classic Western...

'The Searchers' explores complex moral issues and myths concerning the frontier...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' captures frenetic action and awe-inspiring panoramas... 'The Searchers' captures the beauty and isolating danger of the frontier...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' is about characters of clashing social classes/values... 'The Searchers' is the complex story of a hate-ridden quest and odyssey of self-discovery...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' shows the classic attack on the stagecoach by the rampaging Apaches... 'The Searchers' shows the Comanche attack on a home without ever showing the attack itself...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' shows one of the most enjoyable rides in cinema history... 'The Searchers' shows the Old West as visually magnificent, but very dangerous to live in...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' captures the untamed, rocky wilderness in Black and White... 'The Searchers' captures the vast, sprawling desert wilderness in grand Technicolor fashion...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach" is the first movie Ford filmed in Utah's Monument Valley... 'The Searchers' is the 9th time Ford shoots footage in Monument Valley...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' holds our attention because its story is in continual change... 'The Searchers' hunts us for its unique cinematic art...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' made John Wayne a star... 'The Searchers' stars the biggest Western star of all time the 'Duke.'<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' is a picture that excites the sight...

In 'The Searchers' he kills Comanches and even shoots two bullets at an Indian corpse...<br /><br />- In 'Stagecoach' John Wayne is a charming, reluctant outlaw... In 'The Searchers' he is an embittered man, a prejudiced Indian hater...<br /><br />- The essence of 'Stagecoach' is the humanity that resides in all of us... The essence of 'The Searchers' is one man's tragedy...<br /><br />'The Searchers' is a stunning film with enormous scope, and breathtaking beauty, the ultimate meeting of two legends who frequently worked together--John Ford and John Wayne...<br /><br />"The Searchers" brings the feeling to focus in the story of the abduction by Indians of two white girls and the long hunt for them that becomes a personal crusade...<br /><br />"The Searchers" is about just such a raid and the terrible obsession of a man who seeks not only to rescue captives but to exact fearful vengeance...<br /><br />John Wayne comes riding back from Confederate service in the Civil War, three years after it's over, to the Texan ranch he co-owns with his brother (Walter Coy). There's bitterness and mystery about the man... There are gold double eagles in his saddle-bags and there's a clammed up look in his eyes that says whatever he's done, or whatever he's been through, he's telling nothing... It's obvious, though, that he's glad to be home, that he's quite fond of his brother's wife (Dorothy Jordan), but he hates the fact that they've adopted a Cherokee half-breed (Jeffrey Hunter) into the family...<br /><br />When Ward Bond, a preacher-cum-Rangers' captain, drops in to form a posse, Wayne goes along with him, only to find later that they've been decoyed away by Comanches... He gets back to learn that his brother, his wife, and their son have been killed and their two daughters have been abducted...<br /><br />As always, certain words, sequences, images stay in the mind and evoke an emotional response:<br /><br />- The wind sweeping across the landscape and through a frontier woman's black hair...<br /><br />- The homecoming of a lean ex-Confederate soldier (against a bright sky) approaching a solitary house...<br /><br />- The sad reflective look of a loner, sitting on the porch with only a dog for company...<br /><br />- A married woman seen, by a Captain/Reverend, taking out and gently caressing her brother-in-law's cape in a manner that betrays her love for him...<br /><br />- The ride of the posse through the grandeur of Monument Valley, Utah...<br /><br />- White men riding scared through a valley while marauding Indians surround them between two parallel lines...<br /><br />- The anguish face of a man agonizingly realizing that his brother's family could be the target of a Comanche murder raid...<br /><br />- A shadow covering a ten year old girl, and the shocking view of an Indian standing menacingly before her...<br /><br />- The catchphrase, 'That'll be the day!'<br /><br />- A long view of a two searchers riding along a ridge in front of a sunset...<br /><br />- The passionate frenzy of an avenging man, shooting wildly at a herd of buffalo...<br /><br />- The 7th Cavalry riding beautiful horses in lines, galloping through an icy river, and carrying colorful flags against the white of the snow...<br /><br />- Dignified women line up on one side, and their well-behaved men on the other, to the tune of "Shall We Gather at the River."<br /><br />- The old man Mose, peacefully sitting, on the porch, in the family's rocking chair...<br /><br />'The Searchers' is a big motion picture that cries 'wilderness' and the images sustain it... The eye is constantly filled with space, and isolation... It is perhaps the first film to clearly investigate the emotional bases for the racial tensions between Indians and whites, and shows a shocking massacre of a Comanche village...<br /><br />John Ford was certainly a fantasist that has meditated on the West for a long period of years and has created an imaginary West that is uniquely his own... Ford was a folk artist, a master storyteller, a poet of the moving image..</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The impact of "The Searchers" and its influence is undisputed all you have to do is watch any of Sergio Leone's westerns or even "Silverado" (a love letter to Ford and Hawks' westerns). I'll admit I wasn't much of a John Wayne fan growing up but he gives a marvelous performance here as the hardened soldier Ethan who returns to his brother's Texas home after serving in the Civil War. When his neices Debbie & Lucy are kidnapped by the Commanche and the rest of his brother's family brutally murdered, Ethan with Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) who he rescued as a boy and Lucy's boyfriend Brad take off in pursuit in hopes of saving the girls and taking revenge.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Vera Miles ("Psycho"), Natalie Wood and Ward Bond.<br /><br />Beautifully shot in Monument Valley (among other places), Ford's film looks marvelous in this digital restoration. Shot in the Vista Vision process, the print they've used here looks clean with colors that pop.<br /><br />Extras include a commentary by director/writer/Ford biographer Peter Bogdonvich, as 1998 documentary on the production of the film narrated by John Millius, a new featurette on the film, an introduction by actor Patrick Wayne (who appears in the film)and vintage footage from the Warner "Behind the Cameras" TV series. We also get the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />"The Searchers" is a product of its time (including the acting)so keep that in mind if you are coming to this after watching films made in the late 20th century or early 21st. It's a marvelous film, beautifully shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This is a very enjoyable Western because it has the essential elements of great leading man, John Wayne, and great genre director, John Ford.  Jeffery Hunter was also very good here although my all-time favourite role of his comes much later and just before his untimely death as Capt. Christopher Pike of the Starship Enterprise.  I have always thought that of all the captains of the Enterprise, although his tenure was the briefest, he was the best actor of the lot.<br /><br />This film though has one of the most breathtaking scenery ever and makes full use of the colour medium to produce optimal results.  Monument Valley was an inspired locale to shoot this film and although the screenplay isn't the best with some awkward moments especially in the clumsy attempts at interjecting humour at various points that just didn't quite take, this is more than made up for with great camera work and great acting.  John Wayne is very convincing as a bigoted and racist bitter Confederate soldier who takes surrender and losing very hard who over the course of the film learns from Jeffery Hunter and his own observations to change his world view and becomes compassionate and less bigoted in the end.<br /><br />Overall, this is still although not a perfect picture a very, very good representative of the Western genre and like a true classic bears up well to repeated viewing.<br /><br />The only problem is with this version of the DVD which is very shabbily put together and is very poor.  The picture quality is terrible having not been restored and white spots and other imperfections abound on both sides i.e. Standard and pseudo-Widescreen versions although the few short documentaries on the bonus features were okay.  The only redeeming factor which warrants 2 stars is the excellent sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital and is clear and at a nice consistent volume level throughout.  Certainly one of the best dvds of an older film sound quality wise that I've seen.<br /><br />I notice that a Blu-ray version of this film has been released and as I haven't seen it, I hope that that version would have addressed the issues I brought up above.  My recommendation is to give this version a miss and check out the hopefully vastly improved picture quality of the Blu-ray version or wait for a much better improved standard version with a properly done widescreen format to become available.  Just give this dvd version a very, very wide berth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Beautifully filmed, including several iconic Western cinema images and, of course, the always photogenic Monument Valley and Natalie Wood. John Wayne's does a great job playing a character who is unrelentingly racist and, though his violent racism is the dominant theme of the movie and obviously meant to make him an unsympathetic protagonist, one wonders how evident this was to audiences in the mid-Fifties as opposed to how much it may have boosted Wayne's status as an American icon in the eyes of those who didn't realize that the character's hate-filled racism was supposed to be a bad thing.<br /><br />The stabs at comic relief using the cartoonish Swedish neighbor and the intellectually challenged Mose Harper wear thin after a while. Occasionally the staging, sets, and costuming are anachronistic; more 1950s Western than 1860s Texas - but the only really, truly jarring anachronism was white-girl-living-with-the-Indians Natalie Wood's very well applied lipstick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I was told that THE SEARCHERS was perhaps the best John Wayne movie ever made. Believe it or not, I'd never seen it before. So when I saw that the blu-ray was on sale at amazon for under $10 I decided what the heck, let's give it a go. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a rough and tumble man of the west comes home after fighting for the south in the Civil War. As the film opens, we see a woman through the front door of her house, Wayne on horseback riding to the house. This is the home of his brother and his family, a home that Ethan knew before the war. As the film moves on we get the idea that there was once something between Ethan and Martha, his brother's wife, but nothing is said aloud.<br /><br />Ethan is greeted by his brother and his family, a nephew, two nieces and a young man named Martin Polly (Jeffrey Hunter) who Ethan saved as a child, the sole survivor of an Indian attack on a wagon train. But the reunion doesn't last long when the next morning a group of men on horseback show led by Rev. Capt. Clayton (Ward Bond). It seems a group of Indians have run off with homesteader Jorgensen's cattle and they're about to search for them. Ethan insists his brother remain home but Martin goes along.<br /><br />Following the trail they discover that the cattle were stolen for a reason: to get them away from the settler's homes so they could be attacked. They split when riding back to cover both places. Ethan and Martin return to find the farm ablaze and the bodies of everyone but Lucy and Debbie, the two nieces now presumed kidnapped. This ignites a search that last most of the film as Ethan and Martin head out to rescue the girls.<br /><br />It would be so easy to offer bits and pieces of the story now, to tell you who makes it when and who doesn't. But that would take away what is an effective piece of story telling done by master director John Ford. He and Wayne made many movies together and many consider this one to be their best. The way he frames scenes, the way he moves his actors is amazing and in turn presents a story that you don't realize until it finishes.<br /><br />Watching the extras also helped me see so many of the things I missed while watching. We're a movie going public used to extreme violence when watching films these days. This film offers up violent images without actually showing them. The scene where Wayne enters what appears to be a smoke house to find the bodies of his brother and sister in law is gripping. You know how he found them by the look on his face, not by seeing the actual bodies. And in some ways that's more disturbing.<br /><br />One thing I was aware of with this film was the subtle discussion of racism involved in it. Made when this was a somewhat taboo topic, Ford and Wayne brought it to the forefront here. Several characters have this discriminatory view of the Indians in the film that carries on to their captives as well. The search for the girls takes 5 years and during that time young Debbie becomes a woman. The question of whether to bring her back or to kill her since she's been touched in more ways than one by her captor is central to the film. On one hand Ethan is ready to do what he considers his duty in killing her, on the other Martin, part Indian himself, is willing to do all he can to stop Ethan.<br /><br />This film offered something different for Wayne than previous roles. Before he was the hero, the cowboy, the one guy everyone wanted to be. As Ethan he's questionable at times whether it's wondering where he got the money he gives his brother or in the way he handles various situations. As the film progresses we witness a slow change over the years as Ethan's search for vengeance causes him to do worse deeds than when the search began. He's not a nice guy but he is someone you wish was on your side.<br /><br />The entire cast does a commendable job here. Each of them plays their roles note perfect. Veteran actors who starred in numerous Wayne films present themselves here as well as they've ever done. Ward Bond is cantankerous and at the same time a viable force for the old west. Hank Worden as Mose Harper portrays the man as perhaps simple but at the same time perhaps not. Maybe it's a face he puts on to keep out of harm's way. But the best cast member is Monument Valley.<br /><br />Like almost all of Ford's westerns, this one was shot in Monument Valley. Cut off from civilization for real, the cast and crew weathered some truly dangerous moments to bring this film to life. But its worth it was you view some breathtaking scenery. As I watched I thought to myself that while Frederick Remington captured the spirit and beauty of the old west on canvas, Ford was able to do the same on film.<br /><br />Like I said when I started, the film is available in blu-ray format for under $10 at amazon.com. It's worth that and more. I may not agree with the idea that this is the best western ever made or even Wayne's best western, but I will say that it ranks up there in the top. If you've never seen this one, make it a point to do so.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>If you stop and think about it John Wayne actually made several westerns that took surprising twists.  In &quot;The Searchers,&quot; Wayne played Ethan Edwards, who spends the entire film tracking the neice who had been taken by Scar's band of raiders so that he can put a bullet in her brain, only to end up taking her home.  But for his legion of fans, &quot;The Cowboys&quot; had to be the biggest surprise of all.<p>As rancher Wil Andersen, Wayne finds that his hands have left him to join a gold rush and he has no one to help him get his herd of cattle to market before winter. His only option are a group of young school boys, a hot headed young gun man named Cimarron (A Martinez), and an old cook named Jedediah Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne).  With hardly any training, Anderson and his &quot;cowboys&quot; hit the trail.  But not only do they have to do deal with hundreds of heads of cattle, rattlesnakes, and the elements, there are also a gang of man led by Asa Watts (Bruce Dern) following them as well.<p>I think that Bruce Dern had a pretty good career after this 1972 film, which was in doubt at that time because his character shoots down John Wayne in cold blood, which was definitely not considered a smart career move at the time.  Wayne warned Dern he would be hated and the young actor actually received death threats.  A movie in which John Wayne actually dies is always something of a shock for movie goers (e.g., &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;), but usually that tragic fate is saved for the very end of the film and in &quot;The Cowboys&quot; there is still the entire final act of the story left to be told.  The one thing you have to admit is that no other actor being killed off in the middle of a western could shock you more than the Duke.<p>Of the young cast of the film, Robert Carradine is the one name that sticks out the most as having made a career of acting.  A few of the boys were cast in the short lived television series based on the movie but just as many did this one film and never acted again.  However, the choice performances in &quot;The Cowboys&quot; come from the older cast members, with Brown's eloquent Mr. Nightlinger having a choice encounter with Colleen Dewhurst, who plays a madam escorting her stable of pretty young women to their next town of business.  Of course, the young girls are interested in the young boys, but as she wisely declares, &quot;The first time should be in the back of a buggy with a girl that they think they're in love with.&quot;  Then there is his charming refusal, &quot;I have the inclination, the maturity, and the where-with-all; but unfortunately, I don't have the time.&quot;<p>Of course Wayne's character slowly comes around to the idea that these young cowboys can actually get the job done, but the film requires them to complete their final rite of passage without him.  This 1972 western provides Wayne with the final great fist fight of his career that say him make 174 films from 1926 when he was an uncredited Yale football player in &quot;Brown of Harvard&quot; to 1976 when he starred in his eloquent final film &quot;The Shootist.&quot;  When Andersen begins his final fight his tells his opponent: &quot;I've broke my back once, and my hip twice. And on my worst day I could still beat the hell out of you.&quot;  Yes, Bruce Dern must be a pretty good actor to survive shooting John Wayne in the back.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>I liked the music, the nature was amazing - love watching the nature in these western movies<br />John Wayne's a great actor but the attitude he stands for is spoiled. George W Bush ruining of the cowboy image was one of the damages he made and Wayne characterizing the obstinate bully mentality that Bush took was not pleasant to see. I always liked Wayne but having seen this movie I see that while he's still a good guy and I like him, the cowboy mentality as exhibited by Bush is bankrupt. Also I didn't like the spirit of the movie which constantly had conflict as part of it - obviously all these characters were  in conflict w/ themselves else they'd know a more peaceful way of relating (not talking about komancho vs white but just between and within whites too)</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>THE SEARCHERS (1956) is probably the reason director John Ford is the record-holder for Oscars (he earned a whopping four under his own name) - and is probably one of the finest films in history. No doubt it always will be.<br /><br />Briefly, so I will never spoil anything, this film is about a returning Confederate officer Ethan (Wayne) who seems to rub his brother the wrong way, though the family adores him. The day following his arrival, the Comanche spring a murder raid on the family ranch, killing Ethan's brother Aaron, Aaron's wife, and kidnapping the two daughters. Ethan and another go on the hunt for these girls - a hunt that will last five years.<br /><br />Wayne gives what is for him a powerhouse performance here, but then he always gave such performances. His acting has been called unequalled, because he allegedly never equaled it again, and that's false. He gave this film the perfect twist, and the only feller I think might have done better is Gary Cooper.<br /><br />The subtle (and sometimes unnecessary) humor along with the star power will dazzle you. The scenery and cinematography will make your liver quiver. The action will make your knees freeze (you'll see everything from "Law & Order" to "NCIS" to every movie you can imagine in some of these scenes). The last third of the film will make your bladder splatter. [THANK YOU, Little Richard!]<br /><br />They say this film influences more films than any group or genre of films. They also say this is the best film ever made. They say this is far and away THE Western film of all time ... but "they" say lots of things. For me, this film is a slice of childhood that I still enjoy once or twice a year. It is still the reason we play cowboys and Indians, and for that I must remove a star from its rating. That anti-Native sentiment was ugly then and is ugly now. Hence Ford's film about the subject.<br /><br />Ford was decent and caring, though he hated to show it. He loved Kurosawa and was touched that "Mr. Kurosawa" looked up to him as a father. Ford was also aware that he had re-engineered Kurosawa's way of making film after THE SEARCHERS was released. Ford changed us all.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>John Ford and John Wayne team up again to make another Western film, they also worked together on Stagecoach.

The boys selected are first required to prove their skills. Gradually, they do. Indeed, if you like horsemanship, this movie is for you! There are numerous scenes of skillful horse riding, lassoing of cattle, branding of cattle, breaking-in of recalcitrant horses, the crossing of treacherous rivers on horseback, and much more. Much of this occurs on the cattle drive, where the toughness of the boys is pushed to the limit.<br /><br />There are some boyish episodes shown. The boys scare girls in their classroom with frogs. They have their fistfights. They talk about unclad females.  During the cattle drive, they steal some hard liquor from the adults just to see what it is like to get drunk. They find out!<br /><br />Some viewers may feel uncomfortable about the fact that the African-American cook is habitually called the N-word in this movie. But that is a concession to the usage at the time.<br /><br />The cattle drive turns deadly. A bunch of rustlers are out to steal the cattle.  Wil Anderson is ambushed. What will the boys do?

The story follows the efforts of two men trying to track down a kidnapped girl from Comanches over the course of five years.  The men tracking the tribe are a Confederate veteran and the girl's uncle and the other a family friend and also part Cherokee.  The film is beautifully shot as all John Ford westerns are, which adds to the overall mood of the movie.  There is a vastness to some scenes which show the futility of tracking down this girl after so many years.  The Searchers is a classic that provided John Wayne with a role that was different from any other he had previously played.<p>  John Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, the Confederate veteran trying to track down his niece after his brother's family is slaughtered by a Comanche raiding party.  He plays the role of the racist veteran to perfection.  At times it is startling to see him in a role that differs so greatly from most other movies he had done.  Jeffrey Hunter plays Martin Pawley, the Duke's partner in his search for the kidnapped girl. He plays a good sidekick to Wayne throughout since they have such differing personalities in the movie.  Also starring are Natalie Wood, Ward Bond, Harry Carey JR, Patrick Wayne, Hank Worden, Ken Curtis and plenty of other Wayne stock actors.  The DVD is good but could have been much better.  You can view the movie in fullscreen or widescreen, with trailers included alongside four documentary shorts.  A must have for western fans that is up there with Shane and The Wild Bunch as some of the greatest westerns of all time!</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Warner's newly restored and remastered version of the 1956 John Ford-John Wayne masterpiece finally brings home the film in an approximation of its original theatrical glory. Colors are remarkable, and images seem complete. Owners of previous versions should upgrade without hesitation.<br /><br />Peter Bogdanovich, the dependable (and prolific) DVD commentator, says "The Searchers" is "as good a Western as Ford made, maybe the best." "It's amazing how it was overlooked in its day," Bogdanovich says.<br /><br />Directors Martin Scorsese, Curtis Hanson and John Milius participate in a half-hour appreciation included as a DVD extra. All three dwell on the dark side of the film, whose treacherous crosscurrents include rape, sexual slavery, the slaughter of innocents, Old Testament vengeance and omnipresent racism. Few films burrow so deep into the audience's primal places. Even today, after viewing the restored film, Scorsese finds it "very disturbing."<br /><br />New-to-DVD extra features are the Bogdanovich commentary, a needless introduction by Patrick Wayne and the excellent half-hour "An Appreciation." Ported over from previous videos are the jittery Ken Burns-like docu "A Turning of the Earth" (Milius narrates) and a handful of "Behind the Cameras" TV puff pieces from 1956 with Gig Young. Warner had no alternate takes or deleted scenes to display, typical of the efficient Ford, Bogdanovich says.<br /><br />"The Searchers" comes in two double-disc sets with identical content on the DVDs. The "Ultimate Collector's Edition" adds only print materials, including reproductions of the 1956 tie-in comic and the original press book, along with some unremarkable memos and postcards.<br /><br />There is a good deal of repetitive material in the extras for this title and some of the other Wayne-Ford releases -- images, clips, stories -- but most viewers won't mind. Unfortunately, there's nothing on the music in Ford's films, such as Max Steiner's score for "The Searchers."</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>i had the pleasure (i'll never tell how) to see this fantastic two disc transfer of ford and wayne's greatest teaming.the movie has never looked better,almost like it was made yesterday.the color and sound leap off the screen at you and the extras are all that a ford or wayne fan could want.<br /><br />  the story(part of which inspired star wars) of a returning civil war vet eathan edwards(wayne in a stark unforgiven role of the racial intolornce of the western hero).after  indians raid a settelement the men ride out to catch them. but it is a ruse as the indians attack the homestead while the men are away. edwards brother and family are killed and his young nince is taken hostage.<br /><br />  edwards then sets off on a mission to find the girl and much like capt. ahab nothing,not time,not money,or the fact that she may be a wife to one of the indians will slow him down. as the hunt goes on it becomes clear that eathan plans to kill her when he finds her,not the wayne hero that we are used to.<br /><br />  with a very famous last shot (that looks better than it has in years ) i can't say enough about how well they have done puting this two disc set together.<br /><br />  if you love westerns or just love great movies,YOU MUST HAVE THIS SET!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>This film is set in 1868 Texas. Uncle Ethan visits his relatives in a dry dusty land. Ethan wears a grey coat and blue trousers. Ethan remarks about Martin's ancestry as if it was unusual. He gives a locket to Debra. Ethan's double eagles are freshly minted. [This could signify he rode with the James Gang.] Visitors drop by with news of a cattle theft. Could it be the feared Comanches? The house appears quite large inside, and well furnished. The posse follows the trail of the stolen cattle only to find them butchered. Was it a ruse to draw the armed men away? Whose home would be attacked? The returning men find fire, ashes, and bodies. Ethan, Brad, and Martin set out to search for those who attacked the family and rescue the kidnapped girls. The small group of white men are able to fight off a much larger group of Indians. Then they separate.<br /><br />The film follows Ethan and Martin on their search for Debbie. Brad attacked the Indians in revenge for Lucy's death. They return to the Jorgenson's home. Martin wants to join Ethan in the search for Debbie. [A $1,000 reward seems much too high.] A letter brings news to the Jorgenson family. [This is played for laughs.] We see a herd of buffalo, then a troop of cavalry. An Indian camp was massacred. Martin is now a widower. Ethan doesn't find Debbie at the Army post among the survivors. They continue to search. An old Mexican sells them news of Chief Scar. Has Debbie grown up? There is drama in the meeting, and the attack on Ethan and Martin. Ethan has made a holographic will making Martin his sole heir. Debbie is dead to him.<br /><br />Ethan and Martin return to the Jorgenson's home. They are wanted men for the deaths of Futterman and his men. Their daughter is set to be married to a man who is not her first choice. Martin and Charlie fight. The Cavalry arrives with news about Chief Scar being nearby.  What are Ethan's plans for Debbie? Martin wants to rescue Debbie. They attack the Comanche camp successfully. "Let's go home." Will there be a happy ending for all?<br /><br />John Wayne does not appear to be happy in this film. Was it changed much from the book? What about the charges against Ethan and Martin? What will happen to Debbie? Will Martin marry Miss Jorgenson? These loose ends are not tied up, as if they ran out of time or money to finish this film. What was the significance of Mose, a man with alopecia? This film is an example of myth-making, or revisionist history from Hollywood. I don't believe Indians would steal cattle only to kill them; its not cost-effective and goes against human nature. This novel was serialized in `The Saturday Evening Post', a popular literary magazine of that time. Its stories were often filmed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I was enjoying "The Cowboys" for about half the film.  The central premise, a desparate cattle rancher engaging young boys for a drive, is a promising one and for a good portion the makers of the film execute it well.  John Wayne, in the sunset of his storied career, had a good rapport with his young charges.  Roscoe Lee Browne provided lighthearted relief as the philosophical cook.  Then the film turns unexpectedly dark.  One of the boys dies in a freak accident.  Bruce Dern appears as a psychotic cattle rustler.  Dern is a favorite actor of mine but his character seemed like he belonged in another picture.  Revenge must be meted out and the boys dish it out with a vengeance.  This left a sour taste in my mouth which is unfortunate because this film had such promise.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>The image quality of "The Searchers" is nothing short of startling. We'll get to that after I've lit into the film. Yes, I'm going to tear to pieces what is generaly considered one of /the/ great American films, and (by many people) the best Western ever made.<br /><br />John Ford was a great director, but I've never cared much for his Westerns. Maybe I'm tired of seeing Ward Bond play the same role again and again. Or perhaps it's just that I don't care for John Wayne, who is hardly my model of ideal manliness. (Jimmy Stewart was ten times the man John Wayne was.)<br /><br />"The Searchers" has two major problems, neither of which -- as far as I know -- has ever been pointed out. (After writing this, I browsed the Amazon reviews and found that other people have almost-identical reservations.) They render it a far poorer film than it could or should have been.<br /><br />The first is that it tries to tell two stories that have little to do with each other, and fail to mesh in any meaningful way. The primary story is Ethan and Martin's five-year search for Ethan's kidnapped niece. This is intercut with the broadly comic narrative of Laurie's frustration at trying to get Martin to come back and marry her. (Note Ken Curtis, later Festus on "Gunsmoke", as her dorky, guitar-strumming suitor.)<br /><br />It doesn't work. The search is morbidly dark, while Laurie's plight is silly beyond belief. Any possibility of dramatic unity -- this is, after all, a serious film about a serious subject -- is destroyed. (Aristotle would have heartily agreed.)<br /><br />Which brings us to the other problem. John Wayne was no actor. He was more than a decade from reaching the point where he could turn in a credible/creditable performance (Rooster Cogburn in "True Grit", for which he won an undeserved Oscar). In "The Searchers" he is still John Wayne, with a limited performance range that doesn't extend beyond what John Wayne, the man, is capable of.<br /><br />True, Wayne had a difficult job for any actor -- he had convey his hatred of Indians and desire to kill Debbie for 99% of the film -- then abruptly change his mind. The problem is that we see no motivation for the change. He picks her up, she looks frightened (she knows what he intends), and then, out of nowhere, "Let's go home, Debbie." *<br /><br />It just isn't believable. Ford should have shown us John Wayne's face, so that we could have gotten /some/ idea of what was going through his mind. Why he doesn't is anyone's guess. Did he think Wayne was incapable of believably revealing his change of heart? Or did it never cross Ford's mind? Regardless, the film lands with a dramatic "thud" -- Something Important happens, but we don't have the least idea /why/. The moment the story is building up to /never occurs/.<br /><br />"The Searchers" would have worked far better if it had stuck with the search, and ignored just about everything else. Yes, it would have been an even darker film, but it would have packed a far stronger punch.<br /><br />I should not fail to mention, if only in passing, Max Steiner's miserable score. "Max Steiner" and "miserable score" are more or less redundant. The few good moments are swallowed up in a lot of unnecessary and trivial music.<br /><br />So why do people hold "The Searchers" in such high esteem? The reason appears to be that it was one of the first "deconstuctionist" Westerns. ** Ethan Edwards is bluntly racist, and is determined to find his niece so he can kill her. She's been polluted by her five-year contact with the "Comanch", and his no longer a "white" woman. *** She'd be better off dead, and Ethan is the man to do it. But however awful the Indians' behavior is, we are not on Ethan's side. Our broad sympathies lie with the Indians, not the Americans. ****<br /><br />Unfortunately, "The Searchers" doesn't achieve what it sets out to do. It's all hat and no cattle. You don't get points for trying to be profound -- you actually have to achieve it. In this, "The Searchers" fails quite badly. It's easy to imagine a remake that's far superior to the original.<br /><br />As for the transfer... Oh... my... God... I couldn't believe it. It appears to have been derived from the VistaVision camera negatives. I have never seen a more exquisitely sharp and detailed video image (and with zero apparent edge enhancement). Ford's use of multiple image planes, some in-focus, the others out -- is clearly displayed. *****<br /><br />Please note that in the supplemental material, someone describes "The Searchers" as having been filmed in three-strip Technicolor, which it almost certainly wasn't. And Martin Scorsese avers that VistaVision has greater depth of field than conventional 35mm movies. Wrong -- it has less. (It's hard to understand how someone who's been making films for four decades doesn't understand Photography 101.)<br /><br />If you're a fan of "The Searchers", do yourself a favor and get the Blu-ray. Even if you don't care for the film, buy it anyhow. It's a great demo disk. This was a film /made/ for VistaVision ("Motion Picture High Fidelity") -- the scenery alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />* One critic suggested that it's touching Debbie that causes his transformation. He can't bring himself to kill the flesh-and-blood being he knew as a child.<br /><br />** It also appears to be one of the first to make a stab at proper cowboy attire. Note the dusters on several characters.<br /><br />*** Another minor problem... Kidnapped whites almost always preferred living with the Indians. Debbie's willingness to return is not implausible, but it is unlikely. In the very last moments, she does show some apparent fear at being among whites again.<br /><br />**** According to the supplemental material, "The Searchers" was the first Western to show a lot of dead Indians lying around after having been massacred by whites.<br /><br />***** This is common in Ford's films.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Goodness, how my perception of this film has changed over the years.  When I first saw this pimple-faced shoot-'em-up in the theater, I was mesmerized, and I was part of the crowd that took to its feet and cheered when Bruce Dern got what was coming to him.  Over the years, as fatherhood and an expanding waistline greeted me, I would come across this motion picture and find myself wincing somewhat.  A Montana cattle drive, led by an aging rancher and a cook with a Shakespearean delivery, and a dozen or so boys not even old enough to shave as cowhands--yeah, right.<br /><br />But this is John Wayne, and this is his senior citizen landmark film, THE COWBOYS.  The movie enjoyed resounding box office success, pleased the Duke's legions of fans, and even spawned an awful, short-lived TV series.  As rancher Wil Anderson, Wayne is his usual tough 'n gruff, crusty and cantakerous hombre; yet the Duke also reveals a kinder and gentler side as he becomes a father figure to his peach-fuzzed employees.  Yet as well as Wayne is in this role, the movie is so inherently flawed--first by the premise of young boys actually driving a herd of cattle, followed by these same boys going on a cold-blooded, avenging killing spree--I find myself growing more and more uncomfortable with each subsequent viewing.<br /><br />Guess I'm getting mellow in my old age.<br /><br />Bruce Dern is a perfectly hateable villain; Roscoe Lee Browne a wonderfully laughable and unbelievable chuckwagon cook who looks like he was plucked from the pages of 'Othello.'  Of the ensemble of 'Cowboys' young Robert Carradine is most noteworthy--and much more memorable via his 'Revenge of the Nerd' roles.  Yet, despite its flaws, THE COWBOYS is vintage John Wayne action and revenge, even though the violence is jarring and unsettling.<br /><br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is slightly better than most films with John Wayne, but in retrospective. A farm is attacked by some Indians. Everyone is killed except a very young girl who is taken along by the Indian chief. The film is the story of the tracking of this chief and the salvaging, retrieval and liberation of the girl who was made the chief's wife, one of them. It shows how the girl will, when found, ask for her fellow whites to consider her life is set and settled now and that she must be left to her lot. They will fail this first time but they will go on searching for her and they will finally trap the Indian community and they will demonstrate their great generosity by killing all the Indians and only recuperating the white girl by force. At the time when the film came out it was vindicating that genocidal treatment of Indians based on the myth that the whites had the right to take Indian land without even paying for it. Today it is a perfect demonstration how deep that genocidal spirit is engrained in the American consciousness of history. We have to celebrate the very recent decision of Congress to provide some Indians with reparations for the way they were treated, even after having been parked in reservations, as a miracle of faithfulness to the principles of the Declaration of Independence, for whose Founding Fathers there was no doubt that Indians and enslaved or indentured people, mostly Black, were not born equal, because they were not born human. The film shows how the dominant culture in the USA and in Hollywood used the genocide of the Indians as a good conscience builder among the whites who were engaged in so many wars all around the world against "minority races".<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>A classic coming-of-age movie, especially for boys becoming men.  Wayne brings to life Wil Andersen, one of his most heart-tugging characters as the tough cattle-drive boss turned father figure.  Through his example a rag-tag band of boys become men willing to take on the responsibilities of being men.  Some of the most memorable John Wayne lines are delivered in this, one of Wayne's less-famous films.  This film includes, surprisingly, some of Wayne's best supporting cast, from the boys to Mr. Roscoe Browne as Mr. Nightlinger and Bruce Dern as the longhaired bully/cattle-rustler who juxtaposes Wayne's noble character.  This is a film worth watching again and again with themes especially good for helping boys struggling to become men of character.<br /><br />A comment has to be made for the soundtrack as well.  The soundtrack is one of the most rousing and moving John Williams compositions and complements the film perfectly.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>I am laughing at John Milius' marvelous comments on the feature on disc 2..."For people to say that John Wayne isn't a good actor is the stupidest thing in  the world...all you have to do is show "the  Searchers"!

Because all the men in town are off in search of gold, rancher Wil Andersen is forced to hire 11 schoolboys to help him drive a herd of cattle to Montana.  Obvious problems arise on the trail as Andersen and his cook, Jebediah Nightlinger, try to help the boys learn how to be cowboys.  Andersen, Nightlinger, and the 11 cowboys also must deal with a band of rustlers threatening to steal their cattle herd.  The plot for this movie is nothing special, but it is still a very enjoyable movie.  John Wayne and Roscoe Lee Browne are very good as are the kids.  For a Duke western, the ending is a little shocking, but the revenge motive works here as the &quot;cowboys&quot; go after the rustlers.  The Cowboys is a beautifully shot movie in the barren desert and the green mountains that deserves a watch to see the Duke in one of his last movies.<p>  As usual, John Wayne is excellent as rancher Wil Andersen, who must watch out for the eleven schoolboys turned cowboys.  He takes on a father role to them which is very believable by the end of the movie.  Roscoe Lee Browne is also very good as Andersen's cook, Jebediah Nightlinger, who must deal with more than a little racism on the trail.  Bruce Dern with his rattlesnake theme is incredibly creepy as rustler, Long Hair, although sometimes his character has been called Asa Watts.  The 11 cowboys are all pretty good in their roles including Robert Carradine, A. Martinez, and Alfred Barker Jr.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, production notes, a featurette on the making of, and trailers from 13 different John Wayne movies.  The Cowboys is not an action packed western, but it is still entertaining with good performances from the Duke, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Bruce Dern.

Though not without its minor flaws, "The Searchers" (1956) is propelled by John Wayne's ambiguous, complex performance as the embittered Ethan Edwards - his best work for the legendary director. The Ford stock company acquits itself admirably. Winton C. Hoch's cinematography deserved an Oscar for this powerful and remarkably influential film.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>The Searchers is one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />However, you will only find this out by watching it a few times.<br /><br />I bought the DVD on the strength of Scorcese rating as one of his top five films. On first viewing I thought it was OK, but subsequent viewings have confirmed Scorcese's view.<br /><br />You have to view the film in context. This was made in 1956, by a director who had been working in films from the 1930's. Unlike modern films the pace is leisurely and the character development is measured. Even compared with say the first Clint Eastwood dollars movie (8 or 9 years later) this is filmmaking from a different era.<br /><br />The story is simple Ethan's niece (a young Natalie Wood) is kidnapped by Indians. Ethan (John Wayne) vows to find her and then (after time has gone by) to kill her (as she has presumably been abused by the Indians). There is no question this is John Waynes best acting performance.<br /><br />A previous reviewer has critised the portrayal of Indians as savages, and some of the interior (exterior) sets - but like I said above this is a film that has to viewed in context. The special effects options when shooting in the studio in 1956 were very limited.<br /><br />The use of Monument Valley is marvellous, and many scenes benefit from this natural wonder, however the greatest scene is reserved for the climax to the film which I'm not going to tell you about!<br /><br />John Fords direction is mostly straightforward, but occasionally a classic shot will happen (like the framed doorway) and you realise what an influence this film has had.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>In THE COWBOYS John Wayne as Wil Andersen has to resort to using boys to mount his cattle drive. He takes these boys and makes men out of them and then cowboys. This is an interesting film and goes against John Wayne's somewhat stereotypical and programmer type films he was making near the end of his career. Wayne plays this rancher convincingly. The premise of the story is intriguing and its outcome takes several twists before its conclusion. The intervention of Bruce Dern as a very evil villain on cattle drive and his demise is shocking. These boys learn about being men but perhaps learn a cruel lesson along the way. John William's rousing score is a highlight.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>Let me be the first to say that I am by no means a fan of the western. I find them to be generally cliched and conventional, and rarely original. However, The Searchers is one of the greatest movies of all time and it avoids all the western cliches, telling an emotionally resonant story amid the backdrop of the uncivilized west without a single duel on an abandoned road. As a result, it has been proclaimed the King of the Westerns for years, a judgment with which I must agree.<p>The plot is legendary. John Wayne gives a great performance as Ethan Edwards, ex-Johnnie Reb and newly returned to live quietly with his brother's family when Commanche warriors kill them all and take off his niece to be raised among them. Edwards then begins his obsessive search along with sidekick Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) to kill his niece, figuring her to be better off. The frank examination of racism in this film was unusual for the genre and time period, and the depth of the characters and their respective arcs make this film one of the greatest ever made.<p>Unfortunately, the film is flawed. When watching it it is impossible to forget that this is a fifties-era western because of the presence of cowboy music and the cartoon-like introduction. Not that I favor changing it, but it sort of takes one out of the movie. I guess my beef is that it is a film of its times, rather than transcending it completely. Aside from this there is very little wrong with the film and it has aged well.<p>In short, this is a movie that belongs in the collection of anyone who loves a great film, even if you, like me, don't like the western in general. Its complexity and excitement make it still interesting and exhilarating today.</p></br></body></html>

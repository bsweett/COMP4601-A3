Theron's transformation from Hollywood beauty to forty-something burned-out highway hooker occurs inside and out. While makeup can depict weather-battered skin, and a few extra pounds can take the bloom off the rose, Theron becomes alternatingly swaggering and pitiable, melting into the tottering psyche of Aileen. Her perpetually down-turned smile is both a mark of inner pride and an expression of the bravado that she needs to survive emotionally.<br /><br />As depicted in the movie, from a tender age Aileen craved for acceptance and love. The men in her life, from her abusive father to her schoolmates, only abuse her. The closest she comes to love is in letting men use her body in every degrading way imaginable. She prowls the highways, selling sexual favors for pitifully small amounts of cash. But after years of this degrading work, one trick turns violent and Aileen guns down her assailant. This seems to empower her in a way she has never experienced, and she continues to kill for money, partly to avoid hustling, partly to support her young paramour, and partly for revenge. It's not hard to see where this not-too-bright, friendless, alcoholic and unconnected person will end up.<br /><br />As seen in the DVD featurette, writer/director Patty Jenkins connects strongly with Aileen. Jenkins sees Aileen as a victim whose world has cut off every avenue of escape. Jenkins also sees in Aileen the desperate need of every human being to be loved. When Aileen meets Shelby (Christina Ricci) it seems that for the first time she has a chance to hope and dream of something better than hustling truckers and married men. Whether the film accurately portrays the true Aileen Wuornos is something I cannot answer. In fact, Jenkins's attempt to tell the "larger truth" about Aileen practically screams "agenda-driven distortion!" A larger truth than Jenkins's may be that when you make a film about people (including the men Aileen murdered) it is important to depict them fairly and accurately. Whether Jenkins did that, or just chose to take the word of a likely psychotic, drug-addicted, emotionally damaged woman is the big question. By choosing to ignore Aileen's drug problem (replacing it with excessive alcohol consumption) or her ever-shifting testimony about the murders provides an insight into Jenkins's possible agenda.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as a story of how a victimized human being whose last shred of self-respect comes exploding from the barrel of a gun, the movie is affecting and upsetting. As an unvarnished look at the humiliations and trials of the disposable people that some use for their gratification, it is troubling and moving. Viewers must ponder the question of the identity of the "monster" of the title. Is it Aileen, washed-up loser, prostitute and deranged serial killer? Or the men and communities that trampled her human dignity? And if the answer is "both," then what do we do with monsters we willingly create?</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>As advertised (and Academy-awarded) this movie contains a brilliant, startling and sensational performance by Charlize Theron as the true-life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron is over the top yet at the same time so totally controlled that her character is beautifully--if horrifically--realized.  Opening as a much-abused street hooker who is treated like trash by almost everybody, Theron morphs "Lee" into a swaggering, macho murderess in a manner sure to chill many viewers straight to the bone.  Yet all the while Theron conveys the vulnerability of a tragically twisted person who was never loved, only beaten, raped and tossed aside.  The sordidness of her life and the hopelessness of her future are indelibly etched upon our memory.<br /><br />Much of the credit for this once in a lifetime performance must go to director Patty Jenkins who also wrote the script, which is itself quite a sensation.  Jenkins books no compromise with propriety or with the audience's sensitivities.  She rubs our face in Aileen's dehumanized life as a street hooker picked up by strangers who treat her like filth and abuse her in ways that are unspeakable.  Central to the irony of the film is the fact that her life is that of a likely serial killer victim herself, since women who ply their trade in such a way are most vulnerable to sadistic attacks.  But "Lee," inspired by her passionate and first-in-a-lifetime love for Selby, her mousy lesbian girl friend, played with sly and sneaky sparkle by Christina Ricci, turns the tables on the sickies who pick her up and finds a measure of short-lived empowerment by blowing the johns away with a large revolver.<br /><br />Jenkins uses quick and deft strokes to establish who and what Aileen is, and just as deftly establishes Selby as the church-going wallflower at the local same-sex bar.  Jenkins's technique thrusts the viewer headlong into the story as Aileen drags herself out of the rain and into the bar to meet Selby who immediately latches onto her.  Quickly they become friends, and then in a compelling and entirely convincing scene, fall in love while roller skating.  This is followed by a steamy alley engagement in which both "Lee" and Selby discover their wild passion for one another.  Both scenes are among the best of their type that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Although Theron got the major share of the glory for the success of this movie, and Jenkins most of the credit, Ricci was not far behind.  Her character too is etched in my mind.  How wonderfully cast were the two, the one physical and manlike, the other weak, naive and femme.  And how lifelike the chemistry and how tragic the conjoining.<br /><br />Yes, this is an American tragedy thurbo'ed up for sensation-seeking audiences, presented with relentless views of violence and sensuality, featuring humanity at its most debased.  So over-the-top were some of the scenes that I found myself unaccountably laughing in surprise at the sheer hutzpa of Jenkins's savage treatment.<br /><br />Be forewarned that this movie leaves little to the imagination, and when it does, it makes sure you know exactly what depravity you are to imagine.  As such I would not recommend that anyone with delicate sensibilities view it.  It is a study of the character of two women who find first love and first real passion together, but it is so thoroughly laced with violence and depravity that for many that love will become nothing more than ignoble animal lust.<br /><br />See this for both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, two of cinema's most gifted young actresses.</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>While IMHO "Monster" is an absolutely amazing film, it obviously is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But the only reasons for criticism are writer/director Patty Jenkins' exploitation of a real-life situation and the perception that serial killer Aileen is portrayed as more of a victim that those she murdered. While there is some logic to those arguments, I think Jenkins actually showed considerable restraint. Exploitation and character identification are inevitable in this type of story. It is more a question of degree-if you compare this to 1990's tearjerker "Too Young to Die" (starring Juliette Lewis in an almost identical story), Jenkins comes off as a model of objectivity and distanced perspective.<br /><br />What is most unique and compelling about "Monster" is that it is much more a love story than a thriller or a crime drama. The two main love scenes are absolutely riveting, with intensity levels higher than you are likely to find in any other film. "Tide Is High" and "Crimson and Clover" will never sound the same.<br /><br />One thing that works unexpectedly well is the incredible contrast between the two characters. Jenkins works hard to emphasize this, with camera shots that emphasize the physical size differences coupled with dialogue and behaviors that emphasize the contrasting personalities of this odd pair. Having Scott Wilson play the last murder victim is a homage to an earlier "Mutt and Jeff" pair of murderers, as he played Robert Blake's "In Cold Blood" sidekick.<br /><br />Although most of the critical acclaim has gone to Theron for her portrayal of Aileen, I think that a lot of the credit for Theron's masterful performance should go to Ricci's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Selby. Watch Ricci's eyes in all her reaction shots, it is as close to acting for the camera perfection as you are likely to ever see.<br /><br />If you really enjoyed Theron's incredible transformation from her typical hot starlet to this gritty prostitute role, then check out Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion" (1965) and "Belle de jour" (1967). While not as physically extreme as Theron's transformation, Deneuve's two characters are equally hard to reconcile as being played by the same actress. Yet another acting for the camera marvel, as wardrobe, makeup, and hair-styling combine with behaviors and speech to effect an amazing range between two characters played by the same actress.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Model Charlize Theron plays an abused girl (Aileen Wuornos) who grew up to become a homeless, mentally-disturbed, slow-witted prostitute, and ultimately becomes a serial killer. Early in the film she meets Selby Wall, just beginning to accept her lesbianism. Theron tries to stop 'hooking,' but cannot get a 'regular job.' Returning to her prime expertise, she encounters a dangerous customer who severely beats her. Theron escapes her ties and shoots/kills him.<br /><br />Done once, it becomes too easy to repeat as an easier source of money. Eventually she kills a total of seven, is caught, convicted with the assistance of Wall (in exchange for immunity), and ultimately executed after 12 years on Death Row. While three psychiatrists concluded she was sane, her behavior suggested otherwise at the end.<br /><br />Further research establishes that Wuornos never met her father because he was in prison for rape/attempted murder of a 7-year-old girl when she was born. He subsequently hanged himself, Wuornos and her brother were placed in the custody of their grandparents. Both the grandfather and her brother had sex with her, as well as others in school. At 15 she was thrown out of the house. More prostitution, an armed robbery, forged checks, and a failed marriage to a 69-year-old followed.<br /><br />Watching all the violence was not enjoyable; however, it provided insight into the reality of those with severely diminished mental capacities.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Critics and film audiences applauded Charlize Theron's revivting performance in 2003's "Monster" which documents the real-life incidents of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who went on a killing rampage in the late eighties and early nineties, eventually murdering 7 men. The film details the torment Aileen went through as a young girl, feeling unloved and abused, to the point that she became a street walker. Instead of feeling hatred for Aileen we feel for her as the movie makes the viewer realize the anger and torment a person goes through to get to the point of becoming a prostitute. Even the fact that she becomes a killer still doesn't make us hate her, as there is one terrifying scene where she is raped and battered by a john in the isolated woods. In order to survive she kills this man, which is the starting off point of her murderous rampage. The film is a lesson for us all as we see how society can be insensitive and crue to people, and its that insensitivity that can eventually make monsters out of people. Theron won a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal; in the film she gained 30 pounds and wore fake teeth to alter her Hollywood glamorous look. Most critics, even Roger Ebert, stated that Theron gives the greatest performance of any actress in any year. In one word her portrayal is spellbinding. The blueray comes with the trailer, a featurette, and interviews with Patty Jenkins who wrote the screenplay as well as directed the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a great film.  The actors are absolutely first rate:  Theron must have gained 30 pounds for the part and is completely unrecognizable and thuggishly ugly; Ricci is a kind of mousy yet complicit accomplice, greedy for experience.  The two meet and find an unusal synergy:  Theron is a seriously troubled, alcoholic hooker with a horrible past and prone to violent rage, and Ricci is a lesbian trying to escape her prying family.  Somehow, they find love in a completely believable way.  In addition, the story is rivetting. To maintain their life style and express her rage, Theron goes on a murderous rampage of robbery and murder, after killing a brutal rapist.  In a way, she is searching for justice, but gets crazier as she continues and feels increasingly desperate to maintain Ricci's love, which is perhaps the only good thing she has ever known and yet based on the cash that Theron brings in.  It is very sad, the viewer empathizes with Theron, and yet feels repelled by the horror and confusion and murder.<br /><br />Truly masterful.  Recommended with enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Monster is a fascinating little film. Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci are flawless in their roles. This film is not for everyone, it is violent, unsettling, and provacative. Theron plays a true-life serial killer who picks up men and brutally takes their lives. You have to see this gritty and exceptional roller coaster of a film. I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'Monster' is a marvelous movie because Charlie Theron plays her character with such thorough knowledge and conviction that we are convinced that we're watching prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos like it was done the first time.  Add to the fact that writer/director Patty Jenkins makes all the right moves to tell the story without softening or sermonizing, and you have yourself a movie classic.  Surely, it's not easy stuff to take in, but it's so interesting, one becomes glued to the heartaching tragedy in every detail.  Much like 'Dead Man Walking,' this film brims with authenticity and assembles itself with an unflinching camera and leaves the audience to judge in its aftermath.<br /><br />Having been a prostitute since age 13 and having been disowned and abused in numerous ways, Aileen can only earn a living on the way she was brought up.  Having to face a particularly nasty "John" she overreacts but at least has a plausible self-defense argument to muster.  Having a desperate challenge for tenderness and money, she comes upon a lesbian, Shelby (played with excellent tension by Christina Ricci) from a devout Christian household when she stumbles into a gay bar.  Trying a little tenderness her occupation lacks, she enters a relationship her original proclivities forbade.  Finding rare compassion her storage unit landlord, Tom (played effectively by Bruce Dern) and striking a partnership with Shelby, she, nevertheless, goes down a slippery slope; one that makes her a modern MacBeth with more fate following her than ambition.<br /><br />It can't be said enough how well-rounded and detailed Theron's performance is made.  Capturing pathos and desperation, 'Monster' reveals the rationalizations and roadblocks that make this story such a masterpiece in unsettling anguish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Who would have guessed pretty woman, Charlize Theron, could have been transformed to look almost exactly like female serial killer Aileen Wuornos? Let alone give an acting performance not to be missed!!<br /><br />Great screenplay/movie on how Aileen Wuornos became the female serial killer she was and of the crimes she committed! Great acting performances by both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>If I could only use one word to describe the feeling I had when watching 'Monster', that would be it.  Painful.  As I watched the account of this woman's life I was in constant agony for I felt for her and her situation, her horrific lot in life.  Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) is not the monster here.  The monster is the life she led, the life forced upon her, the life that ate at her everyday.  Aileen, prostitute since thirteen, never knew anything more than what she had, and as the film opens we see that she is about to take her own life because of this, that was until she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).  Selby (real name was Tyria Moore) is a closet lesbian who wants to come out against the will of her overbearing parents.  She meets Aileen in a gay bar, a place apparently Aileen was unaware was a gay bar, but after they meet they lose something they've felt their whole life...they no longer feel lonely, alone.<br /><br />In order to keep Selby by her side Aileen turns back to prostitution but after being abused horrifically by a 'John' Aileen makes a change.  That's when the murders begin, and even though some are not justified and some are heartbreaking (especially when she murders and innocent man out of pure fear and hopelessness) you never feel as though she deserves what she gets.  She didn't deserve the hand she was dealt and its heart wrenching to see her have to go through everything she went through.  Yes, it's true that not all women who are raped by their father figure turn out to be murderers, but I don't feel that's the reason she killed.  There is so much we don't know about the woman that was Aileen Wuornos, but from Charlize's brilliant performance we gather that she was afraid, she was alone, she was confused and she was emotionally dieing if not already dead.  She had been abused in everyway possible and thrown out without a chance, without a care in the world, even by the ones she loved the most (most notably Selby).<br /><br />This is a truly heartbreaking and, yes, painful film to watch but it's one that we all do well to experience to know the tragedy we ourselves are at times too guarded (and judgmental) against.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This controversial film is worth seeing, if only for Charlize Theron's outstanding, Academy Award winning performance. Ms. Theron totally loses herself in the character of Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer who murdered seven men in Florida and was arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Aileen Wuornos was finally executed in 2002, after spending many years on death row.<br /><br />The film details the hard knocks life led by Aileen Wuornos, from that of a troubled teenager looking for love in all the wrong places to that of a hard living prostitute. It also looks at the very human side of Aileen Wuornos, a woman who found love in the person of a troubled, young lesbian in her late teens (Christina Ricci), who would ultimately betray the trust that Aileen Wuornos believed lay between her and her eventual fate.<br /><br />Ms. Theron's physical transformation is startling, though I found her still recognizable as Charlize Theron. It is her performance, however, rather than her physical transformation, that is more startling, as she infuses it with a high voltage intensity and swagger that bowls the viewer over. She makes the person of Aileen Wuornos come to life. She is a low rent individual, white trash to the core, prostituting herself by getting into cars in order to have sex with total strangers. So, this film is not for the fastidious, as we are looking at the seamy underbelly of the beast in this film, and it sure isn't pretty. It is also a credit to Ms. Theron's compelling performance that the viewer is able to feel pity for Aileen Wuornos, a woman who is so vile, yet, at the same time, so vulnerable and pathetic.<br /><br />The direction is excellent in the film, as are all the supporting performances. Christina Ricci is very good as the weak, passive, troubled young woman with whom Aileen Wuornos enters into a lesbian love affair, a relationship which lasted years in real life rather than the short time depicted in the film. Ms. Ricci infuses the role with a certain amoral, vapid selfishness that makes the character's betrayal of Aileen Wuornos comprehensible. Bruce Dern, in the role of Thomas, Aileen Wuornos' only true friend, is a stand out, as he adds depth to an otherwise small role. It is clear that Thomas saw something in Aileen Wuornos that the rest of the world missed. It is the most decent relationship that Aileen Wuornos appears to have had.<br /><br />The film itself, despite the stellar performances, is somewhat flawed, as it is unclear as to what made Aileen Wuornos tick, though it makes an attempt at deciphering her psyche. There are several theories that are exposed for the viewer to ponder: abused child, rape victim, and love sick puppet. They fall short of explaining adequately this troubled woman who would go on to achieve such notoriety. Notwithstanding this unresolved issue, the film is still a compelling one, though not one I would necessarily care to view again, as there is nothing at all uplifting about the disturbing and sordid life led by Aileen Wuornos. Consequently, I consider this film to be a one shot deal, despite the wonderful performances.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) is a woman looking for any flicker of warmth and light in an ice-cold world of black. The only reality she's ever known is that of abuse, violence, exploitation, rape, and utter betrayal. She is the product of years of hammering on the soul-destroying anvil of street-life and selling her body for money. Moments away from commiting suicide, Aileen meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) in a bar and sparks fly, leading this hopeless woman to believe she might actually find happiness. Aileen attempts to run off with Selby and save her from her hyper-religious family. She hits the streets in order to make enough money for them to get away, only to be viciously attacked by a sadistic john, who is bent on torturing and killing her. Aileen shoots him to death in self-defense, which hurls her into a downward plunge that she'll never be able to escape. She becomes an avenging angel of death, executing johns and stealing their cash and cars.  Selby watches as Aileen falls deeper and more unreachably into darkness. However, this is not the typical Bundy / Dahlmer / Gacey serial-killer tale. Aileen Wournos is a sympathetic / empathetic character who kills not only out of rage and vengeance, but out of a sorrow so deep it has become lethal and uncontrollable. Based on the true story, MONSTER is the all-too-human tale of a desperate woman's last gasps before dying. It's not pretty, but it is totally genuine and believable. I kept rooting for Aileen and Selby to somehow rise above it all, even though I already knew the outcome. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>No one could predict Charlize Theron playing this role and winning an oscar no less.  Roger Ebert even went on record saying this was one of the best performances he had ever seen in film history. (Considering how many thousands of films critics see, that's saying ALOT).  I still can't believe it's her when I see the movie.  What an amazing transformation, up there with Nicole Kidman's in "The Hours".  Charlize's performance is so gut wrenching and sad it almost makes you  feel sorry for this woman you almost forget is a serial killer. You end up feeling so bad for her when she's out trying to turn her life around and go on job interviews, only to be scoffed at and denied,  (i'm sure we've all felt that rejection at some time in our lives).  I only wonder if Ailleen Wournos actually did try to find a way out. Rather than view this movie as a play by play real life crime drama, I was more impressed with the brilliant acting.  Christina Ricci also did a great acting job, she's always a trip.  I have no idea how Charlize channeled the aura and energy of her character but it is almost unreal to watch. A sad and ironic twist of fate that Miss Wuornos didn't get to see the movie about her crime spree life and an academy award won in her essence.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>The movie is a sad and depressing look at the life of Aileen Wournos, one of the most notorious serial killers in American history.  As we see her slow desend into her murderous rampage, we also see what her life was.  Raped at the age of 8 by a family friend, forced into prostitution to make ends meet and then finally kill a john in self-defense.  We see that she had the chance to straighten up her life.  Unfortunately, she had no choice but to go back to the life she lived before because no one would give her the chance.<br /><br />Never have I seen a better performance in the last 40 years.  Her performance is one for the ages, right up there with Marlon Brando, Bette Davis, and Katherine Hepburn.  Charlize Theron is an amazingly beautiful actress.  The transformation into the character in this movie is incredible.  She is barely recognizable!  In addition to Theron, Christina Ricci gives a great performance and has blossomed into a great actress.  Those who are not familiar of Wournos' life should look further by reading "Lethal Intent" by Sue Russell or her autobiography in print or the DVD documentary by Nick Bloomfield.  This movie is unforgetable!</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I have to admit that I'm a johnny-come-lately, having just now gotten around to seeing this film starring the lovely and talented, Charlize Theron.  Ms. Theron has had some interesting roles, (Cider House Rules, The Italian Job) but this role is the defining one of her career up to now and shows us just how well she can act.  Had she relied solely on the amazing makeup and weight gain for the role that transformed her physically, Charlize would not have been able to convince us that she was Aileen Wournos.  But she took that step a really good actor or actress makes to really become the person she is portraying and really made the role believable and thorougly watchable. Christina Ricci was also good as the young woman, who beguiles Wournos and then betrays her once the truth is revealed about her killing spree.  But it is Theron who shines and absolutely deserved the Academy Award she won for this role.  I look forward, with great anticipation, to the roles she chooses in the future and I highly recommend this film featuring such an amazing performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I was hesitant as to whether or not I wanted to see this movie, but I am glad I did.

And there is no way of knowing about the details of the relationship between Aileen Wuomos and her young lesbian girlfriend Selby, played by Christina Ricci.  But it doesn't really matter because, due to the excellent writing and directing by Patty Jenkins, the characters come across as very real and very human.<p> <p>Charlize Theron is cast as Aileen in a performance that won her an Academy Award.  Whoever did her makeup should get an award too.  All her glamour and "babe-like" qualities are hidden.  And what comes out is the true actor inside of her in every sense of the word.  Every gesture, every expression on her face and every bit of anger and pain come through as authentic and real.  She's totally believable as the deeply troubled woman, damaged by life.  She's desperate for love and a little bit of happiness.  But she hasn't a chance.  When one of her customers seriously mistreats her, she kills him in self-defense.  After that she just keeps killing. <p> <p>As I recently saw the documentary about her life just a few days ago, I couldn't help comparing the films. Both were excellent.  But while the documentary left a lot of open questions, "Monster" answered them.  Therefore, part of my experience of watching "Monster" was trying to figure out what was true and what was not. But after a while I relaxed and just let myself get into watching the film for what it is.  And it's a truly fine film with outstanding performances.

She gave Aileen a story a voice and showed what it was like from her perspective and why she did the things she did. You can actually sympathize with Aileen and feel her pain at points in the film. But towards the end you dont know what to feel because she keeps killing innocent men. You still feel a little bit sympathetic for her even after what she has done, this film really makes you think about right and wrong and people in general. It makes you not so quick to judge others circumstances because you dont know what they are going through. All in all this is an excellant movie with great performances by all. Aileen finally has some recogniton.Wouldnt say its good recognition but it portrays her as more than a monster but also a human. All she wanted was To have a chance and im sure if she can see this now she would be happy for once in her life to have her story told and to be understood. This film portays her as a human but dosent condone or make light of her crimes , it shows it all in a raw in your face way. It shows the good and the bad. Its a well acted, very entertaing film.

I was very hesitant to watch one more trip to the sociological garbage heap. The difference with this movie is that if you miss Theron's performance, you will have missed one of the greatest acting performances of the year. I admired the acting; I didn't care for the movie. Theron seems hypnotized into thinking that she is real life killer Aileen Wournos. Here is an actress who seems to channel the soul of the person she is playing. Excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>I don't think the Academy Awards people have had any trouble in choosing the winner for the best actress in a leading role, nor I think they took too much time to arrive at their decision,despite the other wonderful performances of the other nominees.<br />Anyone who watches Monster, and the mind blowing performance that is so gritty, real and totally involved and involving would not flinch for a second in presenting Charlize Theron with a truly deserved award!<br />The story itself, a biopic of infamous serial killer Aileen Wuornos, has been filmed before,(I don't think such a 'meaty' subject matter for a movie would had to wait till now to be filmed),but there is a difference..<br />For one, all credit should go to writer/director Patty Jenkins for her totally sympathetic and unsentimental treatment of the Wuornos story.She was more than capable of handling the complexity of emotions, with very visual as well as character based approach.<br />Although the story is told largely from Wuornos's point of view, the success that Jenkins manages to achieve is to win the viewer's sympathy for both killer and victims: there are no real monsters in Wuornos's story..just a very tragic life, a woman who has been abused for so long by family and 'customers' and neglected by society at large when she tried to 'go straight', pushing her back into the ending that she could not avoid.<br />And while the loss of lives of the innocent men she killed was totally inexcusable, the feeling I got from the film was that Aileen Wuornos was also dead long before she was executed.<br />A very powerful scene sees Wuornos in the back of a corrupt cop's car, allegedly booked for some complaint but picked up for sexual favors. She tries to pretend that she is having a day off from a normal 9 to 5 job,but then the cop revealing that he knows what she does for a living, replies sarcastically, do you go to church on your day off?<br />I find this scene extremely important because it shows how Wuornos tried to maintain her dignity as a human being but failed..very sad indeed.<br />The relationship between Aileen and Selby (played so well by Christina Ricci in one of the best roles so far) which is central to the whole story,was very well written. We know that Wuornos was not gay but someone who craved affection and love and (as she says in the film)can 'train' herself to love a woman to achieve a most desperate need to love and be loved.<br />I thought the love scenes were very well filmed, with enough passion between the two women, yet never gratuitous.<br />Now a word about the acting again..<br />Charlize Theron is not only one of the most beautiful women ever, but she is equally talented..She reminded me a bit of De Niro, Hoffman, Kidman or Streep, that kind of actor/actress who totally dedicates him/herself to his/her role, not only emotionally but physically as well..and had I not known she is playing the lead role, I would have been be excused even for few seconds for failing to recognize her..this is how great the physical transformation and likeness to the real Wuornos is.I would also like to mention that I real loved Pruitt Taylor Vince, one of the best actors in American Cinema today, and although his role was short, he as usual excelled.<br />So Monster is a real gem of a movie, a tragic story about the life of one woman who from early on had all the odds stacked against her, and at a moment of weakness unleashed demons that slowly took control of her, and had to pay dearly for it. A Must Buy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Charlize Theron gives a five star+ performance as the executed serial killer Aileen Wuornos, the monster in &quot;Monster.&quot; I would have rated the movie the same, except it is just too filled with pain, desperation and hopelessness for me to rank it that high. The script is not particularly strong. We only get a glimpse into the life and mind of this woman, and we never discover what made her kill. Many abused women hate men, but they don't become serial killers. There is also a lot of repetition, as Wuornos goes through her pattern of solicitation, violence and anguish over and over again. Without Ms. Theron's magnificent acting the film would be rather mediocre.  <p>Director Patty Jenkins begins Wuornos' story in 1989-90, just before she was caught and imprisoned. She portrays Aileen more as a victim than as a victimizer. Through an initial monologue and various dialogues the viewer learns of Aileen's very troubled childhood in Michican. Her father, a convicted child-molester, committed suicide. Aileen was raped repeatedly by a family friend, and she began prostituting herself when she was thirteen. Her only job had been as a hooker. I think Ms. Theron portrays Aileen as a woman suffering from serious mental illness. Her moods swing from suicidal depression to euphoric overconfidence. She had delusional periods where she believed that all her dreams would come true and that she was invincible. She is a tough talking lady who drinks too much and barely holds her rage beneath the surface.<p>It is during this period that she meets Selby (Christina Ricci is superb in this role.), a shy, naive teen, in a bar. Selby is a lesbian who wants to come out of the closet against her family's wishes. She is a misfit, without friends. So is Aileen. At first the two are so thrilled that they like each other - that they are not alone anymore. Their desperate, mutual quest for affection culminates in this doomed relationship. To me the relationship is more about loneliness and emotional dependency than physical attraction. The honeymoon is short-lived, however. Selby had never been on her own before and for some reason, doesn't think to get a job. She expects Aileen to provide for them. She manipulates Aileen into continuing to work as a prostitute, even though she is aware of at least one murder. Jenkins suggests that as long as the money keeps coming in she will ask no questions. Wuornos tries to get work and go straight but has no job skills or experience. She winds up going back on the road as a prostitute again, and then, after a violent episode with a john, her rage takes over and the murders begin.<p>Charlize Theron does give an extraordinarily powerful performance as the serial killer. It is amazing how she was able to literally transform herself into a woman who looks exactly like the actual Aileen Wuornos, mannerisms and all. This transformation is not just make-up. She speaks like Wuornos, walks like her, with a masculine swagger, captures her intensity, and her eyes often hold a glint of madness.<p>The film is shot in a gritty style on the highway, streets, bars and motel rooms. The ambiance is pure sleaze, reflecting the true crime drama. Overall, the story is fascinating, as is the point of view. And, as I have said, the performances are simply excellent. Highly recommended!<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>"Monster" delves into the mind of the first female serial killer, Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron.) But it does not condone what she did or take sides. Instead, the film describes her life over the nine months after she found love with Selby (Christina Ricci); from 1989 to 1990. I really liked the narration/voiceover that Charlize did (as Aileen.) It lent a little credence to the movie and some humanity to Aileen, as well.<br /><br />Charlize Theron very rightfully won the Academy Award for her portrayal of Aileen Wuornos. Charlize completely metamorphosed her entire look which was so eerie and uncanny because it was impossible to tell that she was acting in a movie. She also changed the sound of her voice, sounding exactly like the women she played. Charlize is a true actress and very deserving of the Best Actress nod from the Academy. Christina Ricci was also excellent playing the shy and introverted Selby, and has proven herself to be a very accomplished cinema actress.<br /><br />The movie follows the tale of harried and hopeless Aileen Wuornos as she tries to pick up the pieces of her shattered and tattered life. When Aileen meets Selby it was almost love at first sight. Selby practically saved her life and for that Aileen was forever in her debt. I think my favorite scene was when they were together in the bed (that first night they met) and Selby asks Aileen if she could touch her face. Aileen seemed so sensitive and gentle.<br /><br />Besides that horrible rape scene and other depictions of degradation (I really hated that scene with that scumbag cop that picked her up after her job interview), I also found the scenes when Aileen tried to look for work very bitter. No one would give her a chance or listen to her. She had no money, no education, no family; absolutely nothing. All the doors were loudly slammed in her face. Society gladly threw Aileen Wuornos away. She was just another hooker, why did it matter that she wanted to clean up her act? Charlize was especially perfect during these parts. Her look of rage, and total desperation was purely obvious.<br /><br />Another aspect of this story that I found terribly sad was when Selby turned her back on Aileen. Aileen loved her more than her own life and she finally thought that she had a chance of happiness. Maybe Aileen also thought that she finally found a person that she could honestly trust. Maybe if Aileen never met Selby she would still be alive today?<br /><br />I really liked the way the movie ended. It wasn't too deep or sad, instead I found it very surreal because it wasn't too weighty. The movie ended the way it started, with Aileen narrating to the viewers in her own sarcastic and comical way.<br /><br />"Monster" did make me feel sorry for Aileen because she was obviously an incredibly broken person that was never given a fighting chance. Someone please tell me why is Aileen vilified while these horrible men that raped her and sexually abused her aren't? Whoever said it's a man's world sure wasn't kidding.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Monster is based on the true story of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a common prostitute that left a string of dead Johns in her wake.  Aileen (Lee) is on the verge of taking her own life when she meets up with Selby, a lesbian who is looking for companionship.  Selby gets Lee to talk, and they agree to meet again the next night.  Lee needs money, so she takes to the streets to make some cash.<br /><br />Her last John brutally beats and rapes her, and in an act of (what seemed to be) self-defense, Lee shoots him to save her own life.  Selby and Lee hit it off and decide to set up house together, each having their own ideal of what 'a real life' should entail.  While Lee believes that giving up hooking and finding a real job is the key to her new life, Selby is too dependent to go out and get herself a job, therefore remaining reliant on Lee's income as a prostitute.  Life does not stay peachy for the new lovers, and after many heart-breaking rejections from the job market, Lee returns to hooking in order to feed her and Selby.<br /><br />Whether Lee had simply had enough of prostitution, or whether the last brutal John soured her, or simply the idea that she had gotten away with it once, Lee adds a new twist to her hooking schema; murder.<br /><br />Monster is not a fast paced story of the police investigation hurdling towards finding a killer, but the horrifically commonplace lives of two women who want more out of life but can't seem to find their way out of the trenches.  It didn't strike me as 'what would you do for love' type of story either, simply a deviant's twisted mentality of right and wrong.  It is a story of the human inside the animal, even a human as alien as Lee was, and the presentation those animals will make to remain human as long as they can.<br /><br />Get ready to see the performance of a lifetime from previously uncelebrated actress Charlize Theron.  She *should* have won the award for her amazing performance in Monster, never again will you see her as a 'blah' or 'so-so' actress.  She immersed herself so deeply into the role that she became almost unrecognizable as the Charlize you have seen before.  The talk, the walk, the mannerisms, are all portrayed with a natural flow, you simply will not believe how good she is in this movie.<br /><br />Special mentions go out to Christina Ricci (Selby) and Bruce Dern (Thomas) for their stellar performances also.  Director Patty Jenkins receives a tip from my hat also, for finding the human inside Aileen Wuornos and bringing it to the screen.  In the featurette, Patty mentions that Lee's behavior wasn't about strength or weakness, but about damage, and she managed to highlight this in the film.<br /><br />I'm not usually a big fan of Special Features, but you absolutely MUST watch the featurette, where it shows the work behind the scenes and how they transformed Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  It's not just seeing the make up applied, but watching her mannerisms change as she imbeds herself into the role.<br /><br />Monster is a superb movie, an emotional killer, which will leave you full of both pity and rage at what becomes of those who society turns their polite cheek away from.  I highly recommend Monster as a 'buy' rather than 'rent' DVD.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Though this film is brutally honest about Aileen 'Lee' Wuornos' crimes it does provoke some sympathy for her. Yes, she does kill many people (all men) but when you consider how many men battered her and raped her all through her life, even as a child, it's no surprise she became so psychotic.<br /><br />And I don't think it's exactly fair that she got the death penalty. Surely it would have been best to help a woman who lived her entire existence in the dregs of society (which is surely to blame for sending her mad) than executing her.<br /><br />Focusing entirely on Lee instead of the police investigations following her (there is a TV movie from the mid-90s that does exactly this if you're more interested), we see her straggle from thinking about suicide, hooking up with lonely, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), killing in self-defense and finally killing for revenge/money.<br /><br />Charlize Theron completely vanishes as she brings her take on Lee (her full name is never mentioned in the film) to the screen. She sure deserved her Academy Award and Christina Ricca (who is very cute here) is also very good. However, for a lesbian couple I just didn't see any real feeling between them. It annoyed me how fast the film moved and there are not really many quiet moments for these two characters to bond in any way. Yes, they proclaim their love for each other but I just didn't see it. There was too much shouting and screaming.<br /><br />There are no surprises in the film, as we all know how it ends anyway. But some of Lee's killings are harsh, compelling and even ironic. The overall effect of the film isn't so long-lasting on me though.<br /><br />It's shot and lit like a TV movie and Lee's heavy judgment at the end of the film is played down. For a film that is slightly biased to her point of view it's annoying that her unfair trial and life are not exploited just a little bit more for us to gain a little extra insight into the making of a 'monster'.<br /><br />Keep a lookout for Kane Hodder as an undercover cop near the end.<br /><br />The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound and some slight extras.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>Wow......<p>Charlize Theron is brilliant in this film with her portrayal of &quot;serial killer&quot; Aileen Wuornos. Theron not only manages to completely change her looks but her entire persona, she becomes Wuornos, capturing all of the mannerisms and deep bedded anger that Wuornos exhibited during her trial. Theron's acting is fantastic and through her performance many questions are raised, some that will stay with you for awhile.<p>Christina Ricci should not be ignored in her performance in this film either. She captures naive innocence in her role as Wuornos's girlfriend. Ricci's emotions are raw and she holds her own against Theron's brilliance.<p>But this film is really more than just the acting; it is a statement about right and wrong and about the justice of our death penalty. I don't think anyone can walk away from this film and not feel that Wuornos might have deserved a different sentence. While I agree she was wrong to kill her victims I have to wonder what any normal woman might do under her circumstances. Rape is almost as brutal as death despite the lack of permanence. After seeing the life Wuornos had to live I became wracked with compassion for a woman with no place to turn. Was she right to kill? No! But at what point is a person a cold blooded murderer and at what point is she crushed by her circumstances. At some point blame needs to rest with the child abusers, rapists and sexual predators that helped to create Wuornos and others likely to come in her wake. This film will really cause you to reflect on where you stand on issues like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>What a great movie. Where do I begin. After having seen interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos in Life and Death of a Serial Killer ( a film based on personal interviews with the real "Monster" ), I realize what an Outstanding performance Charlize Theron gave. Also, heads up to the make up artists for transforming beautiful Charlize into looking strikenly like Aileen. Charlize well deserves the award she won for her performance in this true story. What a perfect pick! I have to say also that the character of Selby ( played by Christina Ricci ) was well played. As everyone must know by now, this film is a true story about America's first female serial killer. Although the movie does not go back into Aileen's ( Lee ) childhood, the viewers can sense that this woman must have had a rough life. The movie starts where she meets Selby in a bar and they soon become lovers. What Selby doesn't know is that Lee is a killer.... at least not until later in the movie. Lee spent most of her time as a highway prostitute in Florida. After being picked up and raped by a John, she murdered him and stole his vehicle. This soon became a pattern for Lee and she had to kill over and over to get both cash and a new vehicle...... for she would get rid of the other vehicles soon after she took them so she wouldn't get caught in them. After wrecking a car with eyewitnesses at the scene, a sketch of Lee and Selby were put all over the news stations and Selby began to run scared. Lee got enough money for Selby to get on a bus and leave, while Lee remained there in Florida. The police eventually caught up with her and she was apprehended at her favorite local bar. Aileen was sentenced to death for the murder of 7 men. She was executed by lethal injection. If you like true stories and don't mind violence, I strongly recommend renting and buying this movie. I've seen alot of true stories made into movies but this one has to be one of the very best ever made. Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I've read the reviews, and no one can argue that Charlize was brilliant. She needed this shot at legitimacy.  Patty Jenkins gave her that chance, after lovely performances in "Cider House" and "Mighty Joe Young". No loveliness here; a fine brutal display of a disillusioned, selfish crazy-person. Christina Ricci deserves more credit for this. She had to match the insanity with unsettling discovery. Everyone knows the story, but I only want to say that the DVD has a lot of great extras. It's worth watching. Theron is quite brilliant, and Jenkins' direction is "right-on". Not quite as riveting as "Boys Don't Cry", but almost as honest in the brutalty towards misunderstood persons.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Even for those who aren't big fans of lesbian films such as myself, one can't deny Charlize Theron credit for her simply brilliant performance as Aileen Wuornos, the prostitute who was tried and executed for her killing spree in Florida.  The film is well directed and has good acting.<br /><br />Subject-matter excluded, the film is a good character study.  By the end of the film, the audience can (if not accept) understand what factors in Aileen Wuornos' horrible life were responsible in turning her into a such a psychotic monster.  Being a low-end call girl walking the streets and the victim of many male creeps and perverts, its somewhat easy to see why she became a lesbian and a killer: not that this is any excuse for what she did.  The film actually wants to show how Wuornos' lover Selby (Christina Ricci) was encouraging her killing spree so that she could keep running from her relatives.  I could've done without the steamy love scenes though.<br /><br />Again, although I hardly even have a modest interest in the gay film genre, this film was well acted and directed.  Charlize Theron truly deserved an Oscar for her role.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>I do not like films that take a sympathetic view to the lives of killers. Killers are not to be sympathized with. They are to be executed. The overall effectiveness of this film, however, is too powerful to deny. It was an amazing work of art. This film is so well done, so well thought out and written, that what is left is a portrait of a ruined human being caught in a downward spiral of horrible self-laceration. <p>The main character's unbreakable decent into evil is charted out like a map with only one road. There were actual scenes (particularly the &quot;job interview&quot; scenes) where I found this killer heartbreaking - just as heartbreaking as I found the killer's last victim (the great character actor, Scott Wilson) pleading for his life. <p>What can be said about Charlize Theron's performance that hasn't already been said? Nothing, really. Suffice to say, a well deserved Oscar. I have never seen an actor completely disappear into a role like this. Ever. Theron was all the way gone. I have never seen a more convincing job. <p>Definitely not a film to set a romantic mood with the girlfriend. But one I bet you won't forget any time soon. --Mykal Banta</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>MONSTER is an admirable movie, in the way that it makes our loyalties shift from character to character.  We are introduced right away to Aileen (Lee) [played by Charlize Theron...more on her later], the soon-to-be first ever female serial killer.  She is unattractive in a way that says "I feel ugly on the inside, and that has bled into the outside," rather than, "Because I was ugly outside, my soul has become ugly too."  She is, quite obviously, rotten at the core.  She goes into a bar, mostly to escape the elements, and finds she is in a gay bar, and there she meets the character played by Christina Ricci, who is a not-quite-out-of-the-closet lesbian, making some very shy forays into the gay world. She is unattractively dressed and wearing a huge cast on her arm, so her desparation to connect makes her even more unappealing to the more happy-go-lucky crowd around.  She and Lee connect though, and a "torrid" affair develops.<p>At first, Ricci (who lives in a tiny bedroom in the ultra-religious home of some family relatives she's been shipped off to) and Lee are a "happy" couple...crazy and irresponsible, but so glad to have made a connection with another human being and not to be found repulsive.  But soon, we see some ugliness coming out...unexpectedly, it comes from Ricci.  She is fascinated that Lee is a prostitute, and when Lee makes a (sad) effort to "go straight," we are dismayed to see that Ricci seems to want Lee to continue her life as a prostitute.<p>Then Lee (whom we have come to feel very sorry for at this point) is brutally attacked by a customer. She fights back and kills the man.  At this point, we are ready to cheer.  She is empowered and certainly seems to be within her rights to shoot the guy.  But when she returns to Ricci with the man's car, Ricci's greed comes out even more, and their love for each other begins to curdle.<p>Lee begins to kill for less and less "admirable" reasons, and by the end of her spree, our feelings have flip-flopped for her.  <p>The movie is frank and brutal.  In the crowd I saw it in, there were plenty of shocked gasps...not from gore, but from the cold natured brutality.  Somehow, low-budget movies just make the grittiness of violent death feel more REAL.  Death  Be Not Proud, the quote goes, and it certainly isn't in this film!  <p>Yet underneath it, the movie is still structured something like a predicatable TV movie.  Cleaned up just a little and cast with a TV star instead of a movie star, and you could have a "movie of the week." Ultimately, the movie doesn't really have anything big or new to say.  We see how Lee became a serial killer, but this only sheds illumination on her, not on the world in general.  The story IS fascinating, no question, but at the end, you don't really leave the movie with a big feeling one way or another.<p>Charlize Theron.  She has never been a favorite of mine. She is glamorous, and was okay in films like CIDER HOUSE RULES.  Often, though, she's little more than an adornment to the film, usually attached at the hip to a man.  Here, the male characters are VERY minor, and Theron spends most of her time on screen with Ricci.  Much has been made of her makeup, and it is stellar.  She is pretty much unrecognizable.  And  unlike, for example, Nichole Kidman in THE HOURS (remember the rubber nose?), Theron's makeup  is seamless.  But what she has done here is transformed herself. Her entire posture has been given over to the realities of her character. Not one bit of glamour is there to be found.  It is a brave performance, and one that should make it possible for her to find meatier roles.  But MONSTER'S BALL didn't help Halle Barry get "juicy" roles...just bigger paychecks.  We'll see what Theron's fate is.  I'm not entirely sure she should win the Oscar...as amazing as her performance is, there are some gradations lacking. It begins to feel a little bit predictable by the end.  But if she does win, I won't begrudge her.  <p>But adult movie audiences looking for a unique, engrossing film could do far worse than MONSTER.  It's a trip into a previously unfamiliar world.  Just leave the kids at home!</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>MONSTER would still be a good movie without Charlize Theron...but after watching it a couple of times, it is fascinating to watch Ms. Theron literally disappear into this serial killer.<br /><br />For a woman who is used to walking red carpets and gracing magazine covers, she really becomes an ugly, badly-damaged woman hooking along lonely highways. There isn't a false note in any single frame of this movie. She deserved the Academy Award, that's for sure.<br /><br />From what I've seen in the documentaries about Aileen Wornos, this film humanizes her more, shifts a little away from her mental illness, and makes Christina Ricci's character more attractive, although it keeps her betrayal of Aileen at the end.<br /><br />This is a sad, frightening story about women on the outside and the lengths they'll go to find love and acceptance in a dark and horrible world. Even cold-blooded murder.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>Polished to perfection, Monster is a notch above the rest in production, writing, direction, acting and in every other aspect. Charlize Theron's amazing physical and character transformation creates a mesmerizing realism. The entire presentation of the Aileen Wuornos story is an eye-opener, narrarated by her character and seen through her eyes. Though the real-life woman's story changed quite often, this portrayal was neither sympathetic nor harsh, leaving judgement to the viewer. Truly an unforgettable film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>The dramatized version of the real life story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, who was executed after about ten years on death row. Roger Ebert hailed Charlize Theron's performance as one of the best ever in the history of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I love to drink while watching movies, but I was so transfixed while watching this movie, I barely drank at all, and had a dry mouth by the end of this movie. I'd be shocked if I blinked at all, while watching this.<br /><br />I bought this, purely because it was in the sales, and it was on my wishlist. And I needed to spend some money. So I got this.<br /><br />I'd never really heard of Aileen Wuornos before, apart from all the press coverage saying that Charlize Theron was going to play her. Now, I'm more curious about her whole story, and after watching the movie, I'm curious to find out what happened to Selby, apart from the fact they never spoke again. I'm curious to find out why these people like Aileen spend so much time on Death Row, and why they can't be exectuted straight away. To spend 12 years (and more, in the case of Kenny Ritchie) on Death Row, only to die in the end seems pointless.<br /><br />As soon as Charlize appeared on screen as the hard, butch, Aileen, my mouth dropped open. I just could not believe it was the same girl. There's two shots in the movie where she appears topless, and in just her underwear, and it's amazing to see the physical transformation she's gone through just to play Aileen. Charlize, notorious in my eyes for being super skinny, has boobs & a booty, and cellulite. There is a God after all! She gained 30lbs for this movie, and although it's slightly too much, she looks better with a little bit more flesh. She's so tall (5ft 9 and a half - the half is always important), that she can carry it off well, whereas, Christina Ricci, who only gained 10lbs, looks plain dumpy. After a while, you stop comparing the Charlize on screen, to her normal self, and you get caught up in the story, and really begin to believe that it's Aileen - it's almost like her spirit possessed Charlize. Not many actresses can pull that off.<br /><br />What was so noticable about Christina, apart from how utterly short she was next to Charlize (she's 5ft 1), was how young she looked. This was probably to make the difference between the two actresses as big as possible. And Christina's hair was dreadful! Absolutely dreadful! With only five years between the two actresses, it would have been difficult to make the beautiful actresses look as harsh as possible, to make a bigger comparison.<br /><br />I loved this movie, I was warned beforehand that I would probably hate it, but I didn't. I was fascinated by the entire movie, and was shocked, and was nearly in tears by the end of the movie. It never excuses the murders, or attempts to make them any less cold-blooded murders than they already were. Also shown is that Lee (her full name is never given in the movie) does have compassion - she never killed the stuttering virgin. The film is shown to be very bleak & sparse, and none of it was in the slightest OTT. Just a grittier, more realistic version of Thelma & Louise.<br /><br />Aileen's murder victims have been fictionlised to spare their families more grief & embarrassment. But they're still well-portrayed, especially the last John. You really felt for Aileen & him in the final moments.<br /><br />If you're a rather sensitive soul, and cross yourself every time someone swears, then you should avoid this movie. Aileen drops the F-word (and other related words) a mere 189 times. But her coarse language is absolutely necessary to the character. You can't imagine Aileen every being brought up to speak politely.<br /><br />This movie has definitely aroused my interest in Aileen, and I'm going on the hunt for her biography, which is no doubt out there somewhere. The movie & Charlize have to be seen to be believed, and afterwards, a lasting impression will be made on you. This is a movie that will never be forgotton.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>'Monster' is not the first film that feature the life of Aileen Woumos -- Jean Smart did her role in made-for-TV film 'Aileen Woumos: The True Story' in 1992 (which I have not seen), and director Nick Bloomfield made TWO documentaries 'Aileen Wuomos: The Selling of a Serial Killer' in 1993 and 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' in 2004.  So, what makes her life so compelling in this morbid way?<br /><br />Though 'Monster' does not give the definite answer, it still attempts to shed a light on the life of this serial killer in terms of her relations to another woman named Selby (Christina Ricci).  As you know, Charlize Theron gives very convincing acting as Aileen who finds a hope of life in this lonely girl, which turns out short-lived and more pernicious than she at first imagined.<br /><br />The story is surprisingly simple.  Aileen meets Selby at a bar, and Selby, knowing that her relation with Aileen would be looked down as indecent by her father and relatives, keeps on meeting her, and fell for her.  Finally Selby leaves the home, and begins a new life with Aileen, but later she comes to realize that Aileen killed a guy, and she just cannot stop killing men, even the totally innocent ones.<br /><br />Don't try to seek 'truths' about the killer and her life.  The strength of 'Monster' lies more in its obviously fictionalized (so I believe) part of Aileen who seeks desperately something in life, than in the reveiled facts themselves, which the film hardly has.  The film leaves out many things -- such as Aileen's marriage, and at least one killing is depicted as self-defence (as the real Aileen claimed) -- but whether or not you trust that part, it's up to you.  Me?  Not at all.<br /><br />The unremarkable script (which is full of predictable turns) works simply because it is supported by two good acting from Theron and Ricci.  Though Theron underwent a physical change with make-ups and special diet, it is her performance that makes the film compelling.<br /><br />The film is at its best when it describes Aileen's incredibly naive outlook on life, which plays one of the basic part of the whole story.  The idea of showing that aspect of her is original, but otherwise the film itself is not as great as many critics' raving reviews would lead us to think.  And as to Ms. Theron's prosthetics, well, I guess it's time to stop that trick.  Like Nicole Kidman who won the Oscar 'by the nose,' and whose career suddenly started to look unimpressive, I think it brings a bad luck.  And have you ever seen 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers' or 'Head in the Clouds' both of which feature Charlize Theron, and went nowhere?</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>There is an indistinct moment during MONSTER when Charlize Theron does disappear into the role of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. You stop looking at Charlize Theron and thinking of how she transformed herself so completely. You stop watching the mannerisms she's given her character and the way she has her talk. You stop spending the film separating the actor and the role, and you just become engrossed in the film and in the flawed reasoning and psychology of a disturbed, sad killer. <p>When that happens, MONSTER begins to work really well.<p>Well-acted by Theron and Christina Ricci in the vein of MONSTER'S BALL and BOYS DON'T CRY, it's not a perfect film, but it's certainly a provocative one. You begin to actually sympathize with Wuornos and her history of abuse. Though her acts are irredeemable, several audience members did weep for her at the screening I attended. Discussions afterward were plentiful, asking questions about how much Wuornos was a creature of her environment and how much she was just a killer. It's a tremendous accomplishment that MONSTER generated that kind of response.<br /><br />The screenplay does pull some punches, though. Some of Aileen's earlier actions and statements are too contrived. The film makes one of Aileen's more sympathetic johns a stutterer so that the audience will immediately feel for him. At one point, to demonize a supporting character, the screenplay has her utter an out-of-place obscenity which leads the audience to immediately hate her. <p>On the whole, though, MONSTER is a very good film with a great performance carrying it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>Makes you wonder why people are allowed to have children, and how many thousands of would be Aileen's that are becoming teenagers.  When the young Aileen told her father she was being molested by one of his jerk-off friends and dear old dad didn't believe her and the guy kept on molesting her.  That was were she got her low self esteem and thoughts of being worthless.  I guess if we lived in a world where people were driven by logic and reason instead of power and greed couples would be tested to see if they could physically and mentally cope with the unrelenting stress of parenthood.  But, that would be too easy.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Upon renting this movie, I expected something along the lines of "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer," with some psychology and some serial killin'.  I was surprised to find very little actual killin' in this film, and a whole lot of psychology.  This movie is a character study, not a plot-driven narrative.  As such, it provides Charlize Theron with a real actor's showcase.  She takes full advantage of it, turning in a fantastic performance.  Christina Ricci does a fine job, too.  Given that we spend most of the movie with these two, their performances are critical, and they bring it strong.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this movie was its lack of plot.  It meandered around a bit much for me, and became a little tedious in points.  Also, it was a little too sympathetic to Wuornos.  It's clear how she got to where she was, but she is portrayed as a complete victim who at no point (well, perhaps one) has any control over her choices.<br /><br />"Monster" is at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Gritty drama and true story about the story of Aileen Wuornos.  I was completely impressed by the incredible acting and story telling.  How they made the lovely Charlize Theron look so unbecoming is remarkable and she completely nailed the part of Aileen.  Ricci was just as good an actress and deserved some recognition.<br /><br />There was nothing fancy or beautified about this movie at all. It was edgy, a bit raw and very straight forward.  All the more convincing and a highly recommended watch.  No sympathizing here with Aileen, just the straight story telling of her life and her tragic end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>For starters, Charlize Theron gives a landmark performance as serial-killer Aileen Wuornos as the Oscar and other testimonials will attest to.  Her performance is not all make-up, prosthetics and weight gain.  Theron gets inside the skin of this used and abused and ultimately evil individual.  Christina Ricci matches her as her naive lover and unwitting accomplice.  Also, any film that features Bruce Dern, albeit in a smallish role, is aces in my book.  As tawdry as the tale here is, it is not done in an exploitative manner.  That said, this is not the type of film I care to re-visit very often.  It's a compelling yet not very pleasurable experience.  If you have to see one serial killer movie, then this is probably the one to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>There's little that can be added to this forum regarding the Oscar-winning "Monsters".  Theron is unbelievably both grotesquely repulsive yet appealing as Aileen Wuornos, a woman that a "monstrous" society shaped.  Ricci, as always, is in fine form as Wuornos' companion.  After appearing frequently in films of late, it's refreshing to see Bruce Dern as Aileen's supportive friend.<br /><br />As I watched the film, I found myself in awe of the lengths that Miss Theron took in tackling this role, turning her strikingly beautiful good looks into something unrecognizable yet totally captivating.<br /><br />The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences got this one dead on the mark when it awarded the actress with its coveted "Best Actress" Oscar.<br /><br />It would've been a greater honor if director Jenkins had won, too!</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>A sympathetic story about a hooker from Florida with lesbian instincts.

Aside from the first murder, which even in the evidence presented in court, was shown to have been committed in self defense after a savage rape, the film does show that eventually Wuornos killed for the money. Or did she?<p>  The reason i feel that this film does a good (but not quite great) job of going below the surface is because it shows us this woman's life without resorting to cheap sensationalism and without overstating or understating anything. This woman, like many 1000s, or even millions of people, basically live in that fringe of our society that resembles hell. She acquired street wits in the process but she also acquired brutal hopelessness, terminal despair, and ultimately distrust for anyone around her.<p>  When she gets in an affair with Selby, this relationship becomes to her the only way to exit the giant toilet bowl she virtually lives in. Problem was, like with many other things in life, she had no clue how. In her particular case, the fact that she wound up killing for a mere $200 shows what type of despair we're talking about. It's an old argument really, but one that wont go away no matter how hypocritically some of us choose to look at things, that is: anybody in our societies, "good" or "bad" is a direct product of that society. And that's undeniable, noone drops suddenly from the sky and lives amongst us.<br />  The character in "Monster" eventually comes to the point to treat people as she was treated. Yes, noone killed her physically (except the state in the end) but she had been morally and mentally "murdered" countless times before she turned into a murderer herself. <p>  Charlize Theron is incredible not because she took on 40 pounds and was made ugly to play this film, but because she stunningly managed to portray the mess in this woman's soul. That's the part of her acting that gave her the Oscar, which by the way - I felt- was one Oscar well deserved after a long, long time.<br />  But the same counts for the director of the film who manages to capture a life between rainy highways and back seats of cars, filthy apartments, sleazy bars with other hopeless characters, and ultimately a vast scape of nothingness. That's where the "Monster" was bred in and lived in.<p>  As for those who might've been offended with the film's language or the themes presented in it, well that's a true paradox, because that's like admitting that reality offends them. Sure, one can choose to avoid reality, but that never really works in the long run as "what's there" eventually -and always- catches up with us no matter what medium we use to avoid it.<p>  "Monster" is a truly good film, and in my opinion, whatever objections can be raised are either trivial or hypocritical.<br />  C.Theron is not the only one giving a great performance by the way. Christina Ricci is up to par with her even if this goes "unnoticed" as Theron's role is inevitably overshadowing.<br />  A film that intimidates with its rawness and its ultra-realism, "Monster" is one that wont let you easily forget it. Nor should you, if you ask me...</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>There is an old literary and cinematic adage that great monsters evoke both pity and terror. By that standard, Charlize Theron makes a magnificent monster as serial killer Aileen Wuornos; by any standard Theron's performance in Patty Jenkins' "Monster" must stand as one of the most courageous and emotionally naked in recent memory. The beautiful Theron deglamorized herself severely to play Wuornos, a "highway hooker" who in the movie is driven to madness and murder by a combination of family rejection, grinding poverty, abusive johns and her hopeless love for a young girl (played persuasively by Christina Ricci). But is this the way it really happened? Sue Russell, a freelance journalist and author of a book about Wuornos, faults the movie among other things for not showing that Wuornos' murderous temper, in fact, first showed itself in childhood, long before the events of the movie. Russell also points out that while Wuornos probably was raped several times, it is highly doubtful that any of the johns she murdered were among her rapists. While these are important points, there is no denying that Wuornos' situation was dire, and not entirely of her own making. Wuornos is already a desperate character when we first see her, taking shelter from the rain under a highway overpass and contemplating suicide. Theron brilliantly evokes Wuornos' mental disintegration; toward the end, still talking up her dreams, her eyes are as blank and expressionless as a shark's. "Monster" isn't exactly pleasant viewing, but thanks to Jenkins' craftsmanship and Theron's performance, it keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. No movie since "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" has painted such a riveting portrait of a killer's pathology as "Monster."</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Obviously, to praise Monster is not to condone the behavior of people such as Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) and Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) portrayed in this film. The same can also be said of other films such as In Cold Blood and Bonnie and Clyde. The film is an art form. To me at least, the objective as a reviewer is to comment as honestly and as thoughtfully as possible on any film as a work of art. Having recently seen Monster and then City of God, I view both as works of great art. Hence my Five Star rating of each. This review is composed prior to the announcement of those who are to receive Academy Awards. Either Theron or Diane Keaton would be a worthy recipient as best actress in a leading role but my preference is Theron. She commands our attention from her first to last appearance on screen. For me, she IS Wuornos. Moreover, I cannot recall another a character in another film whom she resembles. As portrayed by Theron, Wuornos is passionate, delusional, pathetic, frightening, vulnerable, and on occasion touching. I never expect to understand fully (or even partially) why Aileen Wuornos -- in real life, not in the film -- behaved as she did. Too much happened -- and did not happen -- in her life which is not revealed or even implied in this film. Who is the "monster"? Is it Wuornos? Is it the society into which she was born and within which she evolved to womanhood? Whom to blame? What to blame? Should any blame be assigned, other than responsibility for the murders committed? To repeat, I do NOT condone the behavior portrayed in this film even as I admire so much what Patty Jenkins achieves as director as well as the achievements of her cast and crew. For 109 minutes, I was fully engaged in -- not merely watching -- human experiences wholly unrelated to anything I had ever experienced in my own life. Perhaps this is what a film makes possible...and a movie does not. Perhaps therein is the difference between art and artifact. As these comments no doubt suggest, I am still absorbing and digesting what I have seen. This much I do know: I will never forget my brief visit to Aileen Wuornos' world but have no desire to return to it .</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Is it simply a potrait or a posthumous appeal with a subject convenient enough to include enough violence and gore to make Hollywood-smitten fans line up? The film is such a dense, compelling story with amazing performances that it leaves you asking WHY its protagonist was driven to commit those highway murders..<p>Not that "Monster" asks us to feel sorry for Wuornos, a Florida prostitute who killed seven men in the 1980s. The director asks only that we try to understand her. Theron's performance reveals a confused young woman who became a prostitute at 13 after being continually raped by her father's best friend and then being blamed and beaten by her father when he found out. <p>As a movie that attempts to psychoanalyzes a serial killer's idiosynchracies, this movie is nowhere near some of the better classics (e.g., the Hannibal Lecter series, Midnight Cowboy, Badlands etc etc) but it is an interesting, well-made potrayal of the real-life Wuornos. I was intrigued to the point of googling for Wuronos and found that www.crimelibrary.com/serial4/wuornos/ has some good information that dispels the hyperbole surrounding this disturbed character. <p>Theron's performance is of course brave and tortured. But I was even more impressed with Ricci, whose mannerisms aren't as noticeable. Her subtle performance as Wuornos' pathetically optimistic girlfriend comes closer to breaking the heart.<p>Despite knowing the denouement -- Aileen Wuornos is such a known quantity that we do know where she's going (death row) -- it's the sense of utter unpredictability that makes "Monster" so gripping.

It is a sad, brutal story about the unfortunate lives of two women who find solace in each other, and their struggle for survival leads to a murder spree that produced America's first female serial killer. <p>Based on the true account of Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), her sad story will grip you from the beginning. She was a prostitute from the age of 13, and has led the hardest of lives. She has never known love, affection, and has lived on a wing and a prayer. The real life Wuornos claimed to have slept with over 250,000 men in her lifetime. One night, she meets a young kindred spirit named Selby (Christina Ricci). She lives under slightly better circumstances, but still feels detached from the rest of society, being a lesbian in a strictly religious family. What blossoms is a love story between these two girls. Wuornos is not a lesbian per-se, but she is smitten with Selby, who is the first person to love her for who she really is, and not treat her like trash and cast her aside. One fateful encounter with a vicious john and potential killer turns the tide. Wuornos kills a john who has beat and raped her, and if given the chance, would have killed her. This starts her down a pit with greasy sides, and she takes to the streets and kills as many johns who will pick her up. Her motives are both money and survival, for her and Selby, who is na?ve and squeamish but willing to play along. Her initial killing was justifiable, and the audience will empathize with her for it, but the murders that ensue become more and more senseless. <p>"Monster" is not a morality tale, nor does it condone or condemn the crimes Wuornos commits. It tells the story of one life that started in the gutter and never quite crawled out. Wuornos is a character who is both physically and personally unattractive, drunk and mouthy throughout most of the movie, but you cannot help but feel sadness for her, though you don't forgive her for the crimes she commits. The Selby character is the Yin to the Yang in this case. She is much younger than Wuornos, and while open about her homosexuality, she is still confused and somewhat disillusioned about the world around her. She is in it for the love and security, while Wuornos is surprised that she can love at all after the life she's lived.<p>There has been much buzz about Charlize Theron's powerhouse performance, so much that it has overshadowed every other aspect of the movie. The hype, however, is very much deserved. Theron doesn't just play the part, she becomes it. She plays with honesty and conviction that we rarely see in performances nowadays. Even more shocking is how she has transformed for the role. The makeup effects aside (which add 10 years to her life), she gained 30 pounds for the role, and her physical appearances suggest countless rapes, beatings, and the ravages of hard living and consumption. The transformation has to be seen to be believed. Christina Ricci has only gotten better with age, and while this role is more subdued than her best (The Opposite of Sex leaps to mind), she is fantastic as always. <p>What I respect most about "Monster" is that it is not overly dramatic in trying to humanize some pretty nasty characters, nor does it pander to the typical Hollywood clich&eacute;s. Having said that, it is also doesn't pull any punches. The violence and rape scenes will leave scars on more sensitive viewers, but even the most dismissive viewers cannot deny the impact of this movie, and the performance of Theron will stand as one of the best female lead roles in recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>I sometimes wonder why more people can't be nice. I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children. Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim. In a perfect world everyone would be happy. In a perfect world no one would ever want. In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER. It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.<p>MONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid. It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row. Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all. You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute. But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.<p>The woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself. At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine. She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her. <p>But one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed. If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.<p>MONSTER is not a happy film. It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end. You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself. I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me. Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road. For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off. What if I was in Aileen's situation? Would I do the same thing? I would hope not, but hey you never know.<p>If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's. For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women. Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly. This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing. She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.<p>I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern . His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen. While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture. <p>The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life. What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that. But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable. But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past. <p>MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart. It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic. I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film. While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>"Monster" is the heartwarming story of one Aileen Wuornos, a rough and tumble gal who killed a bunch of guys in Florida back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eventually the cops got wise to the fact that the person bumping these chaps off was probably one of the numerous harridans roaming the highways and byways looking for johns. The authorities eventually hauled in Wuornos and got a confession, tried her for capital murder, and executed her about three years ago. End of story. Well, not according to writer/director Patty Jenkins. She thought Wuornos's tale of woe would make for a great movie, and thus "Monster" arrived on the scene last year to great acclaim. Thanks in large part to the shocking metamorphosis of lead actress Charlize Theron, the movie grabbed a lot of attention in all corners. Moreover, the film is notable because someone in Hollywood managed to make a film about a social outcast that didn't cover the subject with retch-inducing sycophancy. There aren't any heroes in "Monster," and while the picture tries to garner some sympathy for the despicable Wuornos, it never attempts to justify the horrible actions committed by this loathsome serial killer--at least not that much, anyway.<br /><br />One look at Aileen Wuornos ought to make any sane person head for the hills, but surprisingly many different types of guys pick her up on the side of the road. This works well for the woman since her appearance and rough manner virtually ensures that she can't find adequate employment anywhere else, at least not the sort of work that she could use to support herself. Indeed, one part of the film documents Wuornos's attempts to leave her ugly past behind in order to find a decent job only to find rejection awaits her at every stop. Anyway, her life suddenly takes on new meaning thanks to two major events. First, she meets a young woman with serious personal issues, Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), in a bar and the two strike up an odd relationship. Wuornos is just what this young girl is looking for, primarily an escape from the fundamentalist relatives her father sent her to after exhibiting questionable behavior up in Ohio. Second, Wuornos kills a john after the guy nearly kills her on an abandoned road. Needing to move on for a time to avoid potential problems with the police, Aileen eventually convinces Selby to tag along.<br /><br />The two move through a string of scuzzy hotels and run down shacks before settling in a fairly nice house. But there are problems, mainly Selby's need to meet people outside the relationship and her ever so subtle manipulations of Wuornos's frail ego. Afraid of losing Selby and with her absence the only sense of love she's ever felt in her life, Wuornos not only continues but also escalates her vicious rampages. She starts offing any of the patrons who pick her up even when it is clearly obvious they have no intention of physically harming her. Wuornos then sells off the men's cars for the cash needed to keep her girlfriend satisfied. It's really a sick relationship made even worse by the fact that Selby knows what's going on and refuses to put a stop to it. Oh, she goes through the motions, crying and screaming and asking her beloved "Lee" what is going on, but she always comes back for more. And why not? Every so often Wuornos shows up with a wad of cash and takes care of everything. That Selby will eventually turn on her lover when the cops come a knockin' should be a foregone conclusion.<br /><br />While I don't fully agree with others who have said that "Monster" overly sympathizes with its subject, there is evidence of such objectionable behavior in the script. We don't know what Aileen Wuornos really said or did when she killed her victims, so presenting her as crying and remorseful even as she drops the hammer on a victim is a bit of a stretch--especially when it's more than obvious that by this point she is killing solely to make money. But getting something out of the film doesn't really rely on agreeing or disagreeing with how Jenkins depicts her subject as much as it does on the amazing performance turned in by Charlize Theron. An incredibly beautiful woman by any standard, the actress undergoes an incredible transformation to play the pasty faced, obese Aileen Wuornos. She's got everything down, from the woman's voice to her posture and body language. If you don't believe such a thing possible, try and find a documentary or crime show on the real Wuornos and then watch the movie. It's quite remarkable, actually, and very disturbing as well. The only time I could tell I was looking at Theron occurred when she smiled, but other than that we might as well be staring into the late Aileen Wuornos's mug. Scary.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras, primarily a couple of short featurettes explaining how Jenkins and Theron conducted research into the character and one outlining how the film score came about. No commentary track, surprisingly, but that will probably arrive when someone releases the collector's edition, super duper special feature two disc compilation delivered to your home by Theron herself wearing her Wuornos get up. I heartily recommend "Monster," and would watch it again if given the chance. It reeks of nihilism, contains some of the finest acting I've seen this year, and deals with subject matter most filmgoers avoid like the plague.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Monster (Patty Jenkins, 2003)<p>Forget the rest of the Oscar race for Best Actress. Charlize Theron has won the trophy hands-down with her portrayal of Florida's iron lady, serial killer Aileen Wuornos, in Patty Jenkins' amazing debut film Monster.<p>Monster is a biopic about the last months of Wuornos' freedom, from the time of her meeting with "Selby Wall" (Christina Ricci; her real-life counterpart had a different name) until the time of her arrest and trial, during which Wuornos, a highway prostitute, killed seven johns. And that, in a nutshell, is the plot. As far as biopics go, really, there's not much here you haven't seen before plotwise.<p>But the reason to see it, and I tell you you must see it now, is the ugly, painful depths of emotion to be found throughout the film. Theron's performance has already received lavish praise, all of it deserved. Less noted, but perhaps even finer, is the performance of Christina Ricci, whose character transforms from straight-up God-fearing closeted lesbian into a sneering carbon copy of Wuornos in subtle ways throughout the film, making the irony of the film's ending twist just a little further into the gut. Great supporting roles are also turned in by Bruce Dern and a number of cameos.<p>Despite the questions raised by the film, another thing that makes it brilliant is its refusal to pander to any particular group, something which it could very easily have done on many levels. There's no gay-acceptance subtext. There's no anti-death-penalty subtext. There's the allegation, which I have never seen before in any media treatment of Wuornos, that the seven murders were not all in self defense. (About time, too.) There's brilliant and beautiful irony laced throughout the film, and all of it played perfectly. The film walks on the edges of a whole lot of knives, and the balancing act it performs is masterful.<p>Roger Ebert called Monster the best film of 2003. I haven't seen quite as many movies as he has (oh, to have such a job), but of the lot that I've come across, I am more than happy to agree. Monster is a brilliant film, it is an important film, and it is a film you cannot see fast enough. Turn off the computer, get in your car, and go to the theater. Now. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Monster tells the story of Aileen Wuornos , a vagabond prostitute and one of America's first female serial killers. The film picks up just before she begins the killing spree that claimed the lives of nine men, many clients of the enterprising lady-of-the-night, murdered in cars or deep in the woods where they were to partake in her services.<br /><br />The director of the film (Patty Jenkins) uses the life of Wournos to comment on what she sees as the evils of contemporary society. But the target of Jenkins's film is not the killer, but rather a society that the film suggests led Wuornos to commit her crimes. The true villains of the world (according to Jenkins) are not serial killers, but rather capitalism, patriarchy and homophobia. These are the true "monsters" of the film, as they are the real reason nine men died at the hands of our hero.<br /><br />OK, maybe calling her the film's "hero" is a bit of a stretch, but the film does work very hard trying to add humanity to a woman who (let me say this again) murdered nine men. Her childhood is sad, her dreams are shattered, and she can't get a real job because her only previous employment consisted of wanking winkies. Therefore, the only thing left for her to do is...start killing people.<br /><br />What I see as dangerous about this movie is that it is indeed based on a real woman and nearly all the facts in the film are true. But this film shows how a write/director can use facts to produce a thesis that doesn't necessarily grow naturally from the story itself. Many people will walk away from this film buying the ideas that drive the film, because (they will say) it is based on fact and must be true.<br /><br />In the hands of a less "enlightened" director, the film would portray a very different Aileen Wuornos. Rather than pointing criticism out at the world around her, a more responsible filmmaker would force the criticism to point back at the star of the film, the monstrous Aileen Wuornos.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>The really interesting story of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Well directed story that makes you feel sorry and despise Aileen.  Charlize Theron give the performance of her life.  Putting on a bunch of weight, false teeth, greasy hair and no makeup, you might not even recognize her.  Beside the physical portion, she really becomes Aileen.  I can't say enough good things about her.  If not for anything else, you must watch this film for her performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>This is a brutally told but compelling version of the Aileen Wuornos story.  She was a deranged psycho, sure, but Charlize Theron's "monster" performance also allowed us an insider's view into the woman and her troubled past.  While there can be no excusing her actions, this movie makes it possible at least to understand why she turned to prostitution, and then ultimately to murder.<br /><br />Christina Ricci is also excellent as the lonely lesbian who befriends Wuornos, and inadvertently, at least at first, sparks the violence that rages within Wuornos' troubled mind.  As the story unfolds however, the tough hooker becomes putty-like in the hands of the disatisfied, nagging girlfriend, falling deeper and deeper into trouble, in an effort to buy happiness for their most unlikely partnership.<br /><br />While certainly disturbing and at times depressing, you'll find yourself unable to turn away, even though you already know how this story ends.<br /><br />To assist the people who are watching this movie for the ...ummm.. "Cinematic experience", your chapters are six and fifteen on the DVD, and your new favorite song is "Crimson and Clover".<br /><br />Well performed and directed, and thoroughly deserving of all the awards that have been heaped on it.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 26, 2004</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>About half-way through, I wasn't sure if this was really all that it had been cracked up to be, but rest assured, after viewing it in its entirety, it certainly is worthy of the praise that it has recieved.<br /><br /> Having studied Aileen Wournos a bit in school, I came to the conclusion that she was a sick piece of trash, conjured up from some sewer. This film did not change my opinion of her, but it did succeed, however in painting a poignant picture of a human being transforming into a complete monster. To some it may seem that the makers of this are trying to convince the viewer that Wournos was a victim of circumstance, had no choice, but I don't think that is the case. The facts concerning Aileen's rampage of terror are portrayed with accuracy, her personality is captured by the brilliant Charlize Therzon. It is as if the viewer were a member of the jury, walking along with Aileen, being presented with the story firsthand, without the lawyers bickering back and forth, and not having to worry about undue sympathy being evoked.<br /><br /> If this movie had been some feminist war-cry, then I, being the sentimental sucker that I am, most likely would have been convinced that Ailleen was misunderstood, etc. But that was not the case. I think that monster got exactly what she deserved (along with her first victim). To sum it up: Great Film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>You don't gain much by watching a film like this, other than the fact you can realize your crappy life isn't really so bad after all. The performance by Charlize Theron is truly one of the best ever on film by an actress. I had know idea she could act until I saw this brutal portrayal of this killer with my own eyes. She deserved her Oscar easily. I also thought Christina Ricci was very good too as Selby, her sidekick and partner. Rent this movie and watch it once. It is well made, but I doubt many can stomach this fairly disturbing film more than a couple of times. And who would want to?</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I went to see "Monster" because there is so much talk of Charlize getting the Oscar this year. And yes, her performance does deserve it. She is totally convincing as this mass-murderer.<br />I also thought Christina Ricci deserved an award nomination as well for her role as the shy naive girlfriend.<br />However, I left the movie theatre feeling like I needed a shower.  The violence is pretty shocking and stomach-turning. I know this is a true story, but I wish the film makers would have taken a slightly different route to telling the story. Maybe they felt they needed to show the murder scenes as realistically as possible to show exactly what happened.<br />It is sad to think what happened to Ailleen could happen to any person - her life was such a horrible disaster. Charlize portrays this perfectly, and I hope she gets the Oscar for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>A bulked up and chunky Charlize Theron is mesmerizing in her stunning and somewhat sympathetic portrayal of hard case Florida highway prostitute and executed serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Beaten and abused as a child Wuornos turns to turning tricks early on and essentially grows up on the streets.<p>She meets Selby, played wonderfully by Christina Ricci, a sexually conflicted young woman in a bar in Florida and they soon become lesbian lovers.  Theron vows to support her and show her the good life.  With no marketable workplace skills she reverts to prostitution to make some money.  While servicing a john she gets manacled and savagely beaten.  She manages to free herself and in a justifiable homicide, shoots and kills the pervert with a gun she'd been carrying.  She robs his money and car.<p>With pressure on Theron to support Ricci financially her mind takes a severe psychological twist.<p>Theron in her defining role shows awesome acting ability, far beyond her previous efforts.  The scope of her performance overshadows that of Ricci who was also noteworthy.  Bruce Dern, in a supporting role is his usual creepy self.Kudos to the makeup artist who transformed the gorgeous Theron into the tough looking dark rooted blonde that was Wuornos.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Whenever I suggest an acting performance worthy of an Oscar, it's understood that my recommendation is debatable. Not so Charlize Theron's tour de force in MONSTER, which transcends argumentative discussion. It's the performance of this decade, and perhaps any decade you'd care to mention. If it doesn't win her the Academy Award for best actress in a leading role, then there's no justice and the Oscars will forever lose all credibility with me. No other performance by a female actor in 2003 comes even close. Not Kidman, not Johansson, not Keaton, or anyone else you'd be tempted to mention. And I'll even sell down the river my personal favorite, Cate Blanchett.<p>In January 1991, aging prostitute Aileen Wuornos was arrested in Florida. She was suspected of killing seven men since 1989, leaving their bullet-riddled bodies near highways, and stealing their cars and cash. In January 1992, Wuornos was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, mostly on the evidence of her own confessions and the testimony of her lesbian lover during the killing spree, Tyria Moore. In October 2002, the state took her life. MONSTER is Aileen's story.<p>Even a cursory reading of the Wuornos tragedy on the Web will indicate the challenge of Charlize's incredibly taxing role. It's not just the make-up (shaved eyebrows, false teeth), body alteration (thirty pounds added weight), and costumes that the actress put on for the role. It's the walk, talk, nervous mannerisms and body language. Even aura, if you believe in such. Theron is unrecognizable as herself. The transformation is apocalyptically stunning.<p>The film does, of course, take liberties. Tyria Moore, 24-years old when she met Wuornos in 1986, becomes "Selby" (Christina Ricci), who's about 18 in the script. The screenplay inferred to me a time span of perhaps several months for the Aileen-Selby relationship, and that the first killing occurred about when the two first met. In fact, Aileen and Tyria spent four years together, and the first murder was committed only towards the end. In any case, Ricci deserves consideration for an Oscar in a supporting role as the troubled, naive, and clueless Selby totally out of her depth.<p>At one point, Theron's Aileen states that she was raped by her father's friends, and that he subsequently beat her for it. In fact,  Aileen's real-life mother divorced Leo Dale Pittman a couple months before her daughter's birth and Aileen never met her natural father. Aileen and a brother were subsequently raised by their maternal grandparents, Lauri and Britta Wuornos. The grandfather drank heavily and was physically abusive. Aileen engaged in pre-marital sex at an early age, and was pregnant at 14. After giving her child up for adoption, she ran away from home to take up hitchhiking and prostitution. While MONSTER doesn't excuse Aileen for her the murders she later committed, it reveals Wuornos for the emotionally and psychologically tortured casualty of life that she was and who, in the end, "volunteered" for the death penalty. In this case, execution may have been a mercy.<p>MONSTER gives evil a human face, a fact that will undoubtedly cause discomfiture in some critics who believe in a morally black and white world.<p>MONSTER isn't an easy presentation to watch. As the film unwound and the power of Theron's performance washed over me in waves, I found myself sliding lower and lower into my seat. The rape scene that sets Aileen on her murderous path is vicious. And it doesn't get any easier with the individual killings, especially the last when any vestige of sympathy the audience might have for Wuornos is forfeit. Based solely on the intensity of the subject matter, MONSTER goes up against HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG as arguably the Best Picture of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This movie shows the vulnerability of humanity at it's best. It is based on a true story of a psychopathic mass murderer. It is also a story about one woman taking advantage of another at thier weakest moment when she was down. This is not a pleasant story nor is it a happy one. It is an important story because it is a true story that could have happened to anyone at thier weakest moment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>This movie is loosely based on the life story of Aileen Wournos, a serial killer who was executed a few years ago for her crimes. Aileen decides that since she can't get a legitimate job she has no choice but to be a prostitute. I think that Aileen should have taken a good hard look in the mirror before deciding on that career path. This movie tries to elicit sympathy for Aileen's plight but all I felt was very sorry for her victims. I seems that Aileen had yet to realize that you can't resolve a bad past by using violence in the present.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>...for the director and to Theron for her amazing transformation, but to me there's something not right about how Hollywood folks will be rewarded for such a heartbreaking true story. While I cannot condone what Wournos did, and while many folks will say she got what she deserved, to me it was quite obvious that she needed help that society refused to give or just could not give. (Particularly so in Jeb Bush's Florida.) The movie allows us to look at how a Aileen Wournos could be created and makes us take a look of our own humanity--or lack of humanity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>Hollywood and its baby brother on the indy front have decided they don't want to make movies that mean anything anymore. They have decided, like an overbearingly pompous mother, just what is good for us. Gone are the days of films like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Apostle, The Shawshank Redemption and other films that changed our movie habits forever. They do, however, have a newfound liking for films that empathize with characters caught in a nigthmarish hell and that seize our emotions and shatter them like glass. I'm sorry if I sound the part of a simpleton here, but nihilism is getting tiresome.<br /><br />In Monster, the empathy for a woman who, although having things done to her so heinous that I felt sick at the thought of the miscreants who hurt her, still seems to scream at us - in the films theme, that is - that it's not really her fault that she now kills people. It was the fault of the rapist who molested her at age of eight. It was the fault of the man who rapes her when she starts "hooking." It was the fault of society. It wasn't her fault when she takes an innocent man out to a field and shoots in in the back of the head.<br /><br />I hated when the film started to twist its ugly, but nowadays predictably thematic head. Another gem of a "thinking" film was at it again, bringing forth all its pretention and presumption along with it. The message, escorted handsomely by numerous awards for Therin and the film, told us, "If you village dwellers don't grasp our statement here, you probably adore films like  The Wedding Planner and Racing Stripes."<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />I got the theme and I almost puked all over myself. I can empathize with a woman who's been pained by a terrible childhood and life - both of my parents have lived through nightmarish hells as children and grown into people who love others without condition - but I will not empathize with that woman when she decides to keep the cycle of hell going by taking life.<br /><br />I would have liked to have watched a film about the family of the innocent man who is killed in the field. I would have enjoyed that very much, being that it would be an honest balance. But alas, you will never see that. Curse these film gurus for dishing it out so one-sidedly.<br /><br />I assume many of you will dismiss my opinion but for those of you who have doubts, save yourself from washing off the vomit and the unwanted influx of tears from your already tattered movie shirt.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>The film follows the life Aileen Wuornos( Charlize Theron), a female prostitute, who in the 1980's and the 1990's, kills 7 different men over the course of months. It also shows a relationship she had at the time with a woman (Christina Ricci) and how the murders tore their relationship apart.<br /><br />Depressing. That is the first word that went into my head after I got up and left the cinema when I went to see this back in 2003. I also felt digust and had a sense of being dirty. In the car, I didn't speak about it to my companion that was feeling the same thing that I was. The film hits the mark dead on with the feelings and the emotions and the acting. When you are done with this movie, you walk out of it feeling "Why did I see that?" because it is one of the darkest stories I have ever seen told on the screen. It makes you feel bad. It just makes your skin crawl over. There is not a single bone in my body that was creeped out by what I had seen in that.<br /><br />Patty Jenkins, for a first time director, introduces nothing new to the film world. She has so-so direction that is highlighted by Theron's amazing transformation into Wuornos. The only way that a person can say they got something out of the film was to look at Theron's performance and say "that is the only good thing, her performance." The reason why the film was critically acclaimed was by her performance, and performance only. The performance was what set the film. You weren't watching the other actors take their turn. You were watching Theron in awe as she displays the sickening life of the murder that she was ask to portray. The writing itself was mediocre and was all over the place, it took Theron's character and developed her the most while leaving other characters with little or no development at all. Like I said, it was a star making vehicle for Charlize Theron like Risky Business was for Tom Cruise or The Hustler was for Paul Newman. The film focuses mostly on Theron and never lets up.<br /><br />Theron's performance was amazing, in a word. She takes the character and develops the mannerisms of the person and the personality also. She makes you hate and feel for her at the same time the development of the character shows towards the end of the film when Aileen looks back in desperation of getting a last glimpse of her lover.<br /><br />Overall, the film make me depressed, but I was in awe of Charlize's performance and was glad that she won the Oscar for it, because before this, she really hadn't impressed me with her other films as they hadn't any challenging roles that she could free herself in as a actress. Decent film, amazing performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>Monster is a remarkable movie and not just for the obvious artistic reasons.  For one thing, it shows just how degrading lesbianism is.  More importantly, it goes against the feminist position that women should only be portrayed as being victims, not criminals in their own right.  In feminist movies, there are no such things as femme fatales.  All women are depicted as being helpless victims at the hands of evil males.<br /><br />Monster reminds us that there are evil women, such as Aileen Wuornos, who are capable of the most fiendish things, including violence against men.  For this reason alone, Monster is a most remarkable movie that completely goes against the feminist grain.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>"Monster" focuses on the true life story of a woman named Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron). Aileen became a prostitute at the age of thirteen. However, years later she is growing tired of the life and is struggling to find a reason to go on living. That is until she meets a woman who is a lesbian named Selby (Christina Ricci). The two become friends, and the relationship eventually takes a romantic turn. Aileen tries to straighten her life out and make an honest living to support Selby and herself. Unfortunately, after an endless search for jobs, her only alternative is to go back to being a prostitute. Things take a turn for the worse however, when Aileen begins to murder her clientele.<p>Before watching Monster, I was very excited to see the film because of how much praise Charlize Theron was receiving for her performance. Theron gives one of the best performances I have ever seen. She literally transformed herself into Aileen Wuornos. Everything from her violent attitude and the way that she talked, to the physical characteristics of the character. Charlize is an extremely beautiful woman in real life, and she looked down right hideous in the film. The physical change alone was shocking. However, the reason I can only give Monster three stars is because the movie did not have much else going for it. While the interpretation of events were accurate, the movie was boring overall, and Christina Ricci's character Selby came off as an annoying, whining, hypocrite. For example, Selby complains that there is no money coming in, and she convinces Aileen to go back to being a prostitute. Then when she starts hooking again, Selby cries and complains that Aileen is never around.<p>If Charlize Theron had not starred in Monster, it would not be worth watching. It is a shame, that a performance so good, was wasted on such a bad film. However, Theron's performance is so incredible, that it somehow lets you endure the film and marvel at her brilliance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Monster may have been a passable film had it been good art, or at least attempted to portray the true story of Aileen Wuornos. Instead, it fails miserably on both scores, content to have an ABC Afterschool Special like patina in its approach. I also, after viewing this film, know another reason why I wanted to not see it, and that's because after two years of this unjust and wasteful war of invasion President Bush launched in Iraq I did not want to be reminded that sometimes even the reactionary Right Wing Radicals can still be right about something; and that is only a deluded out of touch Hollywood Feminazi sympathizers could serve up such crap, and then fete it ceaselessly. This is one of those films and performances that in ten or so years people will cringe at as being one of the worst selections ever. Let me be the first to say it- Theron's award winning performance is one of the worst to ever win an Oscar- it is not deep, nor scary, and even lacks the essential redeeming silliness of a Hannibal Lecter or Freddy Krueger. This film is one of those that people are just agog at, and so at odds with the Hollywood machine and its fawning parade of acolyte critics, that no one has the guts to say it's terrible. And, worst of all, every time I think about the film, and Theron's performance, it slides down another notch in my mind, just like so-called feminists who see a hero in Aileen Wuornos. That said, the Monster referred to in the title of the film most aptly applies to the film itself. Avoid this tripe!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Charlize Theron is simply amazing in this engrossing, fact-based thriller. She is extremely convincing as serial killer Aileen Wuornos, giving a haunting and well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. The otherwise gorgeous star transforms into the not so gorgeous killer and gives a very eerie and sympathetic performance. I was wowed.<p>Charlize Theron may rule the film, but the always wonderful Christina Ricci is very good as well, playing her love interest Selby. She brings an immature vulnerability and wide-eyed innocence to her character and pulls a real person out of what could be just a ball of insecurities.<p>This is not a movie that is easy to sit through; it is dark, ugly, and violent. An early scene in which Aileen is raped is almost traumatizing at best, it is so lacking in any form of humanity. In another scene, a too-far-gone Aileen comes across an elderly gentleman who is genuinely willing to help the woman, but that isn't something that Aileen is prepared to deal with if it comes from a man. His needless death is an eye-opening turning point to the film, when it really sinks in that this woman is hopelessly lost and can probably never be found.<p>Fair warning: this is a dark, harshly severe movie with no relief until the house lights come up, but if you can disconnect yourself from the onscreen horrors for a few moments, you'll see a story of humanity's worst nightmare: individuals cast aside with no ability to crawl out of the hole into which they've been thrown. There is certainly a message here that needs to be heard, and this movie is one that should be seen. I highly recommend it to those with an open mind, but it is definitely not for the squeamish. It is however one of the best of 2003 and includes NO DOUBT one of the best performances in modern cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>MONSTER is not a happy film. It's one of those movies that leave you dead at the end.<br /><br />If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this film, it's Theron's. For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, beautiful women. Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly. This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing. She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some great acting. Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby is equally remarkable, conveying childlike naivety, seductiveness, stubbornness and growing manipulative ness very well. They both dominate the film. The supporting performances did fine as well. I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern. His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen. While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.<br /><br />The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life. What Aileen did was reprehensible. The violence is not glorified--it's bloody and sick. What's so fascinating (and scary) about this film is that I actually began to sympathize with Wuornos! While I could never condone her actions you can see clearly what led her to it. This is a rare film--it makes a serial killer look sympathetic. What she did was evil, and she had to pay for that. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable. But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.<br /><br />MONSTER is a well-made film that's not for the weak of heart. It's also engaging, engrossing, and realistic. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. You won't learn too much about how Aileen Wournos turned into the person she did. Even the narrative itself is a little confusing at time, so that you can't be sure where Lee and Selby are at given moments. But it's Hollywood professionalism at one of its rare high points. It's made by a professional team for mature adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>Aileen (Charlize Theron) has lived most of her life waiting to be discovered in a similar way to Marilyn Monroe, but this never happened. She ended up blowing guys for five bucks in the back seat of their cars, living out of a storage room, taking baths in the sinks of public restrooms and trying to survive. She has really nothing to cheer her up, until one day she walks into a gay bar and meets Selby (Christina Ricci). They quickly become friends and even more, but not before Aileen recanted some statements she made due to her being a compulsive liar.<br /><br />When things go south with one of her clients, Aileen ends up killing the man after being brutally abused. From that point on we can see her rage towards her clients and her desire to "punish" them for being what they are. Or maybe she is angry with herself for having to do this job and takes it out on them. She does try to change paths though, mainly due to her love for Selby. She wants to take care of her partner's need, but finds no help whatsoever when looking for a job. So, back to the old work...and hello serial killer.<br /><br />There are several things about this movie that make it brilliant, with Theron's performance right at the top of the list. For an actress that is usually involved in representing classy and beautiful women, it must be a real challenge to play the role of Aileen. Part of the credit has to go to the make-up artists though, who made possible an incredible transformation.<br /><br />The other point that I think is worth mentioning is the quality of the script, since the story takes us inside the mind of the serial killer. It is fascinating to understand the motives and reasons behind her actions. I can understand though that people that have been touched by the effects of Wuornos' crimes are not interested in this and may resent it. Also, I am not sure about how much of what is presented is fiction. In my mind, even if part of the "facts" presented are fiction, this movie is a high quality creation and a very interesting option to consider the next time you plan to sit in front of the TV for a couple of hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci star in this graphic and true story about Aileen Wuornos, an abused prostitute who was convicted of killing at least seven men in Florida.<br /><br />Theron stars as Wuornos, while Ricci stars as Selby, a young and extremely naive girl who becomes involved, both romantically and eventually on the run with Aileen.  Aileen met Selby in the midst of her spree, and after spending time with her, she begins to fall in love.  Due to these feelings she's developed, she longs to have a real life and a real relationship with Selby.  However, she can't stop the killing.

After being convicted and sentenced to die, Aileen Wuornos survived for twelve years on Death Row before finally being executed in October of 2002.  Aileen and Selby never spoke to each other after Aileen's trial.<br /><br />This is a very good movie.  Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos won her an Academy Award for best actress.  Christina Ricci's performance of the confused and easily-influenced Selby was excellent as well.  Be warned: the violence and language contained in this movie makes it suitable for mature audiences only.  I highly recommend this film.  Watch and learn about one of history's most notorious serial killers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This controversial film is worth seeing, if only for Charlize Theron's outstanding, Academy Award winning performance.

Aileen Wuornos was finally executed in 2002, after spending many years on death row.<br /><br />The film details the hard knocks life led by Aileen Wuornos, from that of a troubled teenager looking for love in all the wrong places to that of a hard living prostitute. It also looks at the very human side of Aileen Wuornos, a woman who found love in the person of a troubled, young lesbian in her late teens (Christina Ricci), who would ultimately betray the trust that Aileen Wuornos believed lay between her and her eventual fate.<br /><br />Ms. Theron's physical transformation is startling, though I found her still recognizable as Charlize Theron. It is her performance, however, rather than her physical transformation,  that is more startling, as she infuses it with a high voltage intensity and swagger that bowls the viewer over. She makes the person of Aileen Wuornos come to life. She is a low rent individual,  white trash to the core, prostituting herself by getting into cars in order to have sex with total strangers. So, this film is not for the fastidious, as we are looking at the seamy underbelly of the beast in this film, and it sure isn't pretty. It is also a credit to Ms. Theron's compelling performance that the viewer is able to feel pity for Aileen Wuornos, a woman who is so vile, yet, at the same time, so vulnerable and pathetic.<br /><br />The direction is excellent in the film, as are all the supporting performances. Christina Ricci is very good as the weak, passive,  troubled young woman with whom Aileen Wuornos enters into a lesbian love affair, a relationship which lasted years in real life rather than the short time depicted in the film. Ms. Ricci infuses the role with a certain amoral, vapid selfishness that makes the character's betrayal of Aileen Wuornos comprehensible. Bruce Dern, in the role of Thomas,  Aileen Wuornos' only true friend, is a stand out, as he adds depth to an otherwise small role. It is clear that Thomas saw something in Aileen Wuornos that the rest of the world missed. It is the most decent relationship that Aileen Wuornos appears to have had.<br /><br />The film itself, despite the stellar performances, is somewhat flawed,  as it is unclear as to what made Aileen Wuornos tick, though it makes an  attempt at deciphering her psyche. There are several theories that are exposed for the viewer to ponder: abused child, rape victim, and love sick puppet. They fall short of explaining adequately this  troubled woman who would go on to achieve such notoriety. Notwithstanding this unresolved issue, the film is still a compelling one, though not one I would necessarily care to view again, as there is nothing at all uplifting about the disturbing and sordid life led by Aileen Wuornos.

It touched my heart!!!! I love watching this movie over and over again. They did a GREAT job on Charlize Theron make up. She looked just like the real Aileen Wuornos. She acted just like her too. She did a great job on telling Aileen's story. This is a must see movie.<br /><br />I also believer if you enjoy this movie you need to also watch/buy Aileen Wuornos: The selling of a serial Killer. The 1992 interview. I also have this movie and I always watch it before or after watching Monster. The selling of a serial killer is about Aileen's life.... of course. But it is sad hearing about the people in her life wanting to make money off of her. People clamming they love her are trying to talk her into killing her self while she is locked up. It is heart breaking hearing her girlfriend turning her back on Aileen. There is also an interview with her so you can her the truth coming out of her mouth only. Not someone else. These two movies are a must buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Lee (Charlize Theron) was terribly abused as a child and has been a prostitute since the age of 13. Desperate and lonely, she meets a young lesbian named Selby and the two become inseparable.  They need money to start a new life together, so Lee does the only work she knows, only now she uses a gun.<br /><br />This true story of a woman who killed seven men for their money and cars  is extremely brutal and depressing.  Theron is unrecognizable as the hardened killer and gives a heartbreaking and unforgettable performance.  The film doesn't excuse her behavior, it explains it; the result is a movie that is shocking and yet brought tears to my eyes.  This is a woman who had no one to help her, no place to go, and she survived day-to-day by taking what she needed.  Christina Ricci is also very good playing Lee's naive and dependent girlfriend, Selby.<br /><br />This frightening portrait of a lost soul has so much ugliness that I had to fast-forward past a few scenes.  The acting is top-notch, however, and Theron rightly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  A sad and unforgettable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>Only Hollywood magic could transform Charlize Theron into this character, as she portrays a real serial killer.<br /><br />Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci fall in love, and I am so happy.  Then the proverbial s41t hits the fan, and the unhappy hooker (Theron) goes psycho.<br /><br />You thought some of your ex-s and lovers were tough?  The unhappy hooker, a delusional loser, finds a second chance, gains romance, then goes off the deep end.  Christina Ricci is young, naive, and runs away to live happily ever after with her girlfriend.  Stop the movie, and all is well.  Continue the movie, and experience the result of way too much pent up aggression literally exploding.  The hooker struggles desperately to retain her new life, love, and she tries to go straight.<br /><br />Without education, the hooker thinks she can waltz into an office and simply attain a real job.  She has no education, credentials, or manners, so the real world is much tougher than she expected.  Trying to make a nice home for her young lover, she strives to provide.  Sounds like a nice drama or romance to cuddle up to, eh?<br /><br />Suffice to say that the hooker kills the mood.  Poor little (maybe not so naive) Christina Ricci becomes tough, and things progressively get weirder.<br /><br />If you don't dig the psycho drama, tension, or criminal theme, you may enjoy the lesbian romance as it unfolds in unusual ways.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>If you have not seen Charlize Theron 'channel' Aileen Wuornos in the film Monster, you are in for an amazing film experience. This performance by Theron will become legendary, much like Robert DeNero's legendary acting in Raging Bull. Let me explain why I found this film to be exceptional: When I read a book or see a film, I watch for the manner in which the writer,director, and actors portray the characters.  The more justice shown and compassion shown, generally the more I like the work. I am not  convinced of pure evil or pure charity or pure innocenence or pure revenge. Charlize Theron allows us to see the terribly twisted youth and adolescence of Aileen, the series of bad breaks and miscalculations, and yet we also see her crimes as unnecessary, especially all her murders after the first murder. She did kill a sadistic rapist in self defense in her first homocide, but unfortunately this melts into a series of murders. It is when a good Samaratan type of family man picks her up thinking that she is really a person in need of help, and circumstances come together so that Aileen chooses to kill him also, that we see her final sentence is just and we can leave the end of the film with a sense of closure.<br /><br />Christina Ricci plays the lost lesbian girl that was Eileen's partner in these final months and during the murder spree. She does a good job of playing the rebellious teenager, rebelling against any boundaries and yet dependent on the adult world for her meals and clothing and shelter.<br /><br />The film will make you sad and maybe even angry. I become angry when I think about the physical and sexual mistreatment of children and how these experiences may destroy a life course or life path. I felt real compassion for Aileen but also for her victims. Well made, well acted, excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>At the Last Resort Bar & Grill, they have a sign: Home of Cold Beer and Killer Women.  Such gross exploitation of the terrible deeds of Aileen Wuornos makes one queasy in the stomach.  Arrested in 1991 and executed in 2002, Aileen Wuornos was not the first female serial killer in the world, or the first woman executed for murder in the U.S., but she was the U.S.'s first female serial killer.  A highway prostitute who killed only men, she was a scary looking woman whose simmering rage was visible in photos of her staring dark brown eyes.<br /><br />Monster was written and directed by Patty Jenkins, who says in the DVD featurette that she was just "showing what she sees," and would let people make up their own minds.  But unlike an objective journalist armed only with the facts, Jenkins writes a fictionalized script with made-up characters and events.  Although Aileen killed around seven men, we see only four killings in the film.  In the film, people treat her with horrible cruelty, for example a job counselor who says she can only get factory work, but there is none, and a lawyer at a firm where Aileen goes seeking work as a secretary.  It seems unrealistic that everyone would have been so vicious to a woman seeking a job.  That said, Monster is still worth a viewing or two.<br /><br />Charlize Theron worked hard to play the killer Wuornos.  Her performance is like watching the real thing.  Every muscle in her face, every minute expression, conveys more than words ever could (which is good, considering the weakness of the script).  In the film, the Monster has a lot of humanity.  It has just gone unrecognized, which is incredibly tragic and moving.  Christina Ricci plays her girlfriend, Selby.  Bruce Dern plays a Vietnam vet who is Aileen's only friend.  He gives a great performance. I love me some Bruce Dern!<br /><br />The score by BT is perfect- but never played!  Most of the movie plays with no music!  And when there is music, it is barely audible over the speaking.  Memorable shots and lines I can count on one hand.  The most striking photography shows Wuornos resting under an overpass, as cars pass by.  I would have used these shots a lot more.  Monster is really more like a made for TV/Lifetime movie than a large film production.<br /><br />Monster ends strongly.  The last phone call between Wuornos and her girlfriend was very well done and had the most emotional impact of any scene in the film. At the end of the movie, I cried despite saying I would never cry for this murderer.  But I cried for this wasted life, this abandoned soul, and for other abandoned souls out there, looking for survival and for love.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Monster" is just one of those films where you want to pull for the villain(or perhaps, victim?) but you know that deep inside she is wrong.  "Monster" tells with vivid detail the story of Aileen Wuornos(Theron), a prostitute who has basically been held down her entire life.  Abused sexually, physically and emotionally by her family, Wuornos grows up on the streets as a prostitute.  Eventually she finds true love in the arms of Selby(Ricci), a young outcast who she runs away with.<br /><br />While trying to become honest, Wuornos runs into wall after wall for the simple fact that all she has ever known is prostitution and hate.  She is turned down for jobs due to the lack of experience.  She's even turned away by the unemployment office.  In short, she is kicked hard while she's down.  Returning to hooking, she has a violent experience that ends with the death of a "John."  Perhaps he deserved it, that's what you'll probably think when you see the film, but this is only the beginning of a violent string of murders that Wuornos will commit.  Though she does show mercy to one man in the film, she eventually becomes nothing but another cold-blooded murderer who is tailed by the cops.  She runs again, along with Selby, and the rest is history.<br /><br />This is a very disturbing film.  It is openly honest and, as stated before, you will long to cheer for Wuornos, but in the end, she is ultimately a lost soul with no real light at the end of her tunnel.<br /><br />Theron shines as Wuornos, almost unrecognizable under make-up and her own physical alterations.  Ricci does a good job as well, making me want to hate her for the selfish things she does to Wuornos.  The rest of the cast does well, but the focus here is placed obviously on Theron.<br /><br />Check this one out, it is definitely a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>If there was ever a more deserved academy award for a lead dramatic performance, Charlize Theron as serial killer, Aileen Wuormos, it most certainly is this one. Take away the latex, make-up and false teeth, the extra thirty pounds and damaged blond hair, and you would still have the unnerving personification of this tragic woman.<br /><br />This dark tale, based on a true story, is disturbing on many levels. The character of Aileen Wuormos, on one level, is a terrible indictment of a compassionless society. A more accurate title for this film would be, "The Making of a Serial Killer." Aileen Wuormas was sexually abused as a young child by one of her father's best friends, and then beaten severely by her father for telling him. In effect, this little child was raped on a continual basis throughout puberty. Forced on the street at thirteen years of age, she turns to prostitution, and lives her life in this manner for the rest of her days. As the character states at one point in the film, no one knows what life is like as a homeless person and a prostitute, unless you are one, it is not an easy life, taking a tremendous amount of will to survive, but if it's the only thing you know to survive, you keep doing it.<br /><br />In a seeming compassionless world, she meets a lonely young woman who reaches out to her. Selby (Christina Ricci) is a lovely enough girl, naive and inexperienced, but is weak, incapable of action, and utterly dependent. Though for the strong and independent Aileen, a perfect partner to care for and love. This is a complicated relationship, but in the end, a transparent one.<br /><br />The turning point in the film, and for Aileen Wuormos, is the unmentionable incident, where she's beaten, made a prisoner, and horrifically raped. To save her life she retaliates as any person in the same situation would, killing her assailant. This sets her off onto a killing spree across Florida, assassinating Johns, found in compromising positions. When she finally confesses to Selby about the murders, her justification is,<br /><br />"Everybody out there is killing and raping, and I'm the one out there killing them".<br /><br />There is no justifying murder in any situation, unless in self defence, or in the organised arena of war, but writer/director, Patty Jenkins, has endeavoured to reveal to us another side, and that is a victim living on raw hopes and dreams that are continually crushed, unleashing a response, an almost primeval reaction of extreme violence.<br /><br />This is a film that I would have no desire to see again, though brilliant, once is enough, as it is such a tragedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>As you can tell by the 300 other reviews here, this version of the Aileen Wournos story doesn't tell the whole truth. If that's what you're looking for you need to view one of the many biographs on the serial killer.<br /><br />If you want to see Charlize Theron's monster performance (and makeup) of this real life "Monster", this movie will do the job for you. With the help of some magnificent makeup artistry, pretty girl Theron transformed herself into a trailer trash hooker for this flick. She was well abetted by an equally strong performance by another pretty girl, Christina Ricci, who plays her best bud and lover.<br /><br />If I was a state of Florida official I wouldn't be too happy with the way the Sunshine State is portrayed in this movie. It sure doesn't look like the place everyone east of the Mississippi River aspires to retire to!<br /><br />But the main reason to rent or buy this is to see Theron's once in a lifetime performance. She probably equals the transformation Cliff Robertson made playing a mentally retarded man in the 1968 film "Charly", another tour de force that won an Oscar. People that think great actors are made and not born might want to think again after viewing this movie for Theron sure is a different animal that the one she played in previous movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>Before I saw this movie I saw the HBO special on Aileen Wurnos and then I saw this one....and to be perfectly honest...I couldnt tell the difference between Aileen and Charlize.  I mean Charlize was that good....she WAS Aileen.<br /><br />  Of course this movie chronicles infamous serial killer Aileen Wurnos' trail of mayhem.....tremendous performances throughout and of course the topper was Theron.  A well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress...she obviously did her homework on Aileen and it shows big time.  She deserves it.<br /><br />  So take a look at it....Therons performance is astonishing.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>There should have been more extras on this DVD, but it is a handy way to preserve Charlize Theron's performance in a difficult part, the performance that netted her this year's Academy Award for Best Performance by a Lead Actress.  Some of the extras show her in different stages of makeup, and also researching with the director the very places the real life Aileen Wuornos used to frequent, down in Florida on the ugly side.  I thought Scott Wilson also deserved a nomination, he had also a very resonant part as the last man Aileen managed to kill, the one who tried to help her, who was a family man, thus showing that Aileen had become addicted to murder and that her excuses for murdering these men ("they tried to molest me") had grown paper thin with repetition, even though the first one really did try to murder her and raped her in an ugly way, and yet when the audience watches Scott Wilson die for apparently no reason at all, we're brought back to our memories of him as a handsome young man playing one of the heartless killers in Richard Brooks' IN COLD BLOOD, and we feel that Movie Karma has played a part in deciding his fate.<br /><br />Christina Ricci was pretty good too, though I wonder what the real-life person she's playing had to say about Ricci's portrayal of her as a user, a whiner, a sloth, a slut, and one who would sell out the only person who ever cared for her in the world.<br /><br />Now that the movie OPEN WATER has come out, with its leading actress Blanchard Ryan who is an exact duplicate of the "pretty" Charlize Theron, will we ever see that one again or will we always be seeing the grim one with the Lon Chaney makeup?  That would be a loss because Theron was so alluring in THREE DAYS IN THE VALLEY and THE ITALIAN JOB etc.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>I was actually hesitant to see this, simply because, while I had followed the case of Wuornos, I had never been a full out Charlize Theron fan, judging her work based on 'Sweet November' and 'Devil's Advocate,' essentially I perceived her as attractive set dressing.<br /><br />Man, did Monster ever make me eat my words!  Theron delivers a true, jaw-droppingly good, transformative performance.  Having seen many documentaries on Wuornos, I was familliar with her, and Theron absolutely channels this woman.  Her physical transformation alone is brilliant, but the way she adds a depth of humanity and pathos to a very unsympathetic person is astounding.  It's not just a question of good 'mimickry,' but you actually do learn about how Aileen viewed the world, and can see it from her point of view, based solely on Theron's heartbreaking performance.  It truly is well worth purchasing this DVD, because work this good is rare.<br /><br />The story, however, leaves alot to be desired.  While not a bad retelling, certain facts are smudged, and the character Selby never existed, and is not as fully developed.  But the flaws are minor in light of Theron's no-jolds-barred attempt to humanize a serial killer who seemingly had no soul.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Patty Jenkins<p>Roger Ebert listed "Monster" as the best film of all of 2003.  Charlize Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  For months before the Oscars the talk had been about how amazing Theron's performance was and how not only was it the best performance of the year, it was one of the best performances in years.  This is a lot of high praise that raised my expectations on exactly what it was that I was going to see in "Monster".<p>"Monster" is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos.  Aileen lived as a prostitute in Florida and became a serial murderer, killing her prospective clients.  As the film opens, Aileen is sitting under an overpass and is reflecting back on past events, specifically her meeting of Selby (Christina Ricci).  After meeting Selby in a bar, Selby quickly becomes Aileen's best (and only) friend and also her lover.  They are both very lonely and needy people.  For the love of Selby, Aileen wants to clean up her life, quit hooking, and find a real job so she can support Selby.  Unfortunately for Aileen, she is unable to find a job because she has no work experience, no resume, and a huge chip on her shoulder that prevents anyone in a position to help to even want to help her.  Selby is demanding, telling Aileen that she needs to start hooking again because they don't have any money, she is hungry, and this is one thing that Aileen can do to support her.  <p>When she is raped by one of her clients, Aileen finally snaps and kills him.  She tells Selby that this was a one time thing, but after this first murder she starts killing and robbing her other clients.  It is at this point where we start to see Aileen crack under the pressure of what her life has become.  She feels that from day one she never stood a chance.  She was sexually abused as a child and by age 13 was pregnant and a prostitute.  This is her life and she has no opportunity to improve her life.  Her experience trying to find a legitimate job is proof of this.  "Monster" is the story of Aileen Wuornos and it is brutal and unflinching.  <p>It is impossible to separate the performance of Charlize Theron from the rest of the movie.  "Monster" is built on the raw power and pain of Theron's transformation into Aileen Wuornos.  This transformation was both physical and emotional.  Charlize Theron is a strikingly beautiful woman and early in her career the roles she became known for were little more than the beautiful wife/girlfriend/woman (Legend of Bagger Vance, The Devil's Advocate, The Cider House Rules).  "Monster" required a physical change in the appearance of Theron's face and the make-up helped change the beautiful Theron into the ugly Wuornos.  The other part of the transformation is that Wuornos was a tormented, pained, and angry woman and this required Theron to not simply be a woman acting but rather to "become" Aileen Wuornos.  She succeeds.  <p>During the first half of the movie I could not figure out why Theron had won the Academy Award for Best Actress.  She had become Aileen, but the performance was nothing terribly impressive for the first fifty minutes.  But when Selby confronts Aileen to return to being a prostitute, that scene nailed it for me and brought Theron's performance to an entirely new level.  The raw emotion Theron conveyed carried the movie.  The performance became more emotional, angry, vulnerable, fearful, and edgy and at no point did I think that this was Theron acting.  I saw Aileen Wuornos.  <p>The movie itself, without Charlize Theron, did not feel to me that it was telling a story that could not have been told on a made for cable (because of the content) movie.  But the movie is not so much about the plot and about the story, but rather about the performance and transformation of Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  The performance makes the viewer capable of feeling pity for Aileen without excusing her actions.  I don't feel that there is any question that Theron deserved the Oscar for "Monster".  <p>-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...aesthetically, this film was simply brilliant.  <p>However, it was hard to watch Charlize Theron's character careen downhill for most of the last 2/3rds of the movie.  The parts where she tries to go straight and does job interviews are especially painful---I kept looking away from the TV screen because it was so painful to watch---really a testament to her phenomenal acting skills.  <p>There is a raw emotional/spiritual violence going on here and perfectly captured on screen that is far far worse than anything I saw in "Saving Private Ryan" or "Schindler's List"---it is the absolute horror and heartbreak of watching the total and relentless destruction of a human being despite all of her indomitable vitality and will.  This is what I imagine it'd be like to watch somebody being buried alive, you end up wishing for a mercy killing, that someone would at least be kind of enough to shoot her first.<p>It's safe to say that Charlize Theron earned her Oscar every bit of the way.  <p>Christina Ricci also puts in a very strong performance as Lee's lesbian girlfriend...I don't know what their real-life sexual orientation is, but the scenes where the two women first make out outside of a roller rink are as dizzyingly passionate as any I've ever seen on film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Oscar smiled on Charlize Theron.  And boy did she deserve it.  Her performance (aside from the much ballyhooed physical transformation) is the stuff legends are made of.  There isn't a moment that Theron isn't Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who murdered at least seven of her johns.  Charlize takes each movement, each emotion, each glance and makes Aileen a character you DO feel sorry for.<br />And for me, that's the problem with MONSTER.  Aileen certainly had a difficult upbringing, a youth full of abuse, of not being pretty, of not being loved.  But, ultimately, does that justify the lives she took?  Granted, her first kill could be considered as self-defense. But later she planned her murders, she solicited these johns knowing she would murder them, and doing it just so she could keep her little kewpie doll lover, Selby.  Director/writer Patty Jensen obviously stacked the deck in favor of Aileen, trying to manipulate her audience into accepting Aileen as the victim of her background, of men who used women, etc.  But what about the last victim she killed?  He wasn't even interested in her for sex, but she killed him anyway.  This is a heartless, self-centered, and certainly disturbed woman who demonstrated little remorse in the end.  MONSTER is a manipulative film, and one that tries to make light of Aileen's crimes.  It also portrays her lover as a selfish, self-centered young girl who couldn't face up to the fact that not only did she know what Aileen was doing, but encouraged her to continue doing it, just so she could get her house by the beach.  Serial killers are not role models, and although one can sympathize to a point, this movie whitewashes the facts with its unabashed bias for Aileen.<br />But, as a movie, one can't fault the performances.  Not only is Theron brilliant, but Christina Ricci does a fine job as Selby, even though her character ends up being as despicable as Aileen.<br />And while we're at it, why should we feel sorry for Aileen when she goes for a job interview at a law office without a resume?  Is this really true to life?  You don't get interviews for legal secretaries without a resume, and just because Aileen WANTED the job, why should she get it when she's not qualified?  This manipulation of facts by director Jensen is typical of the stacked deck of a movie.<br />Worth seeing for Charlize Theron's undeniably jawdropping performance, but don't make the mistake of buying the awkward sentimentality it is trying to gag you with.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>&quot;Monster&quot; is one of the most talked about films of 2003, not just because of Charlize Theron's groundbreaking performance.

Her facial expressions, her physical mannerisms, her vocal style, and her presence resemble the real-life Wuournos.  Therefore, she clearly researched her role thoroughly.  Theron never loses that presence for a moment.<p>Christina Ricci's underrated performance as Wuournos's girlfriend Selby is wonderful.

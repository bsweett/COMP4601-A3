The kids said things like, "When I grow up, I wanna file all day...I wanna claw my way up to middle-management...I wanna be a Yes-Man."  "Office Space" tells the story of a group of workers who hold such jobs.<br /><br />Peter, the film's lead character, suffers with the realization that his work has no meaning.  To his company, the workers are simply cogs in the machine, interchangeable and unnecessary.  Their salaries and benefits convince them that they cannot live without their jobs, so they pretend to love their work, constantly justifying and rationalizing employment that numbs the spirit.<br /><br />Peter describes his life as a never-ending string of days that continue to trump the previous with degrees of misery and angst.  He comes to work late, avoids his boss and tries to do as little work as possible, taking pride in the hours each week he spends "spacing out" in front of his computer.  He works with equally miserable employees who spend their days dreaming about destroying the copying machine and longing for the former model of stapler that the company once used.<br /><br />After a Jerry Maguire-esque epiphany, Peter decides office cubicle life is not for him and the action of the film is set in place.  His rebellion against his place of employment creates an ironic twist, as his forthright disdain for the procedures and protocols of the company earns him a reputation for honesty and outside-the-box thinking.<br /><br />A subplot grows from Peter's infatuation with a local waitress who finds herself in an equally unrewarding job.  Her boss paradoxically pressures her to seek individuality that conforms to other employees.  She has no problem finding common ground with cubicle slaves who spend their days doing just enough to keep from getting fired.<br /><br />Politically, the film lashes out against jobs that force workers to constantly repeat tasks and procedures until they can do their jobs without thought.  The duties drain workers of creativity and uniqueness, building a graveyard of zombie-like beings who spout out acronyms and lingo in robot-like monotones.  Those familiar with this type of work environment will find the film to be painfully funny.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.  I think anyone who has ever worked in an office will identify with all of the characters.  There are days when I feel that the lead character played by Ron Livingston was based on my life.  I must be &quot;having a case of the Mondays&quot;  I used to work with a guy who insisted on only using his personal antique stapler. If anyone ever finds a hypnotist that can zap me into not knowing I went to work - please find me. Until then, I will continue to arrive late to work, enter through the back door, zone out for an hour pretending to work, and get an actual fifteen minutes of work done every day.  This movie gets funnier every time. Everyone who commutes to work, especially in California, will also identify with the traffic scenes. After seein the movie, I can now at least smile a little thinking about how funny everyday, mundane life can really be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>If you ever felt like your cubicle walls resembled a coffin, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is an office worker who feels trapped in a soulless job performing endless mind-numbing tasks.  This 30-something worker is panicking that he could still be working this job when he's  50.<br />When he turns to his fellow co-workers for validation, they give him the standard response that he should be happy to have that kind of security.<br /><br />At the urging of his girlfriend, Peter sees a hypnotist to relax.  During the hypnotherapy session, however, the hypnotist dies before he can wake Peter up.  So then, a hypnotized and overly relaxed Peter goes to work and starts telling everyone how he really feels about his job...and TBS reports.<br />The things he says and does while under hypnosis are hilarious.  I especially like the line, "It's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care."<br /><br />As a cubicle dweller myself, I could relate to many moments in this film like having to report to numerous supervisors, supervisors who fuss over the smallest detail, supervisors who don't listen and talk over you, Hawaiian Fridays to boost morale (especially funny since it's announced right after introducing the man who could fire any of them), as well as the scene where Peter and his co-workers beat the crap out of a printer.  Who hasn't wanted to do that?<br /><br />I found myself relating a little too well to Peter's situation...so much so that if I didn't laugh, I'd probably cry.<br /><br />Peter isn't the only funny character in this movie either.  I also liked Peter's co-worker Michael Bolton ("Why should I change my name? He's the one who sucks"), Peter's co-worker who makes the "Oh" face, Peter's neighbor who says he'd have two women at once if he were a millionaire, Peter's girlfriend who's forced to wear buttons of flair and deal with a boss who wants her to read his mind, and of course, Lundberg who ever so casually asks Peter if he can work Saturday aaaaand Sunday.  Thaaaanks.<br /><br />Overall, a hilarious movie if you've ever felt like the only human working in zombieland.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Office Space is one of those rare movies that aren't a big hit, but established itself as an instant cult classic simply by being `almost' a documentary.  I won't give away anything that you can't read in the Amazon Editorial, but the characters are so `clinically clich&eacute;' in a hilarious way.  You will recognize a person from your office in every scene and if you aren't seething with hate, you'll definitely be laughing hysterically.  The guys who scheme the money laundering are truly clever and the boss is truly an inspired piece of irritating nonsense.  Only the girlfriend lacks any comedic fashion other than the workplace she inhabits - a `Chili's' style restaurant nightmarishly funny in itself.  There are some fairly clever sight gags throughout the movie that just keep your interest on a constant level.  I won't say it's a fantastic film, but I sure as heck wasn't bored and found a lot of true, funny events to ponder.  If this film is worth anything at all, it's the character, "Milton", an overweight, coke-bottled glass wearing, wimpy do-nothing that cannot find his stapler.  He turns out to be the unlikeliest of heroes.<br /><br />The DVD extras are especially inspired pieces of humor and not at all wasteful like most.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Mike Judge, creator of the Milton comic strips and the TV series<br /><br />King of the Hill (and Beavis & Butthead) has never been a favorite of mine. But I've heard many good things about Office Space and I see why. This was a terrific, funny, and entertaining movie. The film is very funny (a lot of it is subtle humor and it's charming). Ron Livingston plays Peter, a typical working man who works at Initech but hates his job which he views as merely sitting in a cubicle. He works along with two very funny co-workers;<br /><br />Michael Bolton (David Herman), no relation to the pop star and Samir (Ajay Naidu). After a strange experience with a hypnotist Peter decides he's just not going to go to work and stay at home. Then he gets a sexy girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and gets promoted. The film also includes the character that inspired the movie Milton (Stephen Root, Dodgeball) who is a mumbling idiot who was laid off from Initech months ago but continues to recieve a paycheck due to a glitch in the system...As I said it's subtle humor. One part that I found hilarious was when Michael is sitting in his car rapping along to this hardcore gangster rap, really getting into it and when a black man walks past his car he locks the door.

Arguably the best work-related comedy ever written, Office Space follows the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a computer programmer in his late-20's who hates his mind-numbing job at Initech Corporation where he updates bank software for the year 2000 switch.<br /><br />Peter is joined by fellow computer programmers Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). All four men are plagued by the condescending, soul-killing management techniques of their boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) who begins every utterance with a protracted "Yeah..." Completely unhappy with his job and his romantic relationship, Peter whines about his life with his co-workers while drinking coffee at local restaurant, Chotchkie's, where he's infatuated with a beautiful waitress, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who is forced by her boss to wear "pieces of flair". Samir and Michael encourage Peter to ask her out, but Peter is too paralyzed by life to do anything about it.<br /><br />All that changes, however, when Peter visits a hypnotherapist with his girlfriend. In the act of sending Peter into a state of total relaxation, the hypnotherapist suffers a heart attack. His untimely death leaves Peter in a perpetual state of relaxation, providing his life with a much needed injection of enjoyment. The next morning, Peter sleeps through work, dumps his girlfriend, then goes and asks Joanna out to lunch. Peter and Joanna hit it off, and he reveals to her that he's simply going to stop going to work.<br /><br />After a good week or so of neglecting his job, two independent consultants - Bob Slydell (John McGinley) and Bob Porter (Paul Willson) - reveal to Peter that he's being promoted to the upper ranks of management. Meanwhile, his studious co-workers Samir and Michael are slated to be canned. Armed with this insider information, Peter approaches Michael about concocting a previously mentioned computer program to take the remainders of every bank transaction at Initech and funnel them into a private account owed by Peter, Samir, and Michael. Michael is reluctant until he finds out that he's going to be fired.<br /><br />As the two set out to convince Samir that their plan will work, resident office weirdo Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) is in the process of having his paycheck stopped by the consultants who uncover the fact that Milton was fired several years earlier but is still being paid. When Bill Lumbergh moves Milton's desk into the basement, he whispers that he will set the place on fire.<br /><br />Meanwhile, long-time corporate cog Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle) experiences the dream of a lifetime when he's badly injured by a drunk driver. Fresh off a seven-figure settlement, and in possession of his prototype "jump to conclusions mat," Tom tells Peter to hang in there, that life has a lot of good things in store for those who wait. While attending a party for Tom, Samir and Michael grow nervous when Tom's lawyer reveals that white collar criminals go to federal "pound-me-in-the-ass" prison where they better "beat someone up or become someone's bitch" on the first day.<br /><br />Office Space is one laugh after another, and the heroes' nefarious plan works surprisingly well until it hits a glitch. When the scheme devised by Peter, Michael, and Samir goes up in smoke, Milton decides to create some smoke of his own...<br /><br />The brainchild of King of the Hill and Beavis & Butthead creator Mike Judge, Office Space will leave you in absolute stitches. Funny from beginning to end, with a plot mysteriously similar to Superman 3, this is one movie that anyone who's ever worked a job from hell (and haven't we all?) needs to see at least once. But if you've ever spent a day trapped in the confines of an office cubicle, you need to see this movie at least twelve times...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>"Office Space" isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it's certainly one of my favorites. Like zillions of other people, I was introduced to this movie while trapped in a miserable soul-sucking job in a dysfunctional office environment. The kind of job where I'd spend Sundays curled up on the couch in a fetal position dreading Monday ... the kind of job where I'd dread Friday nights because I knew they weren't going to last long.<br /><br />I wore out my VHS copy of this film years ago, so the DVD special edition got snapped up in a hurry. Some of the deleted scenes are hilarious, although the best new footage -- John C. McGinley's extended riffs on the wonder that is Michael Bolton -- is only to be found in the Mike Judge-hosted retrospective making-of feature.<br /><br />In your darkest moments, "Office Space" is that shining jewel that makes life bearable again. It is indeed chicken soup for the cubicled soul. It's all "about" the workplace in America in the 1990s -- the cubicle-bound middle-management culture is so brilliantly dissected. From the traffic jam in the opening scene to the soulless birthday party held for the "division VP" towards the end, to the blinding white rage of the gangsta rap soundtrack, it is so funny that you will hurt.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding, of course. It was shocking to find out that long-time "Cheers" barstool occupant Paul Willson was cast at the last minute; he's exactly the kind of actor you'd expect to find on the fringes of a movie like this one, so you wonder why it took so long to find him. Everyone has their personal favorites among the supporting players (McGinley & Willson, Ajay Naidu and Gary Cole all rob blind every scene they're in) but David Herman, playing "Michael Bolton", is my personal favorite. Maybe it's the short-sleeve-shirt with tie ensemble, or the printer scene, or, at long last, "Call me Mike", but there are times when I've watched "Office Space" just to identify with him and his plight.<br /><br />In the end, "Office Space" went from just funny to truly life-changing the moment Peter Gibbsons said that he dreamed of doing "nothing". That's it! That's the moment! That's what we all really want, deep down, after years of crushing middle-management rules, memos, and coffee cups held chest-high. Yeah. Great. Why don't you just go ahead and do that?</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I can think about several different scenes from this movie and just start laughing. It's one of those movies. Mike Judge(King Of The Hill), wrote and directed this hilarious look at the mundane life of office workers. Peter(Ron Livingston) has a boring life. He lives in a plain, by the numbers apartment with an odd neighbor(Diedrich Bader from "The Drew Carey Show"), and works in front of a computer all day in a small cubicle. It's the same rut day in and day out. He has a smarmy boss with an very slow, annoying way of speech named Bill Lumberg(Played by the awesome Gary Cole). This guy is pricelessly funny. Many points go to Mr. Cole. He also, in a very funny joke, has a friend that works there named Michael Bolton. Don't think there's not many jokes there!. The company then begins to downsize and Peter's two best friends are on that list, while he is to be promoted. The three guys then set out for revenge and devise a plan to launder funds from company accounts. All seems to be golden, when something goes horribly wrong and the guys scramble to find a solution to save their butts!. Jennifer Aniston also co-stars(and looking cute as ever) as Peter's waitress girlfriend. Stephen Root from "NewsRadio" co-stars as Milton, a highly geeky loser who never gets the attention or respect at work. Like Cole, his comedic performance is incredibly funny. The ending kinda just happens real quickly, and one wishes it was a bit longer and more fleshed out. We've come this far!. The movie has many laugh out loud moments that are both hysterical and oh so true!. Who doesn't hate their job, right?. The film hits the bullseye on that front. It's a shame this intelligent film didn't get the recognition it deserved. It is definitley finding a voice on cable and video. Good. If your looking for a fun little movie that you may of missed, this is the movie for you!. As Bill Lumberg himself might say, ' I want you to see this movie, m'kaaaayyy?. Riiiggghhhttt. Teriffic'. Well said Bill.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Some people are completely fulfilled in their job-related pursuits, are supported by their co-workers, and put all their heart into their work.  Then, there are those for whom the exact opposite to all three of those statements.  "Office Space" is for that latter group.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Office Space" focuses primarily on Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a beaten-down cubicle drone who is just going through his life/job on autopilot.  When a visit to a hypnotherapist goes horribly wrong, however, Peter snaps out of his funk & starts doing things on his own terms...with predictable hilarious results!<br /><br />Where this movie really succeeds is that it perfectly captures the essence of an un-fulfilling work environment.  Most anyone who has ever held a job can relate, but those (like myself) who have lived a "job from hell" scenario will cringe all the more and laugh all the heartier.<br /><br />The auxiliary cast is also spectacular.  Gary Cole as boss "Bill Lumbergh" has now become a classic performance, while such actors as Stephen Root ("Milton), Jennifer Aniston ("Joanna"), David Herman ("Michael Bolton"), & Ajay Naidu ("Samir") turn in spot-on comedic gems.<br /><br />I consider this to be one of my favorite films of all-time for its ability to capture (through humor and satire, of course) the dysfunctional work environment.  If you haven't "lived it", then perhaps this type of humor will not appeal to you.  For the desk-jockeys, sales-clerks, and pencil-pushers of the world, however, be prepared to laugh long and hard!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>OFFICE SPACE is a film from 1999 believe it or not but it is from the comedy legend Mike Judge.  Written and directed by Judge with wit, realism and spot on observations this film about the everyday work place truly stands the test of time.  It inded deserves the cult following it has acquired and reigns in a class all its own as it satirizes the American worker so perfectly.  The story has a purpose but also provides laughs from beginning to end that often turn into side splitting belly laughs.  The entire cast is excellent with Ron Livingston, Stephen Root and Gary Cole in particular reigning supreme.  Livingston shines and makes the whole story line seem very plausible and helps the viewer care for all the characters.  And it is so much fun to see an early Jennifer Anniston and you will never forget her dealing with her flair after this film.<br /><br />Blu ray is indeed a magic worker and this film looks excellent on blu ray.  The video is crisp, clear, bright with colors that pop and realistic flesh tones.  Black/white ratio is superb and it is the added clarity that tuly brings this film to a new dimension.  The audio is also excellent.  This is a dialogue driven film and it is always crisp and clear.  When music is present it comes out of the surround speakers pefectly never overshadowing the dialogue.  The entire film comes to new life on blu ray.  If you love this film and own the dvd double dipping for the blu ray is a must.  The viewing experience is truly superior to the dvd.  And if you are an OFFICE SPACE virgin the excellent blu ray at this great price makes it a no brainer.  Its story and humor truly stand the test of time.  Highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>My favorite character is Dietrich Bader, the next door neighbor.  This is a perfect movie, a classic rewatchable good time along the lines of The Ref and Princess Bride and Goonies.  This is the movie that I recommend without qualification to foreign students of English.  This is also the best role of Jennifer Aniston's career.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Office Space was made in 1999, and still relevant in today's job market.  The sharp plot revolves around Ron Livingston as Peter Gibbons.  His waking life is spent on a mind-numbing job in an office cubicle, reporting to eight bosses.  He has two geeky friends that hope to raise in ranks at Initech, the company they all work for.  Initech wants to downsize and increase profits by sending some jobs overseas, and eliminate others.<br /><br />Peter has a girlfriend that insists he go to therapy before they marry.  He agrees and is hypnotized at a group therapy session.  The overweight therapist that hypnotized Peter collapses and dies before he can take Peter out of the relaxing trance that makes him worry free.  He is now open to do what he wants, not what he feels he has to do to fit in his bland reality.  He was supposed to work overtime Saturday and Sunday, but sleeps through 17 messages from his boss and girlfriend.<br /><br />Peter goes back to work on Monday, not caring if he has a job or not.  He decides to just leave, and no longer have to deal with his boss, (Gary Cole).  However, Peter is reminded that his appointment with efficiency experts is now and he should go.  Because he could care less if he has his job; his leisurely new attitude and total honesty about his work habits, the efficiency experts are impressed.  Gibbons laughs that there is nothing to motivate him.  The efficiency experts are impressed and ecstatic that they found a "button" to motivate a talented employee.  He is promoted to supervise four people.  On leaving, Peter sees that the efficiency experts plan to lay off his two close friends.  The friends, along with Peter,  hatch a crazy plot to get back at the company.<br /><br />The movie also follows the pathetic life of the office worker "Milton" and his red "Streamline" stapler.  Milton moves from space to lower class space until his office is in the basement storeroom.  Milton is key to the ending, as well as many laughs.<br /><br />The plot continues to develop, including Gibbons  interest in a waitress (Jennifer Anniston) at the restaurant he takes coffee breaks at.  There is also a scheme between Gibbons and his two friends on how to make money without working.  The movie has some slow spots, but the laughs and parody of the realities of corporate culture make up a stunningly hilarious and relevant film.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>Are you fed up with the mindless bureaucracy of your workplace? nauseated with the importance of process over results? anxiety ridden because of your job? then Office Space is the movie for you.  The setting for Office Space is an Information Technology company that processes transactions for Credit Unions, with a collection of employees that are all either bored, angry, aloof, incompetent, anxious or suffer from one of a hundred other maladies or neurotic manifestations.  No doubt this sort of work environment will be familiar to most.<br /><br />It would be convenient to say that this is just another movie about how the corporate work environment drains us of our humanity, but Office Space offers us much more. The mindless bureaucracy, doing work solely to satisfy some inane process (PTS Reports), the sense of detachment from reality is eerily reminiscent of a Kafka novel.  Lundberg, the boss, who is completely unaware of what his employees do and how they feel, endlessly repeats his mantra of ok, ok , while his employees become more and more stressed and unfulfilled.<br /><br />Peter, the lead character, undergoes a profound Peter Pan like psychological transformation after which he is no longer motivated to do his job.  He comes and goes as he pleases and begins to openly express his true feelings about the job and the environment.  His new relaxed attitude impresses the clueless consultants, with their prepackaged prescription for transforming the organization (i.e. reducing headcount), who have been brought in to fine tune the organization.<br /><br />Naturally, no story of this genre would be complete without a love connection between the main character and yet another troubled, trapped soul.  Peter's love interest comes by way of a waitress at a nearby restaurant who fights conformity by wearing only the minimum pieces of flair on her uniform.  She endures the endless questioning from her manager about why she wears only the minimum pieces of flair, when she is so clearly and simply trying to preserve some part of her humanity.<br /><br />The dam of self-control that held the employees in check finally begins to crack when Peter and two of his co-workers hatch a plot of revenge against the company.  Of course their plot like everything else goes badly wrong, but in the end it seems that justice is served.<br /><br />You will laugh out loud, you may cry at times, but if this dark comedy does not send your mind and heart in search of your humanity, sadly you have missed the point.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If they ever decided to make a live-action "Dilbert" movie, it might resemble "Office Space."<br /><br />There's a lot of the same bitter surreality infused in this hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of "Beavis & Butthead" fame), all about three rebellious office employees who have finally had enough. Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job. Which is just about everybody.<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell a waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her.<br /><br />Because layoffs are impending, Peter accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session, and is instructed to relax. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under his hypnotic influence. And nobody snaps him out of it. The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy.<br /><br />He conspires with fiery Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and the ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with a secret computer virus. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control when the virus goes glitchy haywire -- and their scheme is threatened with exposure.<br /><br />"Office Space" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that "you took my stapler." This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech -- sort of like a crazier version of "The Office."<br /><br />And Judge knows how to wring all the bitter comedy from this scenario. He creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film ("Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh..."). There's a less interesting subplot about Peter's unstable relationship with the equally POed-about-her-job waitress, but the real draw here is all the corporate cheating and craziness.<br /><br />This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field, and Peter receiving a raise because he no longer cares if he gets fired. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane ("Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day...") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap. You can see who it is way in advance, but it's no less hilarious when it happens -- with disastrous consequences.<br /><br />The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective about what is important in life is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his simmering rage at his rotten job, or his deep hatred for the copier. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT sappy singer. As for Cole, he's utterly brilliant as a boss who is as endearing and appealing as a rake on a chalkboard.<br /><br />"Office Space" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. When you aren't laughing your butt off, you'll be cheering on the disgruntled salami-slicers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>'Office Space' bombed at the box office in February 1999, pulling in only $10,827,810 domestically according to Box Office Mojo.  It limped into what appeared to be oblivion after six scant weeks.  Except for one small thing...<br /><br />...in DVD/home video-land, 'Office Space' became a cultural phenomenon.  As one reviewer notes, Mike Judge's workplace masterpiece "promptly broke every video record in Fox history."  And eight years after its release it continues to be a phenomenon.  In retrospect, the big screen release was terribly mis-marketed.  Count me among the many who bypassed it in the theater because I couldn't make heads or tails out of the ads.<br /><br />Judge's film is set in a 'nameless Texas city," but this is clearly Dallas.  For those of us that have lived in that city - the corporate home of TGI Friday's and its flair-bedazzled employees - there are inside laughs by the bucketful, including the back-to-back apartments with paper-thin walls, the massive traffic pile-ups on 635 (LBJ), Initech's classic Dallas office space, etc.<br /><br />Great performances here:  Mike Judge's (uncredited) cameo as Jennifer Aniston's flair-obsessed manager; David Herman's fantastic turn as Michael Bolton (no relation); and John C. McGinley's excellent portrayal as a workforce consultant (he delivers the movie's most memorable line: "This straight shooter has upper management written all over him.")</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I only worked in one office for a month and I can relate to a lot of things in this movie: the printer that barely worked at times, the overdemanding boss, the rules and regulations and that feeling that any kind of profit and you're not going to see a dime from it. Unlike certain comedy movies which are based primarily on being disgusting, rude or people getting smacked by things, Office Space gets its laughs by moments where you go "I know someone exactly like that".<br /><br />Peter and 2 friends work at Initech, a computer company that prides itself on making workers do what they've been told to do. After a hypnotherapy session, Peter becomes carefree and uninhibited but he gets a promotion. How to get back at them? Put a virus in the computer system that takes the remainders of transactions and puts them in a separate account. Will they get caught?<br /><br />One of the great things about this movie is that it seems to take itself seriously while having fun at the same time. While there's no big comedy punchlines, the film is quite funny at certain personas we've met such as that slooow tallllking guy...mmkay? Or bosses in restaurants making demands while saying it's up to you if you want to do it but I'm gonna whine if you don't.<br /><br />Acting-wise the film's straight across the board. While I only know 3 cast members(obviously Jennifer Aniston and the others being Dave Herman, voice actor on Futurama and John C. McGinley), everyone's perfect in their roles and even spout some great one-liners too. My favorite: a neighbor, overhearing about Peter's plan gone awry, declines an offer to visit Peter saying "that's ok, don't want you to **** up my life too." The only thing I didn't like is that the character you're going to love to hate never gets a comeuppance, like somebody losing it and punching him. Kind of disappointing.<br /><br />How skimpy on the extras. This "Special Edition" practically has one making-of and deleted scenes and DVD-ROM stuff. No commentary? Grr, which is too bad cause I would've loved to hear from at least anybody but still this is a film that definately warrants a purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>If you are already among all of us working stiffs, pushing buttons for some guy with a fancy car and his own personal parking spot... what ever you do don't rent 'Wall Street'!<br /><br />'Office Space' is one of those few movies that really brings the average day in office to true life. Eventhough there are some overly exageratted scenes in this movie (oh and they are extremly funny), there are so many things I myself pointed at the screen saying 'That happened to me!'<br /><br />This movie is not one to be missed it IS the movie you need to watch when you come home from work. The characters are great, Mike Judge even got the stereotypes correct in the software field. There is always a huge woman sitting at the front desk directing calls, there is always an Indian guy (if you have called Dell computers for assistance you know I am right.) And yes there is always a geekey looking guy who acts like a hot shot, whom you have to lick the scum off of his shoes everyday just to prevent yourself from getting fired.<br /><br />To Mike Judge and the cast of 'Office Space', thank you for showing us all how to stick it to the man because we are all too big of whimps to do it ourselves.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Sometimes the most simple of words say more than a very long review could.

This is one of my all time top ten favorite funny movies.  <p>Overall-Just plain funny, if you haven't already seen it please do so.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I'm not sure it is essential to have worked in an office to enjoy this film, but I'm certain it will hit home for those who have.  The movie was a complete bust at the box office, which utterly mystifies me, because it is hysterically funny and reflects the experience of millions of people across the United States (and I assume elsewhere).  In an age where companies are seeking to lay off workers at any possible opportunity, this film has perhaps even more relevance now than it did when it came out in 1999.<p>The humor of the film works on multiple levels, but for me so much of it is funny with a twist of the knife, for much of the humor hints at a much more serious fact:  modern work is genuinely dreadful and alienating.  Perhaps many office workers love their job, but I hate mine, and I assume that I am merely one of millions.  No one in this film has a meaningful job.  Even Lumbergh, though the boss, has an absurd position.  Peter Gibbons is at least able to be honest about the ridiculousness of his plight during the incredibly funny sequence in which he is hypnotized.<p>The film is a collection of many, many wonderful moments.  I started laughing from the second that Peter Gibbons gets trapped in the traffic jam and is passed by an old man on a walker, and didn't stop until the very end.  The film is a parade of very funny bits, from Michael Bolton and his passion for gangsta rap to Joanna's boss urging her to wear more flair (played by director Mike Judge) to Peter's neighbor who would yell at him through the walls to Peter's bizarre fantasy in which Lumbergh is making love to Joanna holding a cup of coffee in one hand and her ankle in the other to virtually any conversation involving Lumbergh and Milton.  Some of the humor is a bit too broad.  For instance, although I defy anyone not to find Milton's sequences funny as heck, they don't fit in quite as neatly with the satire of the rest of the film.  I wouldn't, however, want to trade them in for a tighter movie.<p>In a way, this movie has made my life easier to live.  I suspected my job was absurd before seeing this film.  Now I know it is.  But somehow knowing the truth makes it easier to get through the day.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>When "Office Space" first came out, I have to admit that the movie did not look very good. The trailers didn't do the movie justice. I didn't see the movie until this past year and that was when I started to appreciate this movie. I work for a huge mortgage company which basically I would not recommend taking out a loan with given the way they treat their customers which is horrible, not to mention their employees too. What I see in "Office Space" is basically a mirror image of the BS I have to suffer at the office on a daily basis. Mike Judge (creator of "Beavis and Butthead") really captures cubical life in "Office Space". Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter Gibbons who begins out in the movie stressing out about everything that is going on at his job but after he is hypnotized (which eventually goes awry), Peter stops giving a darn about his job and starts slouching off. Yet that lazy, sloth mentality of Peter's manages to get him far ahead in the company while other people are being screwed over by the company (which I can definitely relate to). Gary Cole is hilarious as the patronizing, condescending jerk of a boss. His line deliveries cracks me up because they come off sounding pleasant yet the message is not so nice, like coming into the office on the weekends. That I can also relate at my job to which scares me. Stephen Root as Milton was even more hysterical. If anything should be learned from Milton is that be careful of who you push around because you never know what could happen. LOL! I love the pieces of flare that Jennifer Aniston has to wear at a TGI-like restaurant. I cracked up when her boss implied that good employees wears lots of pieces of flare (which are basically cheesy buttons). My most personal favorite moment in the film is the Michael Bolton character who immediately snaps at his cubical neighbor and refers to the pop singer of the same name as "a no-talent @$$ clown". I love "Office Space". Anyone who works for a corporation should really watch this movie. You will find this movie bearing a strong resemblence to your job. I know it does for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I can't say much more that the other reviewers haven't already said. I've seen this movie several times and LOVED it. I worked in an office briefly, and while it wasn't exactly like what was in the movie, I do remember the tedium and boredom, and where I currently work, there's some managers that I just can't respect because of how... stupid they are.<br /><br />Some of the scenes were wonderfully choreographed or written. I loved the printer-smashing scene (which was actually spoofed in 'Family Guy' with Brian and Stewie) and the actors do a great job playing their respective characters, such as Milton Waddams and Michael Bolton. The almost emotionless character of Lumbergh was also rather memorable. I also loved the scene between Jennifer Aniston's character and her manager as they're discussing 'flair'. Overall a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>1999's "Office Space" has become something of a cult classic, with office workers everywhere able to recite their favorite lines from this spot-on comedy.  Ron Livingston stars as Peter, a computer software worker locked into a dreary cubical existance, suffering a condescending and exploitative boss and a meaningless life away from the job.<br /><br />Desperate for a change, Peter tries hypnotherapy.  When the session goes awry, Peter is left locked into a relaxed mode that allows him to cheerfully skip work, chase the girl of his dreams, and subvert the routine of his office.  A consulting team brought in to downside the company becomes the trigger for a fraud scheme hatched by Peter and two disgruntled office mates.  They spring the scheme, only to suffer an attack of conscience (and a fear of jail).  Their ham-handed  attempts to fix things lead to a fateful decision by Peter.<br /><br />The comedy of "Office Space" is in the knowing details, such as Peter's wearisome commute, in which the other lane always moves faster; the office gnome, laid off five years ago but still shuttling from desk to desk because no one told him; and a perpetually malfunctioning printer.  Jennifer Anniston has a nice role as Peter's spunky new girlfriend, while Gary Cole is superbly hateful as Peter's unctious boss.<br /><br />"Office Space" is highly recommended as a classic black comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Long before TV shows like "The Office" and other work comedies "Office Space" hit a cord with most office workers. This 1999 movie pointed out printers that suck, bosses that suck, and employees that suck. It makes the keen observation that employees with backbone and creativity are capable of becoming managers or embezzlers that fear picking up soap in prison. We see three key employees hatch a plan to get enough to retire on once two find out the companies downsizing includes them. The irony is the employee worried about where his office moves and stapler will end up is the one that truly gets even with the boss and company in one fell swoop. This is a reasonably funny movie that has good replayability. Good quality DVD with a few extras on the special edition with flair. If you enjoyed this catch "Employee of the Month" and "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Sort of a real world Dilbert.

Believe me, it's abssolutley hilarious.<br /><br />Peter Gibbons goes to work at Unitech every day and works basically in a cubicle. His friends Michael and Sharim also work with him. Sharim has problems with the copier which he wants to throw out the window, Michael has problems because his name is the smae as a singer (Michael Bolton), and Peter has "a case of the mondays" and just wants to stop working. Their boss is one of the funniest characters with his awesome lines( yeah..... I'm gonna need you to come in tommorow..). Milton is also funny as he is a small nerdy man who isn't receiving a paycheck who is obsessed with his red stapler. The commotion over the stapler is absolutely hilarious! Then, when Peter's friends get layed off, they all join together to rob Unitech of its money even though Peter got a raise for "doing nothing"! (His boss hates him but the consultants love him)<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's love but one of the funniest moments is when one employee gets hit by a car while driving to work. He gets insurance money and gets to retire. He then hosts a party saying how lucky he is even though he is in a wheelchair with both of his legs broken! Absolutely hilarious. I'm not going to give away any more of the millionssssss of jokes but I really reccomend this to anyone in the mood for some good laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>watch this movie!

The actors are amazing, you will be laughing the whole time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Now, Office Space might look like a movie about this young guy whose whole viewpoint on cubicle hell is changed when his occupational hypnotherapist dies in the middle of a hypnosis session, leaving him with a wonderfully carefree attitude toward the job he despises - but it's not.  The real star of this movie is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the mumbling, thoroughly mistreated oddball who is pushed beyond his limits after the boss, among other things, steals his stapler.  He really loved that stapler, which is why he continued to use it after the company went with a completely different stapler manufacturer.  When you're stuck in a cubicle for forty hours a week and forced to watch all sorts of Who Stole My Cheese nonsense taking place all around you, when you're always the odd man out when the boss' yearly birthday cake gets handed out, when you're forced to change cubicles over and over again for no good reason whatsoever, you become Milton.  With no control over your life's direction, you cling to any little thing you can find in your three-walled domain - a favorite stapler, your chair (which you really should put your name on, if you want to make sure someone doesn't pull the old switcheroo on you), and the all-consuming importance of locks for your shelves (which the movie completely leaves out, for some reason).  Your bosses make fun of you behind your back and think of ways to make your life even more miserable, and you start mumbling all the time.  Yes, Milton truly represents those unfortunate enough to be trapped inside cubicle farms.<br /><br />However, since the movie does give young Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) and his buddies most of the screen time, I'll talk about them as well.  That Pete's really got his head on straight as the movie begins; he has already learned that work is a form of torture that makes every day worse than the one before until you get old and die.  His buddies at work are pretty spot-on as well, knowing that the hiring of a consultant means a labor reduction is imminent.  Then Peter sees this hypnotherapist who gets him nice and relaxed, with all of his work-related worries washed away - and keels over dead, leaving Peter in a state that can only be described as carefree.  He just stops going to work for awhile, but when he does pop in (just to pick up his address book), he goes ahead and talks to the two Bobs (the consultants).  His straight-shooting, incredibly honest answers about how little he actually does at the company convince the Bobs that he is upper management material.  While Peter's being promoted, though, his buddies Michael Bolton (David Herman) - no, he's not related to that dreadful singer - and Samir  Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) are being laid off.  That's when Peter comes up with a plan - well, actually, the whole idea was Michael's, but Peter talks him and Samir into actually doing it.  They plant a virus-type routine, designed to skim off a fraction of a cent from every transaction, inside the computer system.  The plan ends up working too well, though, putting Peter and the guys into quite a potential pickle.<br /><br />I think the film sort of loses its focus during the final half hour.  Up until that point, it's a dead-on parody of cubicle life.  You've got your fax machine designed to jam as often as possible, your boss who speaks to you as if you're intellectually challenged and never hears a word you say, a  whole range of annoying co-workers, etc..  The whole "Didn't you get the memo?" routine captures the very essence of life in the cubicle jungle.  A great supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, a waitress who just says no to "flair," and Diedrich Bader as Peter's next-door-neighbor, really round out the film remarkably well.  Even the genius behind the whole film, Mike Judge, joins the fun as Joanna's flair-obsessed manager.  Office Space is just a tremendously funny movie that shines the mirror of hilarious truth on the ridiculous nature of far too many modern companies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This DVD is not bad at all.

It makes you take a second look at Corporate America and see all the flaws it has. Ron Livingston is great as the tired of it worker, while Jennifer Aniston is very likeable as his girlfriend. I thought the whole Michael Bolton thing was hilarious, as was the murdering of the office equipment in the open field. Gary Cole played his role as annoyingly as anyone could have, and John C. McGinley was funny as the new staff hand. This movie should have done well at the box office, but anyone who's seen it knows how good it really is.  This movie is definitely worth having.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Sooner or later, most of us--if we're the slightest bit perceptive--will realize that most of our lives are dedicated to moving grains of sand from one pile to another.

And we've done a wonderful job of creating ornate illusions to make us think that we're doing something important, or at least worthwhile.<p>Office Space takes a nice poke at this illusion of meaning, as a modern day hero, with the help of a dying hypnotist, suddenly decides he just doesn't want to do anything.

Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston give honest and sarcastic performances and Gary Cole, jeez that guy always plays a jerk! The ending was not that great so I can't rave about this 90 minute flick, this is a mixed bag for me, decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>"Office Space" is a great film from the brilliant mind of Mike Judge. Ron Livingston plays corporate drone Peter Gibbons who has a totally unhappy and stressed life. Thanks to the only partially intentional assistance from a therapist using hypnosis in the single funniest scene in the film, Peter relaxes and reaps the rewards of sloth. The films makes a legitimate point about promotion up the corporate ladder in the most humorous manner possible.<br /><br />The characters in the film are all caricatures of idealized cubicle dwellers, and remind me of a cross between "Dilbert" and the cast of "The Office." The film is well acted, and you will see favorite actors from several favorite sitcoms: John C. McGinley from "Scrubs" is brilliant as Bob the consultant; Diedrich Bader from "The Drew Carey Show" is brilliant as a blue collar neighbor, and Jennifer Aniston shines as Joanna, a waitress with flair!<br /><br />The film deserves five stars save for one misstep in postproduction: the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled with extremely violent rap music, which not only fails to enhance the film, it actually detracts markedly from it.<br /><br />If you are willing to face life in a cube farm, you need to face up to "Office Space," and check out the extras, too. The deleted scenes are, in several cases, absolute highlights: the scene where Peter confronts the receptionist is absolutely priceless, and justifies the cost of the film alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>Well, this movie is just as good as a million dollars to me. If you don't love this movie you don't have a funny bone in your body. This movie is just as funny to me today as it was the first time I saw it. Hundreds of viewings haven't watered it down as has happened for me with other films such as Half Baked. No... this is the real deal. Every character is great, every scene is hilarious. This is a perfect movie and I don't think it can ever be topped. 20 years from now I will still be quoting lines from this movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, where have you been? Oh, you simply have to own this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>In my circle of friends there is no film quoted, referenced or talked about as much as `Office Space'.  It is the collective favorite; the one film we can all agree on to have entertained us in every way possible.  Not a week goes by that this film is not mentioned among us and not once do we pass up an opportunity to watch this movie, even if only in part.  For instance, this film has been in rotation on Comedy Central for the past few months and in those past few months my best friend and I have watched this movie, in whole or in part, at least twelve times.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />It's that good.<br /><br />`Office Space' is truly one of the richest comedies I've ever seen.  From the very start to the very end it delivers laugh after laugh, each as genuine as the one preceding.  That I think is the kicker.  Each joke, each gag, each laugh is just as purely entertaining as the last one, none of them fall south or feeling forced.  Each scenario is so real and so relatable that it all becomes all the more hilarious because we feel as though we've been here before.  Who hasn't had the condescending and overbearing boss who just can't seem to take a hint?  Who hasn't had the obsessive compulsive co-working who can't seem to get out of your way?  Who hasn't had that one pesky piece of office equipment that just won't seem to work right?  Who hasn't had that overachieving co-working that just won't seem to get out from under your skin?<br /><br />The point is that `Office Space' could be re-titled `Your Life' in the essence that it is so real and down to earth.  Sure, parts are exaggerated, but are they really?<br /><br />The story revolves around Peter Gibbons, a man who loathes his little cubicle of an office space at his horror show of a job and only wants to be free of the responsibilities of adulthood.  His girlfriend is obviously cheating on him and wants for him to grow up.  His friends all hate their jobs as much as he does but like Peter are too chicken to take any action about it.  This is all until Bob Slydell is hired to evaluate who is really pulling their weight within the company and start making some cut-backs.  This all happens just about the time that Peter is hypnotized and placed under a spell of serenity.  While his friends Samir and Michael are fretting over losing their job Peter is slacking off, showing up late (if at all) and doing his best to upset his boss Mr. Lumbergh.  Then the three friends concoct a plan to end their worrying forever, but of course it's going to backfire.<br /><br />Ron Livingston is brilliantly cast as Peter.  His laid back portrayal of Peter is marvelous.  Ajay Naidu does wonderful things with Samir, but it's David Herman that steals this entire film with his neurotic and aggressive portrayal of Michael Bolton (yup, you heard me right).  Supporting parts played by Jennifer Aniston, Diedrich Bader and Gary Cole are sure to entertain and leave an impression and of course Stephen Roots portrayal of Milton is sure to elicit plenty of laughs.<br /><br />What is really great about `Office Space' is that it's not just out there to bash corporate America but in actuality it attacks the work environment in general.  Sure Peter and his corporate business woes are prominent here but we are introduced to Joanna, Peters love interest, and her struggle with her waitressing job at Chotchkie's, a restaurant chain in the vein of TGI Fridays.  As she battles with her boss obsessed with `flair' and being compared to her co-worker obsessed with kissing up and being teachers-pet so-to-speak we see the ugly side of the workplace from a whole different perspective.  It's such a well rounded comedy that you can't help but appreciate the irony.<br /><br />I can't think of enough good things to say about this hilarious satire.  All I can say is see this movie again and again for optimum enjoyment and laugh your butt off.  You deserve it.  You work all week long and have little to show for it.  It's about time you embrace your own misery and find all the humor there is to find in your puppet dance for the man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I love this movie! I worked at a video store during college, and I reccomended this to all kinds of people. It was one of the few movies that everyone could find something to laugh at while watching it. Peter is an average Joe who hates almost everything about his average office job. When his hyptomism goes wrong, he stops caring, and surprisingly does better at work. When his two friends are laid off the three hatch a plan to get some money out of the company, but nothing works out as planned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>How sad for all of us that the Bill Lumberghs of the world--the men (and women) who most desperately need Office Space--won't be able to "get it."<br /><br />Those of us who do "get it," however, will love this send up of office life. Much like the wonderful series The Office (U.K. version), Office Space tears into the insanity of our working lives with deadly, painful accuracy. It is obvious that Mike Judge has talent with satire, and this film makes me hope that he plans on producing more in this area in the future.<br /><br />Eventually, the movie pushes the satire to the back-burner and concentrates on telling a romance story with Jennifer Aniston. When it does, the movie loses a little steam as their relationship is simply not as interesting as watching characters like Lumbergh, the receptionist or the waiter with the perma-smile on his face.<br /><br />But that aside, this movie is a classic satire that will be quoted by your friends for years to come, and is definitely something that needs to be watched to be clued-in to the culture of modern, working America. A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>From the creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill, brings you a movie that shows in important message in life, "work sucks". The performances in this movie are amazing. They are amazing from performances from everybody. This film is a smart and intellectual film about a day in a life in a hard worker. And how they get mad of all the work they have to suffer through. <p>The story goes as Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) really just doesn't feel like going to work anymore, he really really hates it, and wants to get fired. With his new attitude and his new girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) he gets promoted and still hates his job and wants to make his boss pay for making his life miserable. He then figures a scam with his friends Michael and Samir. It is a triumph! <p>This film has really no special features. It has the theatrical trailer for the film, widescreen anamorphic 1:85:1 ratio, and cast and crew info. They should really come out with a special edition set of this movie. It should have commentary by Mike Judge. But the film still covers it. It is a smart comedy.

I put off seeing it for a long time because I had seen so many other office movies that were awful. This one was pretty good. The ending gets cut off rather abruptly and the outcome was not exactly what I would want -- which is why this movie is so true to life.

He hates everything about his pencil pushing, paper shuffling, numbers crunching job and feels trapped. He hates it so much, that he goes to a 'Occupational Hypnotist' for therapy. But through a tragically, bizarre (and darkly funny) accident he gets a hypnotic suggestion in his brain to no longer give a dam about his job or financial security.With his new found attitude, he basically turns his office upside down.(I love the scene where he guts a fish on his desk!) Along the way, Peter and a pair of frustrated downsized, software engineers (David Herman &amp; Ajay Naidu), conspire to release a computer virus, that will slowly defraud the company of huge sums of money.Unfortunately something goes horribly wrong with the program and the guys must figure out a way to keep the corporate bosses from discovering their crime.When this movie was originally released in 1999 it bombed and quickly left the theatres. But through DVD/video sales &amp; rentals, constant airings on cable television and good 'word of mouth', it became a cult film with a following. I think the reason this comedy resonates within people is because it gets all the details of corporate life... so right. Director-Writer, Mike Judge (Creator of both &quot;Beavis &amp; Butthead&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;) includes everything from the well manicured but dull corporate parks to the mind numbing fluorescent lighting and the earth toned, cage-like cubicals, that you would love to bang your head against.Judge gives us all the characters you almost always find in the corporate hierarchy including the inhuman boss, the evil consultants,the penny-pinching bean counters, the gossips, the worriers, even the engineers, who think they know everything. This movie totally gets it's topic of 'office hell' and just runs with it! The cast is great all around. Standouts include Gary Cole as Lumbergh,the passive-aggresive, boss you'd love to kill and Stephen Root as Milton, a mumbling, put upon employee with a stapler obsession. Even Jennifer Aniston gives a good performance as a flair-impaired, waitress, who hates her job in a 'Fridays' style restaurant.If you work in an office, you will either laugh or cringe... or do both, while you watch this gut-busting, hilarious movie. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>From the opening scene, when Peter Gibbons's (Ron Livingston)freeway-jammed car is outpaced by an old man on a walker, to the Monday-morning showdown between Man and Copier, you know this is gonna be a good movie, and it doesn't disappoint. Anyone who has ever sat in a flourescent-lit cubicle listening to easy-listening music for hours at a stretch, week after week, with nothing to look forward to but more of the same until retirment (assuming you don't get downsized first) can relate to "Office Space" -- a surprisingly good first effort from Mike Judge, the guy who produced the lowest of the lowbrow, Beavis & Butt-Head, and later the more subtle "King of the Hill." The performances are really good all around: Livingston is perfecto as office-shmoe Gibbons, a passive nice-guy programmer stuck in a boring, dead-end office job who has a revelation that sooner or later comes to everyone in a cube: we only have so much time on this earth, and we weren't meant to spend it this way. Shedding his passive ways, Gibbons rebels against evil boss Lumbergh (great performance by Gary Cole) and recruits two pals, the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman -- "Why should I change my name, he's the one that sucks!") and Samir, to help him loot his place of work of a few hundred grand in cash, and sets out to win the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Aniston). The soundtrack, mostly gangsta rap hits by the Geto Boys, is hilariously inappropriate for the setting -- but then again maybe not, since everyone that works at Initech is swallowing a lot of rage (there is a classic scene of skinny computer-nerd Bolton expertly rapping out the lyrics to "The Diary" by Scarface in his car). "Office Space" is a great commentary on the modern workplace, but it is also a (non-violent) revenge fantasy that will speak to anyone who has ever fantasized about smashing a copier with a baseball bat or telling the boss: "It's not that I'm lazy, it's just that I don't care."</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>1 Blu-ray disc, released February 2009<br /><br />Some comedy classics stay fresh forever. This one still wins after eleven years.<br /><br />"Office Space" is a Mike Judge comedy about the cubicle life. There are so many memorable characters! Lumbergh played by Gary Cole who drags out all his sentences and Milton played by Stephen Root who is the squirrelly guy with management issues and a red Swingline stapler.<br /><br />It embodies a fantasy of what many office workers feel their life is like and what they would love to do about it working up to the beat down of the fax machine.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is a new trivia track called "Post-It Pandemonium" where post-its appear on the screen in random places with facts you probably didn't know or ever need to know necessarily...I thought it would be cool but after a while it gets a little annoying since they cover up faces and other stuff on the screen.<br /><br />If you like games, this has a bunch. You can play Grab the Stapler, Printer Beat-Down, Whack-a-Drone, and Jump to Conclusions 2.0. The "Out of the Office" Office Space Retrospective with Writer/Director Mike Judge allows you to see the animation and voices in the cartoon where Milton and Lumbergh originated. It goes over the casting process of how they found each actor and how that actor interpreted their characters and motivations. There are also eight deleted scenes where Peter is being caught in a lie about his whereabouts, Happy hour at the restaurant where Peter talks about the hypothetical no job scenario, Peter goes off on Nina, Peter grandstanding about life and revelations which doesn't make a lot of sense at that moment in his new carefree zen state, etc. As with almost all deleted scenes, the movie is better without them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>This will go down in history as one of the most brutally honestly histerical movies of all time.  I saw this movie back when it was released and it has always resonated as the funniest movie ever, mostly because it pokes fun in the hilarity that is our lives.  There's nothing over the top about this film.  Peter (Ron Livingston) could be you, and you could have his life, and his luck, and thats the greatest part about this movie.  You can relate to the situations that make this film so enjoyable, and yes, hilarious.  Peter works a dead end job at a computerish type company with friends Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Na...Na..."Not gonna work here anymore" and they all hate it there.  There boss Lumbergh (Gary Cole) is a complete pain in the @$$ and Milton (Stephen Root) is well, weird.  (Actually Milton's subplot involving his employment - or lack there of - and his stapler serve as some of the funniest scenes in this film)  Peter's girlfriend Anne left him and he's trying to hook up with Joanne (Aniston) who is waitress at a local 'bennigans' type resterant.  When they finally get fed up with their situation they decide to take action and come up with a scam to rip off the company.  Hilarity ensues as their plan backfires.  David Herman serves as the funniest person here, with his pure hatred for the singer Michael Bolton and life in general.  Diedrich Bader plays Peter's hilarious hillbilly neighbor.  This is a great film that will supply more laughs than not and should be seen by everyone!</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Milton is the funniest movie character in years. Office Space is a pure example of comedic genius. The acting and story line take back stage to outrageous laughs and gags that never fail to deliver.<br /><br />It's honestly the most unreal story in the world, but it's a way that the common man can live vicariously through the actors. Who hasn't wanted to really just sluff off at work? Who hasn't felt underappreciated? Who hasn't thought that the office itself would fall apart if they left?<br /><br />One word of caution to take from this, however.

Ron Livingston is terrific and this is the kind of unique film Jennifer Aniston should do more often (no more Along Came Polly's). I enjoyed Office Space and recommend it to anyone with their own office space that they want to knock down and burn. This is a highly enjoyable and cute film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Anyone who has ever worked in a corporate environment, an environment necessitating the need for cubicles, needs to go out right away and pick up a copy of "Office Space." Created, written, and directed by Mike Judge-the same guy responsible for "Beavis and Butthead"-this 1999 movie perfectly captures the innumerable torments of the modern white-collar worker. The film did poor box office during its theatrical run, but has since become a massive cult classic on video and DVD. It's no wonder. The movie is funny, cynical, and is the only film in my opinion to adequately use rap music to great effect. To give you an idea of how popular this movie has become-my own mother has heard about the movie and made me rent it so she could watch it. Yep, when your own aging mom knows about a movie, you just know it has jumped the boundaries of a narrow audience and become a pop culture phenomenon. For those poor souls who waste the days of their lives imprisoned in a small box in some generic looking office building out in the suburbs, "Office Space" is the best way to channel your rage. It sure beats going postal, at least.<p>Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is the moral and physical center of "Office Space." This young guy works at Initech, one of those late '90's computer tech firms that sprang up across the country like weeds. Peter hates his job, hates his bosses, and hates sitting in his cubicle listening to annoying co-workers. He especially despises Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), a vice-president of the company who takes great pleasure in asking Gibbons to work on the weekends even as he hassles him endlessly about those "TPS" reports. The problems don't stop there, though. Peter's girlfriend is a controlling personality with a decidedly loose sexual reputation. Gibbons trudges through his days, finding solace only in two sympathetic co-workers named Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). His neighbor in the apartment next to his, a construction worker named Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), provides an occasional breath of fresh air as well. Peter Gibbons's life is a complete disappointment, an endless march of days doing nothing more than updating computer programs for Y2K and sitting around in his generic apartment watching Kung Fu. Something has to change before Peter goes off his rocker, and after he visits an occupational hypnotist, it does.<p>After Dr. Swanson (Mike McShane) dies suddenly in the midst of hypnotizing Peter, Gibbons is a changed man. He saunters into work whenever he feels like it, wearing casual clothes and ignoring his bosses. He finally asks out Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a cute waitress working at a restaurant called Chotchkie's, after months of indecision. After a midday fishing trip, Peter guts his catch on a huge stack of TPS reports. Something is definitely wrong with this guy. His friends worry about his reckless behavior, especially with a couple of consultants-the two Bobs-hired by Lumbergh to pare down the company lurking in the background, and try to shake him out of his malaise. Peter is undeterred and, when he learns his antics have actually garnered him a promotion while the consultants consign his two pals to the unemployment line, hatches a plot to bilk Initech out of a boatload of money. Predictably, the plans go horribly long, leaving Peter, Samir, and Michael in a desperate situation. Will the three survive to work another day? Will Peter find the fulfillment he's been seeking for so long? Will Bill Lumbergh ever quit saying "mmkay"? These questions, and many others, will find resolution at the conclusion of "Office Space."<p>I'm not even going to waste time describing in detail the huge number of characters, all of them brilliant, who populate the universe of "Office Space." Obviously, Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) deserves special mention since he constitutes an entire subplot of the movie. Based on a series of short cartoons Judge made for "Saturday Night Live" in the early 1990s, Milton is quite a character. You'll either love him or hate him; I liked some of his shtick (the stapler, the cake), but thought he detracted somewhat from the main plot involving Peter Gibbons. What really stands out in the movie is the immensely quotable dialogue, some of it arguably the best lines in motion picture history (paraphrasing here):<p>"Somebody has a case of the Mondays!"<p>"He [Lumbergh] represents everything that is soulless and wrong."<p>"Ha Ha-he's not related to Bill, is he?"<p>I could go on and on. For instance, the sound Peter makes when he learns from Joanna that she did indeed have a relationship with Lumbergh is priceless: it's the sound a person makes when the very essence of their being is wounded. The fantastic dialogue and horrifically true aphorisms virtually demand repeated viewings of this movie. Everyone who works should own a copy of "Office Space."<p>I've never met anybody who doesn't like this movie. Even my mom got a chuckle out of it. I drop anything I'm doing to watch it whenever it shows up on cable television. It's quite sad the film did poorly at the box office since a sequel, while it probably wouldn't have been as good as the original, could still have been great fun. Unfortunately, the DVD version of the movie is poor, with almost no extras worth mentioning. I'm praying the studio will release a special edition DVD at some point in the future with commentary tracks by Judge, Livingstone, Cole, Herman, Root, and other critical cast members. No other film in recent history deserves such a release more than "Office Space." Yes, it's that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>If only everything that Jennifer Aniston did were this funny. About ten times more humorous than Friends, this movie delivers the laughs consistently and heartily. If you've ever wanted to torture the equipment in your office or tell your boss ...off, this is the movie for you.<p>Funny, funny, funny!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>There's something about a study of life in a "cubicle" to which just about everyone can relate; at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day, go to work and punch a time clock, then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In "Office Space," writer/director Mike Judge (the guy who gave us "Beavis and Butthead") captures the essence of the work-a-day world, in this case in an office setting, though it could be on any job anywhere, from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern; anywhere a "corporate structure" is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judge's vision is funny, and often downright hilarious, and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are, from the weekly "motivational" talks from the boss, to staff meetings, corporate "mission statements" and the protocol of cover sheets and memos, all of which-- as portrayed here-- have a sterling ring of truth to them.  The central character of Judge's story is a guy named Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a software analyst for "Initech," who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind, whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants-- "efficiency experts" sent in to streamline the company's operation-- that he does only about "fifteen minutes of real work" a week, due to the very structure (or lack thereof) of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life, as well as that of a couple of co-workers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peter's life outside the office, as well, which gives the audience even more with which to identify, like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop-- in Peter's lane-- while the cars in the next lane going flying by; and when he changes into THAT lane, IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  It's an application of Murphy's Law that -- while certainly nothing new-- works well within the context of this particular story, in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying, mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out.  Livingston gives a notable performance, giving Peter that sense of the "everyman" who'd like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say, and does it in such a way that it validates Peter's being selected as "Champion of the Cause" as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root (a terrific character actor), as Milton, a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation; and Gary Cole, as Peter's boss, Bill Lumbergh, whose impudent, laconic methods of intimidation, delivered in such a droll manner, make him the boss everybody loves to hate.  The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, the waitress with a minimum of "flare" who has trouble "expressing" herself, according to her boss; Ajay Naidu (Samir); David Herman (Michael Bolton); Richard Riehle (Tom); Joe Bays (Dom); John C. McGinley (Bob Slydell); Paul Wilson (Bob Porter) and Diedrich Bader (Lawrence).  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the "Dilbert" comic strip, "Office Space" works because it effectively puts real people in real situations, and brings you into contact with some characters you're going to recognize; I guarantee that no matter what you do to live, thrive and survive, you've run into these people, worked for them, and alongside them.  It's a case of art reflecting reality, and to Judge's credit he's succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home, without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  It's a film that simply puts the "corporate experience" in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at "the boss," and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>I Love this Movie and all the Characters in it.  I recommend this to anyone who loves good Comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>Office Space highlights the absurdities of the modern day workplace, and the high tech workplace specifically. Everyone at computer software company "Initech" hates their jobs, especially Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who feels trapped in a treadmill of nonrewarding monotonous work as he rewrites and tests other people's software to insure it is Y2K compliant. Simultaneously, he feels equally trapped in a relationship with a woman who treats him like an unsatisfactory employee. Peter represents all of the 25-35 year old white collar workers who know they are not doing what they want to with their lives but simply find initiating a complete career change as too scary, as if anything could be worse than what they are putting up with already.<br /><br />I'm positive that someone involved with this movie has a deep understanding of working in software, because I easily recognized each of the various types of people represented in the cast - even the psychotic coworker, Milton, who keeps coming to work when they move his desk to the basement and stop paying him. Gary Cole's performance of Bill Lundburg hits the bullseye as the boss that understates in a calm voice everything that he wants, but then has no problem firing people if they don't meet his understated demands. What seems like a post-it note is actually a subpoena, in Lundburg's eyes. One of my favorite scenes is when he is having everyone come in and basically beg for their jobs by justifying their positions. One older worker only seems to have one function - to carry the requirements from the requirements writers to the software engineers. When the bosses try to probe more deeply into his skills he gets angry and bellows "Are you blind! Can't you people see I have valuable people skills!".<br /><br />Ultimately, Peter and his coworkers bungle a scheme to embezzle from the company by writing a program that extracts fractions of pennies per iteration. Instead of producing many very small checks, the program winds up producing one huge check that is bound to attract attention. Thus Peter goes to Initech to return the check. His return of the money coincides with psychotic coworker Milton finally making good on his mumblings of "burn down the building". The end result is that, with no Initech to return to, Peter takes a job in construction and realizes he enjoys working outside and with his hands and is thus finally happy in his work. As for Milton, in spite of being without a paycheck for weeks, he seems to mysteriously have found the money to have taken up residence in a tropical resort.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Office Space is from Mike Judge the creator of Beavis and Butthead and the shots he take at coporate America in this film are so true. It's ironic on how close to home this movie hits. I work for FEMA in an office job and this movie is almost like going to work for me in a funny way.<br /><br />Peter(Livingston) hates his job. He has the most annoying boss anybody could ask for and he  drives Peter nuts. Peter can't stand his job and his goal is to do absolutely nothing. He wants to do nothing and so he goes to a hypnotherapist to tell him about his problem. After an accident during the session Peter quickly finds himself stuck in his new dream of euphoria.<br /><br />He likes a waitress a waitress named Joanna(Aniston) who works at the burger coffee join that him and his buddies go to. He gets her to come along in his quest of nothingness.<br /><br />Layoffs are happening at Peters place of employment Intec. He is expecting to finally get laid off, but ends up with a promotion while his two best friends at work are scheduled to get fired. The three refuse to take it and come up with a stratedy to get back at Intec. They come up with a computer program that steals the extra cents from checks when they round down on the numbers in writing them. It's similar to the plot of Superman III. The plan backfires in Peters face and he is also struggling with his relationship with Joanna. He now must fix everything or wind up in jail.<br /><br />The movie is great. A lot of people wont enjoy that much, but for those who work daily office jobs this is one of the greatest movies you'll ever see. We've all wanted to do what Peter does as work in which he just tells everybody how it feels. His boss is such a pefect image of a corporate america boss and it's sad on how true the impersenation is.<br /><br />The actors are all pretty good in the film. There are no stand out roles and you won't be blown away by any performance. You will however love many of this memorable characters including Milton the psycho stapler lover is was the original idea for the whole movie.<br /><br />If you have an office job or have ever had one than Office Space is a must own. Even if you haven't you'll still like the corporae America office humor. You won't want to miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This film is such an accurate satire of today's enclosed corporate environment that it's almost surreal.  It was recommended to me by a couple of colleagues @ work and now I well understand why.  All of the usual office politics, personnel clashes, annoying bureaucracy, ever-present red tape, silly rules / policies and the fixation of management on meaningless matters.<br /><br />While watching this movie I sometimes almost felt like I was AT work myself.  A few of the incidents brought back vivid memories of instances that I've experienced.  I'm sure that most people who work in an office will find a whole lot in this story that they can relate to, just as I did.<br /><br />The one big name in the cast is Jennifer Anniston (big hair and all!) who portrays a fed-up waitress.  She doesn't have too many lines but she is the one bona-fide celebrity who appears on the screen.  I don't recall seeing any of the other actors in anything else.<br /><br />If you're a white color worker (and perhaps even if you're not a white color worker) then this film is certainly worth a look.  I would especially recommend it to persons in management as they just MIGHT understand how foolish they look in front of the working bees whenever they make stupid decisions.

Ron Livingston is Peter, one such cube dweller at Initech, a corporation we never learn much about (I think they develop banking software).  It's not important, of course, because Initech looks and feels like so many offices in so many industries all across America.  Bored to tears at his job Peter undergoes hypnosis at a therapist and suddenly snapping out of his routine, breaking up with his corporate girlfriend.  He goes into a peaceful, carefree sort of trance where he coasts through work until two "consultants" (who signal the coming of layoffs) determine he's just not being challenged enough at work.  Meanwhile, Peter's more productive friends are cut away on recommendation of their slimy manager, Bill Lumbergh, played by Gary Cole with such nauseating, weasle-like smarminess that you've seen less talented people get Oscars for smaller roles.  The trio of friends, tired of being the little guys, hatch a scheme to funnell money slowly and secretly from Initech.  Meanwhile, a neurotic coworker slowly cracks as his desk is moved farther and farther away from everyone else...<p>Office Space is a must for anyone who has ever worked in an office.  Sat at a cubicle.  Wanted to take a fax machine into an open field and beat it with a bat while blasting Ice Cube.  It captures American corporate microculture perfectly, laughing in the face of being micromanaged to death.  But it touches on unversal elements and the laughs are steady, captured in the details like the boss everyone hates, or rap music in suburbia.  A shame this got such a small theatrical release; it found a nice following on tape and DVD.<p>Here's a small, low budget film delivering laughs and some wicked humor.  This is Mike Judge directing but it's not Beavis and Butthead by a longshot.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVNA57PI4DLV.html">ACVNA57PI4DLV</a><br/><p>Peter is a cubicle worker who goes to see a hypno-therapist with his girlfriend and, as the therapist dies on the spot, is never awakened from his blissfull state. Subsequent events conspire to promote him, and with his two laid-off co-workers, he elaborates a plan to get rich : while uploading files for the Y2K problem, they include a virus-like program that takes rounded-off dimes from bank operations and puts them in their account, thus making them rich. But everything goes wrong, of course.<p>Office Space is definitively a hilariously funny comedy, from which it is difficult to extract boring or flat scenes. It is also a refreshing satire of anti-social views about the workplace, in a movie world where hatred of all things corporate is commonplace (which is to be expected, I suppose, given that no one in Hollywood needs to work in cubicles for a living, so they can badmouth it all they want). This is a very precious movie. Its only main problem is being too short - I was left off wanting more !

And sure enough, the movie started off pretty well, highlighting the petty nonsense that makes office work wretched: daily traffic jams, cutesy co-workers, malfunctioning machines, smarmy bosses and pointless work. And many of the film's catch phrases have made it into office usage -- the infamous "TPS" report and "'Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays!"<br /><br />The film deals with Peter Gibbons, a young programmer who hates his big corporate job. At the instigation of his overbearing girlfriend, he attends a hypnosis session that ends prematurely, leaving him in a blissful state of nonchalance. At work the next day, Gibbons blithely ignores all rules of office and social etiquette. He arrives in casual clothing, plays Tetris all day, removes his cubical walls and asks a cute waitress out to lunch. His newfound lack of caring is perceived as freshness and candor by a couple of efficiency experts bent on reducing headcount.<br /><br />Yet at this point, halfway through the movie, "Office Space" lost its charm and gains lots of loosely-connected subplots. The hypnosis gimmick that drove the first half is suddenly and inexplicably dropped. The film morphs into comic romance between Gibbons and a waitress played by Jennifer Aniston. Gibbons and a couple of coworkers hatch a harebrained scam to revenge themselves on the company, and that threatens to land them all in the pokey. Aniston argues with her boss, a restaurant manager who expects his staff to be perpetually peppy, with lots of "flair" decorating their uniforms. All of this activity adds up to very little in the end.<br /><br />For its hits and magic moments, "Office Space" had plenty of misses. Richard Riehle's "Tom Smykowski" is a google-eyed, acne-scarred old timer whose panicked mumbling and emotional attachment to office supplies came across as kind of sad. I guess I've known too many real people like him who were marginalized and then forced out of corporations. The soundtrack consists (pointlessly) of quite foul rap music. A subplot about a malfunctioning office machine manages only to be confusing. The satire of peppy theme restaurants lacks punch. As an office worker myself, I was disappointed by the missed opportunities to lampoon office life. Only one character -- Gibbons' blue-collar neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader) is memorable, consistent and likable.<br /><br />"Office Space" has contributed more than its share of catch phrases and characters. But its inconsistent characterizations, sloppy plotting, unrelenting vulgarity, gratuitous female nudity and misfiring satire made it as annoying is it was funny. It's a 2-star movie that gains a star (I hate to say it) for pervasive cultural relevance. Watch it, even if only to understand the references your colleagues are making.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam, worked next to someone loud and annoying, had a boss from Hell.

Ron Livingston stars as Peter; a man so stuck in his cubicle at his dead end job that he undergoes hypnosis and decides not to do anything at all.  As he puts it best later on in the film: "It's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care."  When company downsizing starts, he surprisingly ends up getting promoted, but when his two friends are in line to be laid off, they hatch a scheme to skim funds from the company's accounts.  The film itself is laugh out loud hilarious from beginning to end, thanks to the great screen play and Judge's excellent direction.  The rest of the cast is perfect as well; including Jennifer Aniston as Peter's new girlfriend, Gary Cole as Peter's smarmy jerk boss, Diedrich Bader as Peter's hilarious mullett headed neighbor, and a scene stealing Stephen Root as Milton; the company's constantly pushed around and neglected mumbling employee whose trials and tribulations you'll bust a gut laughing at.

I believe the reason being - majority of us have to work and many are not very happy with their jobs or job environment. If asked, everyone may recall to having a boss from hell, to be annoyed by changing every week TES (Time Entering System), by the printer or copy machine that seem to hate you and break on you every time you need to print or copy something. Well, with all recognizable funny and sad details of the modern office environment that show Judge's observant eye and wicked sense of humor, the movie is not a great one and not always a good one. It is an average comedy that had interesting potentials but is too long for its length and loses its steam somewhere after first thirty minutes. It's got too many subplots and supporting characters that were neither interesting, nor necessary, for example, the romance between Peter and a local waitress (Jennifer Aniston). A moneymaking scheme that Peter and his friends devise belongs to the different movie and Peter's transformation in the end does not seem to be plausible. I was happy for Milton though. :)<br /><br />6.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Office Space (Mike Judge, 1999)<br /><br />It has seemed that over the years since this relatively obscure little movie came out, it's enjoyed a growing popularity simply on word of mouth. Pretty much everyone I know makes multiple references to it in just about every work-related conversation I've had. One it started showing up in commercials, I figured it was time to get around to seeing it. And while I didn't think it was awful, I have to wonder what those who say "if you've worked in this environment, you'll think this is the funniest movie ever" were smoking when they saw it. It's mildly amusing, but nothing special.<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock for seven years, the plot: Peter Gibbons (Standoff's Ron Livingston), a drone at a large corporation, is just living day to day, doing nothing but working, obsessed with Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at the local sports bar, with his only social interaction outside the workplace being with his somewhat psychotic neighbor Lawrence (well-known voice actor Diedrich Bader) when they talk through the thin walls of their condos. The company brings in a pair of efficiency experts, Bob (John C. McGinley) and Bob (Paul Wilson), and something snaps; Gibbons decides to simply neglect his job. Needless to say, the second he does this, his supervisor, Bill (Gary Cole) calls for his head, and the efficiency experts decide he needs to be promoted to upper management. And things just get weirder from there.<br /><br />It's not a bad film, really-- I just don't think it lives up to the incredible hype that it's now almost impossible to see this movie without experiencing. You will likely be told that it's the best thing since sliced bread, and that if you don't find it the funniest movie you've ever seen, you just don't get it. Not true. Remember, Mike Judge is the guy behind Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill; if you were never a fan, this probably isn't going to change your mind. Still, it is true that if you work in an office environment, you'll either identify with or recognize a lot of these people, and that goes a long way towards redeeming some of the jokes that don't quite cut it. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I've seen this film twice, and I have to admit, it's nowhere nearly as good as many of its fans claim.  It feels undernouirshed and way too episodic.  The director, Mike Judge, came from TV, and it has a TV feel to it, as opposed to a cinematic feel.  The film doesn't flow at all.  The scenes go awkardly from one to the next.  However, there are some priceless moments (the conversation about "flair", Ron Livingston's great line about work (ain't exactly missing it), the destruction of the copy machine), but all these moments are actually in the trailer.  A lot of times between gags the film seems to be killing time, and the film ends up being very boring.  Some might argue that office work is boring (it is), but still, a realistic portrayal doesn't always translate into great filmmaking.  The performances here are first rate, with the underrated Gary Cole giving a hilarious one as Ron Livingston's boss.  Livingston himself makes a great sad sack and Jennifer Aniston is nice as the waitress who is Ron's love interest.  It's not the deepest romance ever, but it passes the time.  The film is not a disaster, far from it, but it is overrated and not a great comedic gem.  Still, there are very funny moments which make it worth watching at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>Despite its status as a modern "cult classic" and its frequent replays on cable TV, many people have still not seen Office Space, one of the funniest movies of the 1990s.  Written by Mike Judge (best known for his television work on Beavis &amp; Butthead and King of the Hill), Office Space is a spot-on spoof of what it is like to work in corporate America at the end of the twentieth century.  Ron Livingston plays a Peter Gibboons, a young professional at a software company who is utterly drained by his Dilbert-like existence.  During a hypnotherapy session, he expresses a phrase which crystallizes the work-life of hundreds of thousands of Americans: "ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life."<p>In notable supporting roles are: Jennifer Aniston as Peter Gibbons' girlfriend who works as a waitress in a vaguely familiar restaurant where "flair" is more important than service; Stephen Root as Milton, the useless, overlooked, middle-aged employee who no one has the guts to fire; Gary Cole as passive-aggressive VP Bill Lumbergh, whom Livingston's Gibbons rightly declares "represents all that is soulless and wrong;" Diedrich Bader as Lawrence, Livingston's crude, simple next door neighbor that ultimately shows Gibbons the path to self-fulfillment; and John C. McGinley as one of the Bobs, consultants who have been called in to put a band-aid on the company's problems by doing a time and labor study.  <p>Some of the film's cruder moments with Lawrence &amp; office colleague Drew hearken back to Judge's B&amp;B days, but overall, this is an insightful &amp; wildly entertaining movie that manages to crystallize into 89 minutes the dehumanizing effect corporate America has had on American culture around the turn of the millennium.  Not only does the film speak satirical volumes about corporate America, but it also has great insight into the way human beings respond when they are marginalized and subjugated, particularly the liberation that retaliation brings.<p>As for the DVD itself, one can only hope that Fox will someday release this masterpiece in a better edition.  The opening menu pops up with an error message that your computer has a virus, a joke that is not funny under any circumstances.  The only special feature on the disc is the theatrical trailer.  Most blatantly absent is a commentary track from the mastermind, director, and uncredited actor in this comedic tour de force.

Everyone can relate to the story, because at one time or another, you have hated your job and wanted to do something about it. The characters in this movie, actually get to live out that fantasy.

David Herman and Ajay Naidu are extremely good as well. However Gary Cole gives the film's best performance as Bill Lumberg. "Uh Yeahh Peter...What's Happening." He goes out of his way to make the employees miserable, from having them work on the weekend, to stealing poor Milton's stapeler, and moving him into the basement. Jennifer Aniston does a nice job as well. Watching her fight with her boss over the pieces of "flair" is priceless. The two Bob's played by John C. McGinley and Paul Wilson are hilarious! Last but not least is Stephen Root as Milton. His obsessions with his stapeler and his overall personality will make you laugh and feel sorry for the guy. <p>"Office Space" is a comedic masterpiece. We can all relate to the story, the laughs are non-stop, and all of the actors are fantastic. My only question is - Why couldn't FOX put out a better DVD? With how funny the movie was, you know there had to be tons of outtakes, and plenty of deleted scenes. So where are they? There are absolutely no special features whatsoever. To make things even worse, the presentation of the film itself was barely above average. This may be the one time that you should go with the VHS version of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>This is almost a live-action Dilbert movie.  This film takes a look at modern corporate culture and lampoons it.  If you have ever worked in a cubicle, this movie will strike a chord within you.  Whether you are seeing the consultants, or efficiency experts, interview people before the lay-off; listening to the sing-song voice of the customer service representative, or watching the employees get mad at the fax machine; this will all seem eerily familiar.<p>Quite a few of the scenes nod to other movies of popular culture, as well as sate our thirst for revenge against work.  This mixture makes from some memorable images.  The camera work used as the conspirators initiate their plan or "celebrate" their lay-off is hilarious.<p>My problem with the film is that it feels great as a series of short films, but as a whole movie, it doesn't hold up as well.  Although Mike Judge (who wrote, directed, and acted here) forecasts what would happen in the end, it still feels like "deus ex machina."  It feels like he couldn't think of how to end it, so he just threw this in.  It does take some suspension of disbelief.  The argument between Peter and his girlfriend also seems a little contrived.<p>All in all, this is a funny movie.  I would recommend seeing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite comedies.  Why?  Because it's not one of those movies that only relies on tired and crude offensive sex jokes and gross out humor.  (And yes, those are fine as well.  You'll notice that I didn't really have a problem with "Freddy got Fingered."  It just gets overplayed too much.)  The movie is actually ingenious with a great story, plot, and a terrific cast of characters.<p>Peter Gibbons is living through Hell twenty-four-seven.  He works for a corporation that has eight bosses barking orders at him everyday.  It seems like it just gets worse everyday.  Well, that all changes when his eyes are open and his mind is at ease.  He realizes that the answer to his solution is to not care anymore.  And that's exactly what he does.<p>I loved everything about this movie.  All of the characters are unique in each way.  But I must say, Milton steals the show.  The mumbling man is played by the very hillarious Stephen Root.  He really is the show-stopper.  Keep a close eye on him.<p>This movie is so realistic, it hurts.  Especially if you work at that kind of an environment.  Come on, how many times have you been stuck in traffic and it seems like everyone is moving except for the people in your lane?  This movie takes all of the elements that take place at a work place and magnifies it a hundred times over.  It's so funny....it's painful to watch at times.<p>The DVD could've been better.  No eye-popping special features.  It's a shame, since this is such a great movie, and is loved by a lot of people.  Still, it's the CONTENT that counts.  The picture and sound quality was really good.<p>"Office Space" is a hillarious laugh-riot that will hook you from the start.  Check it out as soon as you can.  In a world filled with terrible comedies, it's refreshing to know that good ones still exist and are still being made.  See this movie!  Chances are you will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I saw the bonus features&didn't really get the Hype of this film.Any film with Jennifer Aniston alone means the film is gonna lose some points because you the acting is gonna be kinda weak.i got some things of the film,but on a whole I didn't get what all the Hype was about.it had some funny moments,but it was fairly predictable to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I do not for the life of me understand all the hype surrounding this movie. Why does everyone love "Office Space" so much? There were a few times when I chuckled here and there, but overall this movie just is NOT funny. I do not recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Gary Cole is the heart and soul of Mike Judge's Office Space. His portrayal of Bill Lundberg (SP?) is so dead-on it is just hilarious to watch. Ron Livingston plays Peter Gibbons, an everyday 9 to 5 computer programmer for Initech. He hates his job and the whole rat race that surrounds it. In fact, all he really wants to do is watch Kung Fu with his super hot girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. So after being somewhat hypnotized during a therapy session, Peter decides to just stop going to work or going on his own terms which leads to hilarious results. Peter's cadre of co-workers include his underappreciated buddies Samir and Michael Bolton. When Peter learns that Initech plans to fire Samir and Michael, they hatch a scheme to rip off the company. If you've ever hated your job or felt trapped in a terrible company then you will definitely relate to Office Space. You may also recognize Milton (the office psycho) as the nerdy fat guy from dodgeball. Milton loves his red swingline stapler and playing his music at a reasonable volume. Diedrich Bader is also hilarious as Peter's neighbor Lawrence. Anyway, this movie is laugh out loud funny and a great addition to any DVD collection. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Office Space is a brilliant parody of life in corporate America.  While funny, the movie conveys the soullessness of commuting to work, putting in 8-10 hour days doing tasks you hate for a boss you hate even more, only to have to wake up the next day -- sometimes on weekends -- and do it all over again.  Even though it's clearly a comedy, Office Space has caused me to stop and consider (more than once) how I want to spend my work days.<br /><br />The comedy is brilliant.  There aren't too many movie scenes funnier than Peter, Michael and Samir exacting their revenge on a bothersome piece of office equipment.  The rest of the movie hums along at a great clip, lampooning the sameness of office and service industry job environments.<br /><br />The humor is a bit raw in spots.  If you are concerned about language, Office Space has its fair share of "F-bombs". Unlike some movies that need raunch to carry them, Office Space would be funny as a PG flick.<br /><br />Office Space is one of the best comedies of the last decade. Watch it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>With over five hundred reviews there has to be more than a few cubicle drones who've vented their frustrations.  I don't work at one of those industrial park tech firms as portrayed here but I may as well.  I have suffered more than my share of Hawaiian shirt Fridays and mandatory birthday parties than I care to count.  This film is catharsis, even wish fullfilment, for anybody stuck in a dead-end job counting away the brain cells that are eroding from their person.  Director-writer Mike Judge gets so many details right here from the insipid "Cathy" cartoons hanging in the cubicles to the malfunctioning office equipment that seems to have a personal vendetta against you.  Ron Livingston is spot on as Peter the Everyman who just wants to take this job and shove it.  Jennifer Aniston gave me a newfound respect for waitresses at strip mall eateries.  Gary Cole is spot on as the most insufferable boss you ever had.  Stephen Root gives an inspired account of the office sociopath that everyone tends to ignore.  I remember when this film first came out it barely had a run.  Fortunately for us through home video this film has a growing following.</p></br></body></html>

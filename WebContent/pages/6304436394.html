Antonio Banderas is back in this sequel, but the movie hardly lives up to the expectations produced by the first film.<br /><br />The casting is very good, but the plot is just average.  Salma Hayek, though an asset in any film, portrays a mere memory... to the point that it wouldn't have made that big of a difference if she was absent altogether; if anything, it probably would have been better that way.<br /><br />Despite its flaws the movie does have that strongly Mexican flavor and that distinct humor which has become so characteristic of these films.  (The scene with the "Mexi-can" and the "Mexi-can't" was hilarious!)<br /><br />Both Johnny Depp and Antonio Bandera as well as the rest of the cast do a very good job in trying to cover up for the mediocre plot.<br /><br />Overall, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a good film to watch, but not to expect any masterpiece in the making.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>The joke is wearing thin, folks..What joke? The one about making a b-movie with an expensive cast and then overhyping it to surrealness through trailers and press reviews trying to make it seem as the next "Godfather".<p>  There's no doubt that Rodriguez (that would be the guy who tried to direct this) has a knack for putting together very original action scenes. Then again, I've seen sport-shoe commercials with great action scenes but i don't consider them vehicles of greatness, if you get my drift. Back to Rodriguez, there's a scene towards the beggining of the film, that involves an improbable escape from a window of 5-storey building from 2 people who are chained together. Stretched by the hair to be sure, but nevertheless very imaginative especially when they go crash-landing onto a moving bus passing underneath without even registering a scratch or without losing any make-up.<p>  That's basically how the whole flick flows. Exaggerations upon more exaggerations, shoot'm up and shoot'm down, hey throw in some good ole pointless explosions, let some extras run about while someone from the cast (don't matta who) mows them down in droves, get a nicely tanned cast for the necessary pseudo-sex appeal, and voila! You've got a Mariachi to go with extra cheese please.<p>  Now, if you're the type of viewer that adopts an attitude such as:<br />-to hell with the plot, lemme just turn off my brain for a couple of hours, and watch a shootathon gone berserko<p>  then this is definetely THE movie for you. You found it, you deserve to watch it. Anybody else however might be slightly dissapointed and just a tad bored. Your age might play a role in the equation as well (but that's not a lock...).<p>  Other than that, forgive me for being ignorant in the art of movie-making, but what is a cast like that doing in an utter b-movie like this??? J.Depp does try but as far as i know (and i dont know much) b-movies don't look good on anybody's resume. A.Banderas does what he does best which is using his hair very effectively, W.Dafoe hides (wisely) behind a mask in the vague hope he won't be recognised, and Mickey Rourke adds another long nail in the coffin of a career buried in the depths of the 80s...<p>  There are other actors too, but they serve as target practice mostly.<p>  What i loved most about this majorly forgettable joke-on-celluloid was the hilarious attempt of the scriptwriter to put some philosophical lines in the mouths of the sufefring actors. The result of this effort was the type of philosophy you hear in toothpaste commercials: "because your teeth deserve a better tomorrow". I do have  a lingering suspicion that the scriptwriter was not a Taoist.<p>  Lastly, why 2 stars then for such a wreck? Well, I feel forced to acknowledge that Rodriguez did an incredible job giving the word "exaggeration" a whole new meaning. When i saw J.Depp having gone blind and still outshooting his opponents ..without blinking, i thought "wow, this tops it all"...<p>  A grandiose b-movie yes, that will still fail to make the top-10 of it srespective category.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>After a couple of average DVD releases, "Desperado" finally gets the SPECIAL EDITION treatmant. The second and most popular in Robert Rodriguez's "Maricahi" trilogy takes a far different approach from its independent predacessor. As Robert explains on the audio commentary, his goal was always to make a low-budget movie that looked like a "big summer blockbuster" and few can deny that he acheived that goal. <p>"Desperado" has Antonio Banderas taking over the Carlos Gallardo role as the mysterious loner with the guitar case full of guns. He is looking to avenge the death of the women he loves at the hands of a Mexican drug cartel. Along for the ride is an ensemble cast which includes Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, and Danny Trejo. All of these actors pale in comparison to sexy young newcomer Salma Hayek who steals the movie in her major film debut as a librarian who eventually becomes Antonio's love interest. <p>"Desperado" is one of the finest action films to be released in awhile. Only John Woo's "Face/Off" comes to mind when thinking of films released since that have been able to successfully mix stylish action sequences with great dramatic moments. The soundtrack, organized by Robert himself, and consisting a number of Tito & Tarantula tracks, really adds to the atmosphere of the film. Rodriguez has a lot of fun with a story that is esentially a Western genre film and pumps it full of amazing action scenes, hip dialouge, stunning actors, and a soundtrack that compliments it so well. <p>This is by far the best version to drop on DVD yet though it could have stood to include a little bit more behind-the-scenes footage. The director's commentary by Rodriguez is inciteful and the featurette chronicling the "video storyboarding" of the bar shoot-out is impressive but it would have been nice to hear some of the cast look back at the filming of this movie and perhaps, the inclusion of some deleted scenes would have put it over the top. All in all, you really can't complain. It is a quality DVD presentation of an excellent action film.</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) is back, he's in a bizarre stupor, and he's ready to exact his revenge on the general (Gerardo Vigil) that killed his girl, Carolina (Salma Hayek).  But this is just one of the many plots in this movie.  <p>Barillo (Willem Dafoe), the drug lord in this latest installment in the 'Mariachi' series, has hatched a plot to remove the Mexican President (Pedro Armend&aacute;riz Jr.) from power by staging a coup, headed by the same general El Mariachi wants to kill, General Marquez.  But CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) isn't about to let this happen, or something like that.  So, he has contracted with El Mariachi to kill General Marquez.  However, Sands is betrayed by another agent and in the end it all comes down to the mysterious Mariachi (a.k.a. El), his henchmen, and a retired FBI agent to stop Barillo and General Marquez.<p>My Comments:<br />I'm actually amazed I'm giving this movie as good of a rating as I am because the story isn't at all coherent.  But despite the incoherencies, it has some redeeming qualities that make this an engaging film.  <p>First, as far as the story goes, I think my summary illustrates that there is a loosely developed plot underlying the movie, but what is missing from my summary are the haphazard cuts from one subplot to the next as the story tries to develop.  Incorporated into the larger story are a number of intentional throwbacks to the earlier films in the series.  For instance, there is a sequence in which El Mariachi and Carolina slide down a wire onto a moving vehicle which mirrors a nearly identical sequence in the original El Mariachi.  Also, the boy with the bike is also a throwback to the original El Mariachi as there was also a pudgy boy on a bike in that film.  There are probably even more sequences that integrate the films (the opening scene is nearly identical to the opening scene in Desperado), but I haven't watched the movies that closely (I don't think they warrant it).  So, perhaps some of the haphazard cutting and loose story structure can be justified based upon the intent to incorporate these throwbacks.  But in the end, you pretty much just have to admit there isn't a very clear or engaging plot driving this film.<p>Even with the nearly incoherent story line, I found myself engaged with the movie. But what was engaging me wasn't the story - it was the commentary on action films and some of the subtler points of the film.  Let me explain.  I'm basing my opinion of this movie on the assumption that it was intentionally trying to mock action films.  If it wasn't, then this is really a terrible movie.  But if it was trying to mock action films, then it does a great job.  There are so many ridiculous shoot out sequences and so many people that are killed for no apparent reason, that you can't help but laugh.  So, if you watch this movie with that perspective, you should actually enjoy it. However, I should note that this commentary/mocking quality loses its edge by the end of the film.  After the 700th time you see some guy get shot and fly about 40 feet through the air as the result of being hit by a 9mm bullet, it gets old.<p>Another key factor to enjoying this film is Johnny Depp.  As a Depp fan, I always recommend people watch him closely, but in this film he is hands down the greatest redeeming quality.  I'm still laughing at the scene in which he was wearing the C.I.A. shirt.  He was a C.I.A. agent working in Mexico and wearing a shirt that clearly identified him.  Brilliant humor!  There are a few weaker sequences, but for the most part Depp is the only actor carrying this story.  Even Banderas, whose extreme close-ups seem to last interminably long, pales in comparison to Depp. I should also note that even though Selma Hayeck is headlined in this movie, her role is pretty peripheral.  After all, she starts the movie dead.  She is only seen in dream sequences that play out in the Mariachi's head.  The rest of the cast is okay, but not particularly brilliant.  <p>Overall, I'm impressed at what that one $7,000 dollar film did for Robert Rodriguez's career.  But I'm really beginning to hope he's gotten El Mariachi out of his system.  The fact that El Mariachi was vying for the lead actor role in this film is somewhat revealing - there's only so much you can do with guitar cases and weaponry and I think Rodriguez has done it all and then some.  If he can't come up with a clear story to culminate this series, I'd recommend he look for another project (and please, not another installment in the Spy Kids series; it's beginning to feel like Rambo or Rocky).  If you've seen the movies leading up to this one, you may enjoy it.  You may also enjoy it if you like Depp and approach this film expecting it to be mocking of action films.  Otherwise, I don't think I'd recommend this it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>In Hollywood the condition of the hero changes from decade in decade. It's not a mere casualty in the Thirties until the first half of the Forties, the role of the hero was substituted by the antihero: Gary Cooper and Clark Gable were the genuine ambassadors in this aspect.  In the second half of the forties, John Wayne becomes the legendary hero in the far West. In the Fifties the anti hero returns with several faces; the new generations emerged after the bloody WW2 found in James Dean, Montgomery Clift, Lee Marvin and Marlon Brando the expression of rebelliousness and anti conformism; and while Humphrey Bogart, Richard Widmarck and William Holden in the first half and then Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman and Lee Marvin became hard to die schemes of non conformist individuals represented the dark side of the moon respect the ambiguities and desolation of the Cold War, for the adults who lived in own flesh the horror of the War; Cary Grant, James Stewart, Gregory Peck and Ernest Borgnine were the good guys. But there was a third way, still unexplored; the mythic hero that found in Kirk Douglas the perfect personage. In the sixties, Steve Mac Queen, Jon Voight assumed the role of the wanderer. The Seventies in the first half were two urban heroes in their respective forties emerged: Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson; the second half of the Seventies was represented by Sylvester Stallone (the humble hero) and directly from Australia Mel Gibson (Mad Max) embodied the role of the future hero. The Eighties returned with imported figure of a new vision of antihero of intergalactic origin: Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Command and Predator) Harrison Ford ( through the most emblematic films of that decade Blade runner) Al Pacino, Robert de Niro, Chuck Norris, Wilhelm Defoe (Platoon) and Kevin Costner (The untouchables and Silverado) in law's defense. But with the Nineties perhaps initiated the acidic mockery of this genre, you should remember three films that revitalize and sharp the antihero (Dance with wolves and The unforgiven and American Beauty), featured by Bruce Wills' bitter gaze (in Die hard I, II and III, Mercury rising and Armageddon), Keanu Reeves (Matrix) or John Travolta (Pulp fiction) and finally Mel Gibson would feature the role of the tragic hero in "Brave heart"  while the actual decade would seem have found a new revival in Russell Crowe (Gladiator) and Brad Pitt (Achilles in Troy).<br /><br />Smartly Robert Rodriguez knew about the orphanage around the essence of the hero in the Latin American universe, and then proceeded to represent in Antonio Banderas (The appropriate emblem of the new generations) supported by an exceptional cast featuring Johnny Depp as an irreverent and even surrealist agent from the CIA, a dark and sinister  personage (Wilhelm Defoe) in a extremely blooded film, that essentially availed the whole meaning of the violence in the most strict sense conferred by Sam Peckinpah (The wild bunch) in what concerns to present heroes without past and very doubtful future, absolutely not related with the values of the civilization. Remember the last wish of The Mariachi when responses to his wife "To be free" as his supreme aspiration and undeniable bliss.<br /><br />Visually stunning provided of a devilish, engaging, energetic and frenetic rhythm.<br /><br />The only default: Enrique Iglesias (who pitifully was the only (actor?) who looked absolutely unfocused and seemed to be in a video clip instead a real movie, what a mess!)</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>What can I say.  'Desperado' is an over-the-top, ultraviolent comedy starring handsome Antonio Banderas, beautiful Salma Hayak and 'Up in Smoke', Cheech Marin.  Generally speaking, I'm no fan of action-adventure but this particular 'action-adventure' is purely hilarious.  Antonio Banderas is the 'Biggest Mexican I ever saw,' whose face is always obscured by shadows.  Nobody's safe.<br /><br />My favorite scene, though, was of Salma Hayak strutting across a street in Zaragossa, Coahuila.  Cars collide all around her.  She smiles knowingly.  It's the impact she always has on men.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This movie a very entertaining, stylish, shoot-em-up. south-of the border film. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek were both made for this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>How does one go about describing a movie so rarely ideal in every way?  Well, I'll do the best I can.  'Once Upon A Time In Mexico' is a fun movie.  It's "over-the-top" action is entertaining and sometimes humorous.  Johnny Depp as Sands has gone over-the-top with his character also, a US agent (CIA?) infiltrating the Mexican cartels.  (Rumor has it that Depp picked out his own dorky costumes for the role)  He wants someone to kill Marquez, because Marquez is planning to kill the president, so he meets up (forcefully) with El Mariachi (played by Antonio Bandares).  El Mariachi is a nickname, a legend, and supposedly a dead man.  Sands makes a deal with El to kill Marquez, while Sands decides to kill the cook in a tiny Mexican dive because he cooks his pork dish too well - Sands has to restore balance to the country, you see.  But Sands has done well with his choice of El, because it was Marquez who killed El's wife and daughter, and almost killed him.<br /><br />Cartel boss Barillo is played by Willem DaFoe, and his sleazy sidekick Billy is played by Mickey Rourke.  They also are involved in the plan to assassinate the President of Mexico.  Sands goes after retired FBI Agent Jorge to take out Billy and Barillo.  Does it sound complicated yet?  Yes, it is - and no, it isn't.  Basically, there's a plot to overthrow the government and everyone is involved.  'Once Upon A Time in Mexico' is the sequel to 'Desperato', but can be watched separately and stand on it's own.  It's actually much better than 'Desperato', with a lot more cheap action added.  (As a note, the scene with El Mariachi and Carolina (Salma Hayek) going out the window of a five story building chained together was shot with the actual actors and NOT stunt doubles)<br /><br />The pace is fast, furious, and fun, with lots of gunfights and bloodshed and over-the-top action.  Combined with a great cast, it gives this little adventure enough 'Ummph' to make it past mediocre into lively and well-done entertainment.  'Once Upon A Time in Mexico' is pure amusement; it has no other redeeming value.  No deep messages and no artistic awe.  It's definitely a popcorn movie, a movie to gawk at and laugh and squeal with anticipation.  Go ahead, have some fun and watch 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico'.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Lots of good action scenes.<br />*Very excellent, solid filming style and quality.

I love this movie.  The trailers enticed me with Salma Hayek, and I had loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1">Desperado (Special Edition)</a>. Therefore I caught this on the big screen, then rented it...then I knew I had to purchase the film.<br /><br />Oddly, I rooted for Antonio Banderas all throughout <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZTY">El Mariachi (Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1">Desperado (Special Edition)</a>, and the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WN140">Once Upon a Time in Mexico</a>...then along came Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.<br /><br />Although I must fault Sheldon Jeffrey Sands for allowing his ego to overwhelm his good judgment, and his nether regions to overrule his brainpan, he is the man.  A bit too smug, his Ego sometimes screws up his plans.  Yet I am hoping for a comeback.<br /><br />If they want us to root for "the good guy," they can't make "the bad guy" so damned cool.

Antonio Banderas plays the outstanding role of a man with great respect for life and love, yet troubled by memories and a thirst for vengance that curdles within his soul. There are several extraordinary twists with pretty boy Enrique Iglesias and nonchalant Johnny Depp, but this is definitely a great action/drama film. Once you watch it, you'll want to buy it.

A little more acting this time with some great parts played by Johnny Depp, Salma Hayek, Mickey Rourke, and Willem Defoe. As always it is filled with plenty of action, and testosterone. This is one I plan to add to my set. The other two aren't complete without it. A nice trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Once Upon a Time in Mexico" works as both a fable and a dark comedy. Anyone hoping for a dose of reality or a great drama will be disappointed. Director Robert Rodriguez admittedly was having a great time playing with his digital cameras and other gadgets while making the movie. The cast of excellent actors was also having fun, and none of them took the project seriously. Although the film is rather violent in a cartoonish sort of way, it's often very entertaining. It is what it is - nothing less, nothing more. <p>The movie is the third of Rodriguez's movies about the exploits of El Mariachi [Antonio Banderas], a wandering Mexican musician whose true avocation is fighting injustice and corruption. In this episode he uncovers a plot to kill a Central American president in order to install a military government that is friendly to a powerful drug cartel. One of the plan's leaders is the general who killed El Mariachi's wife [Selma Hayek] and daughter in the second movie, "Desperado". Another powerful adversary is Sands [Johnny Deep], a psychotic CIA agent who tries to use El Mariachi for his own devious purposes.  <p>Not a great movie, "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" is a fun movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This film is good, not great. Get me wrong I DID like this film but's just not as good as El Maricahi or Desparado. Johnny Depp is definatly the best thing about this one!!!Antonio Banderas is also good in his reprising role. It's got a great supportin  cast(Including Cheech Marin,Mickey Rourke,and Willen Dafoe),but what really disappointed me was that Selma Hayek was in it very too briefly!!! But it's got oodles of action!!! It reminds me a lot the Godfather Trilogy were 1 and 2 are masterpieces and 3 is not!!! It just seemed totally different than the other two!!!But overall an O.K. movie!!! 3 stars for this one!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I think Once Upon a Time in Mexico surprisingly blows away Desperado. It's full of clever stunts and action, interesting characters and a great cast. Johny Depp especially steals the show once again like he did in Pirates of the Carribean. He loves playing strange and un-usual characters and he does it well.  It's hard to tell if he is good or bad but you still root for him. The guy is simply one of the best actors around and could make any movie worth watching. His character has more screen time than El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) but who am I to complain about that because he's great in this movie. <p>  I actually expected the movie to be an action/romance movie from the trailers. When you watch it you see that the plot is  just about revenge like Desperado's was. That's ok with me though because the action and Depp's performance just carry you away and you don't care what the plot is. Salma Hayak doesn't get as much screen time as you would think from seeing the previews. She shouldn't of had second billing actually. The movie is full of so many characters that even Antonio Banderas's  El Mariachi seems like just a side character. All the characters and actors that play them are so good though that I didn't care though. I mean you have Johny Depp, William Dafoe (Spiderman), Mickey Rourke,and Ruben Blades and they're all good. The movie is just a total good time. It's supposed to be the last one but it's so damn good that I wouldn't mind a part 4.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>*El Mariachi (4 stars out of 5)<br />For a very low-budget film, this is very well-made.  Even though it has very grainy picture quality, the filming style is very excellent.  It is a simple but great story filled with great action scenes and great characters.  It is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles, and includes a commentary track, a short film, and a making-of featurette.<br /><br />*Desperado (4 stars out of 5)<br />With a higher budget, this film surpasses its predessor both in quality and in style.  It has excellent image and sound quality.  There are loads of slick action scenes.  The story is not bad, and has some excellent characters.  It is well-written.  Music was good.  It is mostly in English with subtitles for Spanish-speaking parts, and includes a commentary, a making-of featurette, and I believe it has a free demo for video-editing software.<br /><br />*Once Upon a Time in Mexico (4 stars out of 5)<br />This last film has some of the biggest and best action scenes of the trilogy.  It still has great video/sound quality, a good filming style, good writing, good characters, and good music.  The only thing that really suffers is the story, which is convoluted and seems to have too many characters to keep track of.  Again, it is mostly English with subtitled Spanish-speaking parts.  It includes a bunch of featurettes, a commentary, and some deleted scenes.<br /><br />All of these films are exciting, entertaining, and very well-made.  All discs are special editions, and contain a wealth of extras.  Only the first film seems to have poor image quality, since it is so grainy, but it also accentuates the grittiness of the film and can be considered a benefit.  The other two films have nearly perfect quality.  Overall, this is a great set and is well worth the price.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>In Once Upon a Time in Mexico, writer/director Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Spy Kids, From Dusk Til Dawn) revisits characters he created and introduced with the low budget, but highly enjoyable, 1992 release of El Mariachi and followed up on in 1995's Desperado. <p>Antonio Banderas returns as El Mariachi, reprising his the role from Desperado that made him a name in Hollywood.  Also included is Selma Hayak as Carolina, Johnny Depp as the corrupt CIA operative Agent Sands, Willem Dafoe as a cartel drug kingpin Barillo, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes, Enrique Egelsias, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, and character actor Danny Trejo.<p>The plot, as I understood it, involved a complicated scheme to overthrow the president of Mexico, and who would end up assuming power in the vacuum that follows.  Agent Sands was particularly involved in this, seeming to work both ends for his own profit.  El Mariachi is recruited by Sands to eliminate the general hired by the leader of the drug cartel to assassinate the president.  The reason Sands contacted El Mariachi for this is due to a past, unresolved conflict between El Mariachi and the general.  Sounds complicated?  At some point, you may have to just go along with the movie, accept all the little subplots, and enjoy the ride.  And a fun ride at that.<p>The action is wonderful in this movie but scenes choreographed and shot beautifully, with associated scenery adding real texture and depth to the proceedings.  The characters, especially Agent Sands (Johnny Depp) are fun to watch, and the bullets do fly.  Explosions, bodies flying, action flowing in and out...there are few dull moments in this film.<p>The main problem I had with the movie is the plot just got too convoluted.  With the number of characters running around, the character of El Mariachi seemed be relegated to a secondary plot thread at times.  Maybe this was the intention, but having seen the two previous movies in this series, I think he should have had more screen time.  And some of the scenes cut out but put into the deleted scenes section would have helped in some cases to keep the flow of the film moving.  There was one scene, where Agent Sands is wearing a really bad fake moustache, and then the following scene he doesn't have it on...a deleted scene shows what happened to it, but had it been left in the movie, it wouldn't have created this minor gap that only served to bring me out of the movie.  One minute moustache, the next, no moustache...not a big deal, really, but this happened a couple of other times.  Also this movie seemed to lack the chemistry created in Desperado between Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayak.  You'll understand more if you watch the movie, as I don't want to give away too much, but their relationship seemed glossed over, probably due to the inclusion of other elements.<p>The movie looks wonderful, and there are scads of extras in this movie, and they are listed on the product page, so I won't get into them.  All in all, a fun, flamboyant, action filled movie with beautiful scenery that got tripped up a little on its' various subplots, losing the viewer in the process at times.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>I'm not usually a big fan of action movies, especially the typical ones centered around a male superhero out to save the world and bag the hot babe at the end.<p>But like &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;El Mariachi,&quot; Robert Rodriguez's &quot;Once Upon A Time In America&quot; has all the bang-bang-bang fun without the usual brain-dead male cliches and kindergarten-level myth-making.  His protagonist is one bad dude all right but it's all done in a very light-hearted, cartoonish spirit refreshingly devoid of ludicrous moral pretension or pompous overbearing machismo.  <p>Sure, this film has a more convoluted plot with some populist/democratic/nationalistic subtexts if you care to look for them, but why bother when you have all the Rodriguez trademarks there in full force: black absurdist and surrealist humor, gleefully unbelievable shootouts and acrobatic stunts, wry self-parody, ten-kiloton KNOCKOUT BABES (Eva Mendes and Salma Hayek).  <p>It's not as tight as &quot;El Mariachi&quot; (amazing how tight a $7000 budget makes you) or &quot;Desperado&quot; but compared to the usual crop of Hollywood blockbusters, is an effortless standout.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Maybe you read here or somewhere else that &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; featurs Antonio Banderas as its star.  No, wrong.  It's real star is Johnny Depp, who steals the show in every scene he is in.  In fact, you really wish that director Robert Rodriguez chopped the overlong film again, collected the Depp parts  only, and re-edited it to make it far better than now.<p>The convoluting story defies our summery, so let it be short.  Antonio Banderas character is recruited by force to help the assasination of the Mexican president.  The mastermind of the plan is General Marquez, but the trouble is, a CIA guy (cool and ruthless Depp) is also behind it, having its own plan to accomplish.<p>I know screenplay writing is not what made the name of Robert Rodriguez.  Still, the last of trilogy beginning from &quot;El Mariachi&quot; is getting more and more sprawling, damaging the imapct of the entire film.  I like his gadgets; I like his style of gun-shooting; but this time he overeaches himself, intent on violence done without his grace.<p>But the most unforgivable thing is the way of using Salma Hayek.  You see her name on the second place of the credit.  But the time allotted to her is so short that her appearance is slightly better than cameo (and see the poster if you have a chance, which suggests her role is more substantial than it really is).  This is simply outrageous, and surely invites the criticism of being dishonest.<p>The cast is quite unique, making a list of character actors -- Willem Defoe, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, and even Mickey Rourke -- but the confusing story kills any opportunities for them to impress us.  And Banderas is not particularly good, looking as if he does not know what he really wants to do.<p>See this one as another showcase for Johnny Depp's talent.  Only his role is interesting, and the final chapter is virtually made for him, in which he has to fight under the most disadvantageous condition (see for yourself).  In that moment only, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; regains the thrilling moments as we once witnessed in &quot;El Mariachi.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Antonio Banderas returns to the role that made him a star in DESPERADO, which also made Robert Rodriguez a household name and a star out of Salma Hayek. And this time, it plays out in epic fashion, like the final chapter in Sergio Leone's "Man With No Name" trilogy, "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly." Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Eva Mendes, Danny Trejo, Mickey Rourke, Enrique Iglesias and Cheech Marin also star. A fitting conclusion to the story continued in DESPERADO (I've not seen EL MARIACH, so I can't comment on it). Star power, a smartly written story and explosive action combine to make an action-packed good time. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>Anthony Bandaras and Johnny Depp are excellent in this film as, respectively, a legendary gunman who plays music and a rogue CIA agent who meets people with a fake arm so that he can hold a hidden gun with his true hand. Depp wants Bandaras to kill a man who is planning to assassinate a Mexican president. Bandaras accepts the job because he wants revenge. We are not told during the first half of the film why. We are also kept in dark for a long while why Bandaras gave up being a gunman and what he was doing since he abandoned this profession. The movie is filled with action, most of it appears impossible, which makes it more dramatic, and with strange characters, which adds humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>This movie loses a little steam near the end, but I have nothing but good things to say about this over the top, ultraviolent, pulp western...Say what you will about Banderas, but he was born to play this part. Plus we get to see Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino(his joke is hilarious...), and Salma Hayek in early or first film roles; Rodriguez is a master film technician in every way, and this movie is filled with innovative firefights and camerawork, all furiously put together with his usual trademark editing. The story is pretty bare bones, but it's the creative energy and on-the-mark performances that make this one of my top 10 favorites. Best bar shoot-out ever!! Sure, it's B-grade stuff...but classic nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Sinking us back into the gritty life of a tormented guitar player, Rodriguez sets the stage for an amazing film.  This time, Antonio Banderas steps into the role of the troubled Mariachi as he continues his quest to rid Mexico of the corrupted drug lord that destroyed his life.  Using friends like Steve Buscemi, he finds the town that is harboring his villain named Bucho.  The Mariachi's form of questioning normally leads to several dead, a cinematic gun fight, and some classic Sergio Leone verbiage.  Unfortunately, our hero does not escape unscathed and finds himself being healed by the likes of Carolina, a bookstore beauty played by Selma Hayek.  Together they build a steamy relationship that will help our Mariachi reach his final destination.  As more gunfights, explosions, and blood rock this independent blockbuster, we soon discover a hidden secret about our hero, one that could change the course of his destination.<br /><br />This was an impressive second outing by director Robert Rodriguez.  While I was worried that Hollywood would have drained too much of his imagination, it was instead the direct opposite.  Hollywood gave him the tools to build an amazing "sequel".  While different, yet the similar to his independent feature "El Mariachi", Rodriguez sets the stage for a roller coaster film that makes you hold your breath and pray for more.  He has taken elements from his first film and expanded them to new levels.  Banderas is perfect as our "new" Mariachi and the chemistry between him and Selma Hayek cannot be contested.  Banderas' ability to control this enraged man was spectacular.  They worked as our two main focuses of this film.  Coupled with some humorous moments with Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino, this film successfully stood on its own two feet thanks not just to the action, but the actors in their respective roles.<br /><br />Finally, Rodriguez is a genius behind the camera.  He is able to give us exactly the right amount of action, drama, and comedy for our liking.  He is the proverbial salad bar of cinema.  While giving us this deeply rooted character hell-bent on destroying this drug lord, he also lets our imaginations wander with his comical and cartoonish action sequences.  The scenes of men flying through the air after being shot are somewhat comical, yet completely Rodriguez.  He has successfully created this world that is all uniquely his own.  Rodriguez has done this by giving the world depth and outside characters. He builds suspense and also suspicion all at the same time.<br /><br />Overall, an amazing film (in case you haven't noticed) that should be found in nearly everyone's film collection.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Antonio Banderas sizzles as the vengeful Mariachi, and Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin, as El Mariachi's best friend and the bartender, do a splendid job in roles that were unfortunately overlooked by the critics. A great followup to El Mariachi. It's violent and bloody, but hey, these bad guys deserve it. Salma Hayak is alluring as the Mariachi's love interest, and the one-liners are great.

It sure appears that way with Kevin Costner's Open Range rounding up nearly $50 million in tickets sales and now Robert Rodriguez returns to Mexico in the series that made him famous. Once Upon a Time in Mexico is technically the third film in what has been dubbed the El Mariachi series. Why technically? El Mariachi was the original student film made by Robert Rodriguez for only $7,000. When Sony picked up the rights to it and commissioned the new director to remake the film, Desperado ended up being more of a sequel then a remake. Rodriguez left the adult realm of filmmaking temporarily with much success helming the fruitful Spy Kids series. With Spy Kids 3-D Game Over grossing over $100 million at the box office a little over a month ago, the cult director hopes to double his success by finishing off the cult favorite series that started his career. But the question is whether he can transition back from the family genre to the more mature action fare? Judging by the trailers and television ads, he seems to have no problems but looks can often be deceiving.<p>The story of Once Upon a Time in Mexico once again follows the adventures of the guitar wielding El Mariachi as he seeks retribution and revenge. El Mariachi has become a huge legend in Mexico but there is more truth behind the stories then most would expect. So true are these stories of mass killings by the guitar playing assassin that many of the cartels in Mexico have placed a huge price on his head and forced El to retire in isolation. But the price on his head is not the reason for his retirement rather it is the death of his wife and daughter at the hands of his archenemy that has brought about server depression. When a corrupt CIA agent named Sands drives him from his small village, El is recruited to take out an evil cartel called Barillo, who plans to take control of Mexico after he assassinates the president. Why is The Mariachi so willing to step forward to help him? The general who is leading the charge for Barillo killed his wife and children. Mariachi is back and is seeking blood and revenge for payback. The story for Once Upon a Time in Mexico is pretty decent but the pacing is not very consistent. The feature starts off very decently and the action sequences are well choreographed but for a longer then necessary period of time in the middle Mexico feels dragged on and lacks the punch the action fare delivers.<p>The cast for the third film in the El Mariachi series is a mixed bag delivering both the good and the bad. Starting off with the good and possibly the best would be Johnny Depp who gives another fabulous performance following his exuberant role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the summer hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Taking on the role of the corrupt CIA agent Sands, Johnny Depp shows he can deliver charming dark humor along with a wonderful action performance which proves he can strike lightening twice in a few months. Antonio Banderas is excellent as El Mariachi once again and quite possibly better then he was in Desperado. The close friendship between Banderas and Rodriguez shows that the actor really knows what the director wants in a lead performance and doesn't think twice about doing certain things within the feature. Salma Hayek, as beautiful and gifted as this actress is, was over hyped in promotion for this film. Without giving too much away about her character, she isn't featured that much in the film and when she is it is in flashbacks and those scenes don't have her speaking much. The decent thing to do would have had her have more important lines if not then why not just use clips of her from Desperado instead of having her featured so minimally? Willem Dafoe was pretty good as the evil cartel Barillo but it was very hard seeing him as a Mexican considering that he isn't. Not to say he isn't a good actor but there wasn't as wonderful as decent a Latino actor available?<p>Overall, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is an explosive and well choreographed gun assault that only falters to reload every once in awhile. Robert Rodriguez has to be greatly respected for the work he does especially when he tries so hard to keep the budgets down for his films but does the budget cutting hurt the overall effect? The cinematography is astounding except for several scenes including a scene where Johnny Depp's character shoots a man in the head in a restaurant. Those scenes looked like they were filmed on a handheld camcorder and felt insulting to the audience that paid decent money for the feature. And there was a lot more blood, gore and unnecessary violence then most people can tolerate in a normal action film but doesn't beat out Bad Boys II for the "Action Gore Award" this year though. Despite some picking at the campy directing style of Robert Rodriguez and the overloaded action sequences, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a decent action effort that kicks Dickie Robert's butt across several movie theaters and beyond. If more films follow in Mexico's footsteps then the Fall 2003 efforts will keep the movie-going public well entertained till The Matrix Revolutions arrives in November.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was hilarious...whether it was supposed to be or not.

As only an action movie, It wasn't that bad but...<br /><br />1. They've shown mexico as an extremely primitive country, just like one of central or south american tiny republics. everyone knows Mexico although is not a modern country, but it's not that primitive too. they always show Desolated primitive northern states as entire mexico. it's an insult to mexican people! Is U.s. Arizona, New Mexico or parts of Texas better than mexican northern provinces? I guess not! Mexico City is a city with more than 10 million population! and It's a modern city! It's not right to show our neighbours primitive on purpose!<br /><br />2. What's this Mariachi? Superman? Spiderman? Batman? I guess he soppose to be more real than a comic hero. most of his efforts could be end up unright! a person can be lucky and survive one time, possitively, two times! but not each time. I don't know why can't they just get rid of that "Comicism (I made this term myself!)" in their mind and create a realistic hero that children and youth can try to be like him with some effort and doing some sports! the mariachi I saw here, was a Superhuman!<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good action movie for one night. at least it makes you less nervous than some similar movies! it has a good and reasonable story, great visuals and great actings. oh, buy the way, let's have a word about blind Jhonny Depp in this movie too! He sopposed to be blind. a Sudden Untrained blind. so how could he accomodate himself with new condition and became a "Laegendary like" warrior in less than an hour? and what was he looking at with no eyes? If he tried to act like a real blind man, it was a fair try!</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>after the hugely summer of 2003's Pirates Of The Caribbean, Johnny Depp (Secret Window, Finding Neverland) returns as a corrupt Agent named Sands who brings Antonio Banderas (Evita, The Body) gun toting El Mariachi out of hiding...soon Banderas is brought into a web of double and triple crosses involving something to do with overthrowning the president. Banderas spins, flings, soars, jumps, rolls and just does about every thing in this movie and Depp gives us another enjoyable and unforgettable character as he gets all the highlights in this movie. Depp doesnt do all the things Banderas does but he does lose his eyes towards the end. Also starring Willem Dafoe (upcoming XXX:State Of The Union, Shadow OF The Vampire), Eva Mendes (Hitch, Stuck on You), Mickey Rourke (Spun, Angel Heart), Danny Trejo (From Dusk Till Dawn, Anchorman), Cheech Marin (Tv's Nash Bridges, Christmas With The Kranks), Enrique Inglesias, Ruben Blades (Color Of Night, Devils Own) and Salma Hayek (Frida, Dogma). Hayek doesnt have a big part in this movie basically because she's just in flashbacks. Good action scenes makes this third installment of Robert Rodriquez's trilogy a grand ride even though its not as good as Desperado or El Mariachi...its still bloody good fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I find Rodriquez's DVD's additional features just as enjoyable to watch as the movie feature itself.  From the features, we can sense that the Director is young, dynamic, &amp; enormously talented; a Director that likes to get his hands dirty and be involved in ALL aspects of the production if he manages to find time to do so; a Director that is experimental and willing to embrace changes especially his fling with the digital high density technology that is used in Star Wars prequel; a Director that has a whimiscal sense of humour by introducing a cooking class and in the not long future, fornification class (believe it or not!); a shrewd Director who believes that a profitable and enjoyable movie can be made in the shortest of time by thinking outside the square and willingness to try something new; a Director who still works from his own house and away from Hollywood.  It's obvious he gets so much joy doing the movie &amp; his thoughts are simply rambled through the interview.  He told us the inspiration behind the movie, the connection between this movie &amp; Quentin Tarantino, how El Mariachi came about, &amp; it's also interesting to hear from the actors &amp; actresses of reasons why they would love to work with this new generation Director.  If you have watched Desperado before, you would know what to expect but it's the additional features in this DVD collection that packs a punch. Highly recommended!  Last note, it might be forgettable but Rodriguez reminds us all that movie making needn't be a chore!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Once Upon a Time in Mexico - the sequel to Desperado - is a tale of Antonio Banderas as a superheroic gunman battling outlaws in the modern west.  As indicated by the title, this is a bit of an homage to Sergio Leone's films, and this story does have a good, a bad and an ugly.  The good is Banderas's gunman, a vengeance-driven guitar player who is called on to forsake his vows of non-violence.  The bad is Willem Defoe's drug lord, who has financed a coup d'etat which will be led by a general who had also killed Banderas's wife and daughter.  The ugly - and easily the most entertaining character - is Johnny Depp's amusingly sociopathic CIA agent who will kill with little cause but also has his human side.<p>Although lightly entertaining, this is not a great movie.  There are far too many characters and the plot is needlessly complex.  Banderas is supposed to be the hero, but he isn't very interesting; he's just a shooting machine.  Since the deaths of his family have occurred before the start of the movie, they don't really have much emotional impact and therefore it is hard to empathize with his vengeance motive.  Depp, on the other hand, is interesting; with his strange craving for balance in the universe, he evens the odds in many situations, but his intricate manipulations eventually get too much even for him to handle.  Selma Hayek - despite her prominence in the ads - is actually only in the movie only briefly.<p>I can't exactly give this movie a rave review, but it is passably fun and won't be a waste of your time.  On the other hand, if you never see it, your life will not be incomplete.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>Review disclaimer:<br /><br />Please note: This movie was reviewed on my PSP, not the DVD.

Is it a Shakespearian masterpiece?  Of course not.  Is it a shoot-'em-up and go-for-broke adventure filled with power and entertainment?  Heck, yeah!  This is a film that proves to be a good time--especially for those who want a real action movie that has a unique touch to it.  While it may be over-the-top at times, it's a breath of fresh air for those who have been disappointed with some of the latest action blunders.<p>The film is Robert Rodriguez's final chapter in the &quot;El Mariachi&quot; saga, completing the trilogy.  Antonio Banderas returns as the lone gunman who has a passion for guitars.  Unable to escape his horrific past, he gets an opportunity to get revenge against the person who has caused him so much dread.  The person who offers him the job is a crooked CIA agent--a man who does not hesitate to get his hands bloody in order to get what he wants.  A simple meeting between the two unleashes a complex and even sometimes downright confusing story with twists and turns around every corner.  You don't know who is playing who until the very end in this exciting thrill-ride that is both exhilarating and humorous.<p>I really enjoyed watching &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico.&quot;  I've been so disappointed with some of the most recent action flunkies that have been released in the past few months.  It's a highly entertaining movie that resembles a hi-tech western filled with top-notch action sequences that are absolutely exhilarating.  The movie is most certainly violent and gory, so it is not recommended for the squeamish.  However, I must point out that a good majority of the violent sequences are cartoonish and purposely over-the-top.  I also must point out that even though this is the end of a trilogy, it doesn't mean that the only way to enjoy this movie is if you have seen the other two movies, &quot;El Mariachi&quot; and &quot;Desperado.&quot;  I can say this with confidence, as I have yet to see those two movies (although I did see parts of &quot;Desperado&quot;).  This may not be the best one in the series, but I have a feeling it is the most entertaining.<p>The movie has an impressive roster when it comes to casting.  It's been awhile since I've seen so many big names in one movie.  You have Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, Mickey Rourke and William Dafoe.  And that's only naming a few.  Everybody is really great in their roles, although I have to confess that Johnny Depp is what really makes the movie.  He steals every single scene that he is in.  His character is a great creation and is a joy to watch.  The downside to the movie is that the story tries too hard to be too complex at times.  You really are confused through more than a good half of the movie when you first see it.  This is in no way a major flaw, but it is a flaw nonetheless.<p>The DVD has a ton of goodies to offer for you DVD fanatics.  The first thing that has to be brought up is the glorious picture quality!  The film was shot in High Definition--and it really shows.  It's crystal clear and beautiful.  The picture looks ten times better than it would have if it were shot on plain film.  The sound is pretty decent, although I think they could've stepped it up a notch.  Extras included are deleted scenes, featurettes, commentary, trailers and more.  The featurettes are really interesting to watch.  A great suggestion is to watch them after you've seen the film, and then watch the movie again right after you do that.  Chances are that your appreciation for the movie will grow.  I know it did for me.  A very impressive DVD package, I must say.<p>&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; is a great time if you're looking for an exciting action-packed event.  It's not one to choose if you're looking for a movie with a deeper meaning to it all.  This is one to choose if you simply want to have a good time and want to be entertained.  This is certainly a film that I will be watching numerous times.  The end result is a thrilling joyride from Robert Rodriguez that stands out from most of the other action flicks.  Strap in and enjoy the ride. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Featuring one of those Jack Sparrow like performances by Johnny Depp that elevates a mediocre film into something worth recommending, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is not going to be accused of being a great film but it's fun and full of enough winning moments to make the film likable; I certainly don't think I came out of Robert Rodriguez's film having learned anything, but I had a pleasant 100 minutes and sometimes that's enough.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Ah the delectably curvy, sensuously capable Salma Hayek holds her own if not outright steals the show.  This and Fools Rush In are my favorites of hers.  She and Antonio definitely have a great chemistry onscreen in this Mexican shoot-out noir.  Antonio, previously a mariachi, is on a revenge kick to kill the drug lords responsible for the death of his beloved and the loss of his guitar playing hand. The action sequences are marvelous and hold up well to the matrix style enhanced effects that came about later in the 90's.  Salma plays a strong willed and capable Latina book store owner, who crosses paths with the Mariachi, with a quiet fortitude.  She falls a bit too quickly for the hero as all hell breaks loose with the final showdown between Antonio, his two buddies [wielding guitar cases that launch rockets and double as machine guns], and the final drug lord.  A dark and not so subtle humour pervades, especially with Cheech and Tarantino.  Overall an effective, amusing, enjoyable action flick with a bunch of great ensemble cast.

This contrived film consists of nothing more than a shallow plot to float the over-the-top action scenes that would make Rambo II look as sober as Platoon.<br /><br />  A very shallow plot inserted merely to support a sequence of overdone shootout scenes that are simply too ridiculous to be considered as anything else but bad slapstick. Suddenly our gunmen are like Spiderman and can jump along walls as if endowed with superhuman powers, they dodge bullets like Superman, etc. These ludicrous scenes are so comical that they immediately descend to a moronic level. Given the overwhelming stupidity of this film and his complete lack of understanding of firearms, Robert Rodriguez needs to go back to the basics of film making and consult with reality to give his audience an at least plausible, if not meaningful, story before releasing more of this infantile garbage.<br /><br />  This movie is a sorry joke on the audience and isn't worthy of even being rented. Watch 'Desperado' and 'El Mariachi' instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>I was too lazy to see ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO when it played the Big Screen. Ennui saved me a terrible waste of money.<p>El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) is recruited by CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) to foil the coup being plotted by drug cartel boss Barillo (Willem Dafoe) and corrupt General Marquez (Gerardo Vigil) against the Mexican El Presidente (Pedro Armendariz, Jr.). <p>Perhaps 5% of the dialogue is in Spanish, the rest English. If the subtitles on my copy of the DVD were &quot;turned on&quot;, English text translated the former and, most annoyingly, English text accompanied the latter. Well, duh!<p>The assassination of a Mexican President would seem to have all the dramatic story potential as a murder of the president of Iceland or Chad - perhaps less. It's no surprise, therefore, that this element of the storyline takes a distant back seat to the real conflict of the story, which is between El Mariachi and Marquez, who, at some point in the past, killed the former's wife (Salma Hayek) and daughter. El Mariachi is a tormented man out to get even.<p>This film is endlessly and casually violent, and the final body count must lie somewhere between the twentieth century battles of Verdun and Stalingrad.<p>The only compensation for sitting through this mess is the occasional appearance of the gorgeous Selma Hayek, and the quirky persona given the Sands character by Depp. Among other things, Sands orders carnitas wherever he goes. At one point, after eating a version of the dish so much superior to all others he's tasted to date, he casually kills the chef so, as he puts it, &quot;balance is restored&quot;. <p>To be fair, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO is a sequel to EL MARIACHI  (1992) and DESPERADO (1995). Perhaps I would better understand this last in the series if were to see the first two.

Although Johnny is not always up to par, Sweeney Todd seemed, well, too bizarre even for him, he is not afraid to take on quirky roles in the interest of making some memorable characters. Here he plays an upfront (literally) CIA agent down in Mexico to help defuse what looks like an attempt by the bad guys to knock off what passes for a good guy el presidente there and take over the government. To do, whatever. Yes, I know the plot sounds very familiar. Also familiar in this third part of the trilogy is the Angel-Diablo avenger of the people's wrongs, and his own personal wrongs (wife, played by Salma Hayek, in flash-backs killed by the bad guys), Antonio Banderas. Of course that means plenty of shoot `em up, bang `em up as the two sides fire every thing they have at each other. And equally true, of course, the bad guys get their just desserts. Johnny will get a citation from the bosses at Langley for this one for sure.<br /><br />P.S. Here is one thing that has always intrigued about shoot 'em up movies and it was really obvious here. Now I am no expert of weaponry, although I know how to handle a gun but Antonio Banderas' shooting from every hip at random would seem to be foolhardy. Not only that but his chances of hitting anybody in the real world that way would seem minimal. On the other hand even the elite forces of the opponent seem, always, to be something out of the gang that could not shoot straight. The good guys must have the angels on their side, right?</p></br><a href="../users/A1X7FS1H4R02W1.html">A1X7FS1H4R02W1</a><br/><p>He and his brothers carry guitars, to hide there guns.

Still, one can't deny that "Desperado" is still pretty watchable.  There's good action, some funny moments (mostly courtesy of Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino), and the undeniable beauty of Salma Hayek.  The thing goes on a little too long, however, for a movie that basically just wants to entertain you with a succession of cleverly conceived and shot action sequences.  Kudos to the DVD image, though: it's blisteringly sharp and clear.  The extras are good, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO is a hoot! Despite the fact that there is an incredible amount of violence, blood, explosions, and other forms of daring-do, Robert Rodriguez has such a good time galloping along on this adventure that it is difficult not to enjoy the ride. The sets and special effects are a terrific background for this hero adventure of El Mariachi, played to sheer perfection by Antonio Banderas.  His sidekicks  are the underused Marco Leonardi and Enrique Iglesias, the female pulcritude is handled with panache by Salma Hayek and Eva Mendes, and once again stealing every scene in which he appears the multitalented Johnny Depp proves that he is one of the finest sophisticated comic actors on the screen today.  All of the cast members (including Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Willem Defoe, Mickey Rourke, etc) offer excellent cameos.  Everything about this &quot;Mexican style&quot; 'Italian Western' of Sergio Leone's style works. Yes, everything is in excess, but that is the joy of the spoof of it all.  Sit back and just enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Three  years after Robert Rodriguez came along and showed the world how a mere $7,000 and a lot of creativity could make a successful film called El Mariachi, he made Desperado.  This 1995 film has a bigger budget and more star quality, but the imprint of this director is certainly there.  There's lots of violence - with guns, knives and explosives.  And, like El Mariachi, the characterizations are secondary to the constant action.  It's all very silly, and a little too long at 106 minutes, but I frankly couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  <p> <p>The film stars Antonio Bandaras as the good guy and Salma Hayek as his romantic interest.  There's a cameo performance by Quentin Tarantino and Steve Buscemi has one of the best scenes in the film as he sets up the story at the beginning by his tall tale in a bar.  <p> <p>This is not a film to be taken seriously.  It's targeted to teenage boys and the video game crowd.<p> <p>So why am I watching this flick and enjoying myself so much?  I guess it's cause I'm just a film buff and am fascinated by the techniques and constant action.  And best of all I loved the extra feature, which shows how one of the scenes was filmed.  It's not for everyone, of course.  But I liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>A sequel/remake of the indie classic El Mariachi, Robert Rodriguez remade his indie classic with a much bigger Hollywood budget, and a bankable then rising star in Antonio Banderas.  Banderas plays the Mariachi; a revenge driven guitarist carrying a guitar case loaded with guns and weapons.  On his mission to find the man behind the death of his lover, he runs across a beautiful book keeper (Salma Hayek in the role that got her well known) and plenty of action that results in quite a balet of blood, bullets, and explosions.  The action scenes are over the top and they manage to reach the point of absurdity at some points, but for some reason it all manages to click, and Desperado ends up being one of the best action films of the 90's, and it made Banderas and Hayek stars and further more announced Rodriguez's directorial talent to the world.  The film includes a great cast which includes Steve Buscemi, along with Rodriguez regular Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin, and a humerous extended cameo from Quentin Tarantino.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>this was perfect a differnet volume for the collection loved the shoot out scenes loved eva mendes and hayak,, jonney depp was great only thought it could have been a lil more fast paced-- one for the collection</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>How does this movie differ at all from &quot;Desperado&quot; (in 1995) besides adding Johnny Depp?

Although the director is the same, there is definitely a revamp in the film.  For example, Antonio Banderas replaced the original actor of The Mariachi to play the character in Desperado.  This gives you a sense of what one can do with more money and a bit more time.<br /><br /> However, I have not given you a sense of the story.  The story is set a few years after The Mariachi ended, with Steve Buscemi's character telling tales of this gun slinging Mariachi.  Apparently, Antonio Bandera's character, the Mariachi, has put up his guitar for his new lifestyle of revenge killings.  With his final revenge nearing, Banderas has many difficulties as his progress is halted many times.  Only when another lady comes into his life, played by Salma Hayek, does Bandera get back on his mission.<br /><br /> This movie was good, and entertaining.  I do not feel that the acting was necessarily exemplary, although I did like Buscemi playing the role that he did, because it just seemed to fit him so well.  The gun battles were neat, and the cinematography over all was nice.  What really made this movie for me was the connection with The Mariachi, because it was not unlike, for good reason, Tarantino's style of tie-ins to previous movies.  This movie would get a 3.5 for its revitalization of the modern Western, with a distinctly Southwest/Mexican feel.  However, I can only give it a three or four, and I round down, so three it is.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Antonio Bandares, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, great actors right.  I am not going to say bad things about them, but who ever wrote what could've been the corniest script since Gigli. &quot;Are you a MexiCAN or a MexiCAN't&quot;  After an hour of torment I could'nt take it.  I swear, I think Fidel Castro even hates this movie.  The action was so often it got boring.  The plot was very very unintriguing.  Definately a don't see film.</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>It's hard not to see this as a let down following Desperado and given the additions of some big names, most notably Johnny Depp. However, judged as simply another high action low everything else movie, it isn't that bad. There's lots of explosions, shoot-em up scenes, and some over-the-top squeamishness, but there is enough left-over cool factor from the previous two to make it enjoyable enough. Depp steals the show and in hindsight, I wonder if this was a vehicle made more for him than Banderas, Hayek, or anyone else. His character is compelling to watch as he quirks his way through the convoluted plot and brings a bludgeoningly sardonic element to the otherwise largely two dimensional characters. Hayek is barely present, Mickey Rourke is bland, and Willem Dafoe was simply a bad choice. He does an almost black-face as a Mexican, the make-up so horridly obvious on his fair features. I find it impossible to believe that there were no Latino actors who could've brought equal marquee stature and shored up the woeful lack of credibility brought by Dafoe. Still, Eva Mendes is a nice evil touch and the heart of the movie may just belong to Ruben Blades as the retired FBI agent out to do the right thing.<br />Once again, as in Desperado, there is a boy who plays a small but important role in the movie and adds some humanity to the popcorn carnage.<br />Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a fair part of the trilogy and while it pales in comparison to it's predecessors, standing on its own, it is adequate enough for a good viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' continues the story of El Mariachi, played by Antonio Banderas.  After the events of 'Desperado,' El Mariachi attempted to settle down with Carolina, played by Selma Hayek, but a ruthless Mexican general had other plans.  Having lost the love his life, El Mariachi retires to a mission where guitars are made until the henchmen of rogue CIA agent Sands, played by Johnny Depp come calling...<br /><br />This is one confusing tale.  There are multiple parties pulling the strings.  Agent Sands is encouraging a Mexican revolution, but he wants the leader in charge killed after the revolution is over.  The head of a Mexican Drug cartel, played by Wilem Dafoe, is funding the revolution, and trying to make himself disappear in the process.  The Mexican General is intent on sezing power in Mexico.  It takes careful attention to figure out how exactly the parties all fit together.<br /><br />Don't go looking for a lot of 'good guys' in this movie.  There are probably only two genuinely good guys:  El Mariachi and Jorge, a retired FBI agent.  Whether they are actually good guys is debatable.  Many of the characters evolve throughout the story, and a few even become likeable.<br /><br />If you are watching the movie to see Selma Hayek, don't bother.  Her role is minimal, and you find out that she is killed off before the events of the film even take place.  She frequently given second billing in this movie even though she has less screen time than a dozen other actors.  Still, she does have a memorable opening scene.<br /><br />Overall, I tempted to give this movie 3.5 stars.  However, I liked it more than three stars, and since 3.5 is not an option, I'll go with four.  I'd recommend it to anyone that liked 'Desperado,' but some of those fans are bound to be disappointed.  The movie is frequently confusing, often gory, and not for children.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Robert Rodriguez's &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; is the last of the &quot;El Mariachi&quot; trilogy that introduced the director to the cinematic zeitgeist, and he has stuffed it full of characters, subplots and faux Mexican patriotism in a grab for prestige. Too bad half the film is missing. An ardent supporter of the &quot;freedoms&quot; of digital filmmaking, Rodriguez had the material - and, presumably, the digital canvas - to produce a violent, angry epic, Sam Peckinpah style, as long and hard-boiled as you like it, if a little short of the Sergio Leone masterpiece to which the movie's title refers. Instead, &quot;Mexico,&quot; at less than two hours, equates to a series of glancing blows, and is generally an incoherent mess. <p>Antonio Banderas, guitar player/hitman of the previous film, &quot;Desperado,&quot; returns, essentially, to shoot guns for CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) who's looking to stir up trouble for the Mexican president. Sands plays twelve angles at once, pushing the buttons of the Mariachi, a foxy cop (Eva Mendes), a Mexican drug lord (Willem Dafoe), an ex-FBI agent (Ruben Blades) with a score to settle with the drug lord, and the drug lord's right-hand American creep (Mickey Rourke). And a general. And the president. And the president's advisor, a modern Brutus. And Enrique Iglesias. And on and on. <p>Depp is unquestionably the movie's star, and Rodriguez seems to have written more into Agent Sands then the rest of the movie combined: Is it necessary for Depp to offer a speech, however cute, on the type of shredded pork he prefers to eat in Mexico, then shoot the chef for making it too well, when a military coup is one of the movie's backdrops? The half-cocked, androgynous approach that clicked in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; falls flat here; to quote Sands Chuck Berris is a wee bit more believable spy. Banderas is a sweaty cipher, Dafoe is barely there. A bewildered Rourke can't seem believe he signed up to pet a little dog as his performance.  Blades puts a little meat on his role, but even he is a plot soldier, getting a paycheck, pulling his gun when required.  <p>In his apparent nirvana over a digital workshop in his garage, Rodriguez is getting sloppy. His movie is littered with violent showdowns that haven't bothered to build up a pretext for their existence. They erupt, splatter, sputter. His rapid-fire editing obliterates the continuity of every gunfight. There are inspired ideas - Agent Sands meets a particularly grotesque-yet-heroic end - but the heart of &quot;Desperado&quot; has been traded out for delusions of grandeur. Rodriguez has managed a trilogy, all right: &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; is an unsatisfactory western, action and noir film.<p>And now I mention Salma Hayek. It's important to understand Hayek headlined the advertising campaign for this movie, made the talk show/magazine rounds, had star billing above Depp, no less. In &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico,&quot; blink and you'll miss her. Think I'm kidding? Cheech has more screen time, and his character dies. For that matter, so does Carolina, Hayek's persona - before the events in the movie even occur. Most movie marketing is cynical. Few ploys are this cheap.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I used to watch this movie all the time in high school, and I happened to catch it on cable yesterday and watched it again. As a kid, you don't realize how unrealistic this movie is but as an adult I was calculating how many times Antonio Banderas' character should've been dead. In a bar fight full of men with loaded guns (#1), strolling down the street with his back turned and a bad guy following him (#2), sitting on a bed while Salma Hayek's character Carolina sang (#3), the gun fight in the middle of the street with the bulletproof limousins (#4) and definitely walking into the gate of Joaquim de Almeida's character Bucho (#5). The way these guys were killing everybody else, they shouldn't have even had time to look at anybody's face. But as with almost every action film, the movie wouldn't be any fun if the main character who is the heroine got shot in the first scene.<br /><br />I absolutely enjoyed just looking at Antonio Banderas. My gawd, he's gorgeous. But eye candy can't always carry a movie because I thought "Takers" was full of good-looking guys and hated that movie. I can go down the list of movies with incredibly handsome men who I had absolutely no desire to see in an action flick but then go into average-looking guys who kept me engaged through the whole film. The secret to making an action film work for someone who is not an action film fan is style. Banderas has style. It's not that he's killing people. It's that he's so smooth with it. Not many people can glare at their enemies, storm down the street with bullets flying and look GREAT doing it. Even the knife guy was fun to watch.<br /><br />I'm not into blood baths and watching guys mop blood from a floor, but this was a Quentin Tarantino film with him as one of the leads so "What are you gonna do?" I don't think I'd have given this movie another glance if not for the actors who were chosen for these roles. The cast directors knew what they were doing. And I'd watch this totally unrealistic 1995 movie for another 16 years, too!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Desperado is an ok movie, little overdone,excessive violence and near impossible things happening.

I'll just try to limit them to a few. The headline here states one of them. Others could be "ludicrous," "fun," "amusing," "stupid," etc. You get the idea.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez took the profits from his first film, "El Mariachi," and continued on with the story now with more funds, so he made it glossier, more explosive, added some name actors and, of course, way overdid it, making it almost a cartoon it is so outrageous. He continued this with the third film, "Once Upon A Time In Mexico" which is even more of the same.<br /><br />Whether the movie is really dumb or its just tongue-in-cheek humor by Rodriguez, it has super-style and fun to watch. Talk about stylish! No wonder Quentin Tarantino and he are good friends and the latter has a guest appearance in the film. They both love having fun with the cameras.<br /><br />The first eight minutes let you know what you are in for: outrageousness. It's an 8-minute scene at a bar involving a story told by Steve Buscemi. It's one of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek are the "good guys" but they aren't exactly Billy Graham and Mother Teresa. If they are the good guys, you can imagine how evil the "bad guys" are? Speaking of them, two of the toughest- looking hombres in the business are chief among the villains: Joaquim de Almeida and Danny Trejo.<br /><br />Some of the action scenes are so outrageous you laugh out loud. My favorite was a guy shooting rockets out of his guitar case! As that tells you, it's just a wild ride: 103 minutes of south-of-the-border Rodriguez-Tarantino lunacy and despite what may sound like a bunch of insults, I always have fun watching this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Very good video and sound quality.<br />*Includes a great deal of special features, such as commentaries, a bunch of featurettes, and trailers.<br />*Loads of great action scenes.

The only thing that really suffers is the story, which can be difficult to comprehend.

Antonio Banderas returns in the role that made him famous with Desperado, but his character and performance is outshined by the always fantastic Johnny Depp as the mysterious CIA Agent Sands who recruits the Mariachi for his own purposes.  Salma Hayek's role is nothing more than a cameo in the beginning flashback of the film, and the colorful cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Rueben Blades, Danny Trejo, and Eva Mendes; most of whom go greatly underused.  Once Upon a Time in Mexico is nowhere as great as either El Mariachi or Desperado, and the film would probably be a clunker were it not for Rodriguez' well crafted action scenes and Depp's film stealing performance.  All in all, this is worth checking out for fans of Depp or fans of the Mariachi, just don't expect much from it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>After watching Desperado, I was excited to see this movie coming out, especially knowing that Selma Hayek was in this one also.  Seeing Johnny Depp joining the film as an American agent promised a good film.  Unfortunately, I really don't feel the film quite coalesced into a coherent whole.<p>Parts of the movie are flashbacks, which prevent us from getting a solid flow. Although flashbacks often work, I never quite got the feeling that all the flashbacks helped us understand what was happening in the present day.  We are also introduced to characters, which have their pasts hinted at (like the former FBI agent or the other two members of the mariachi band), but we never get enough of the characters to feel that they fit.  They seem more like a quick plot device used to fill a gap.<p>The movie has Johnny Depp playing the role of an agent trying to stay in control of the situation.  His character is tough as well as funny.  Some of his lines will stay with you, as the director or writer seemed to make him a second focal point for the movie, which does not seem to have helped.<p>The movie also has Willem DaFoe, but I really don't feel that I saw his character much.  I have the feeling that maybe his big scenes had been cut from the movie.  He seems out of place.<p>If you are a die-hard fan of one of the actors in the film, then I would see it.  Otherwise, I would recommend giving this one a slip.</p></br></body></html>

When it came out it was pretty darn mind-blowing (despite the fact that behind the scenes Disney and Pixar were bickering to the point where Pixar would try to sever the relationship entirely but be unsuccessful at finding a new distributor).<br /><br />There has actually been a lot of evolution in the genre in the six years following the Incredibles' big screen debut but you really wouldn't notice due to the fact that Pixar was so far ahead of the curve back then.  About the only area that this film differs from most contemporary computer generated animated films is that a 155-minute runtime makes it potentially the lengthiest animated feature of them all.<br /><br />The story tells of one Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible), and his wife Helen (Elastigirl), a pair of the world's greatest crime-fighting superheroes.<br /><br />After facing a string of law suits for consequences brought about by their do-gooding, superhero activity becomes a criminal act in and of itself and fifteen years after their crime-fighting prime, Bob finds himself sharing a modest home with his wife Helen, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack. He works as an insurance-claims adjuster, and he's fed up with his pushy boss and fairly immoral business policies.<br /><br />Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment. What follows is a wild discovery for the former super human that it will take the combined efforts of a super family to save the world from total destruction.<br /><br />While often regarded as a superhero spoof film, the truth of the matter is that The Incredibles is really not too far off the mark in being simply a non-comic affiliated superhero action film.  Sure there's the family slant that's played on a bit more than what's common in most comic hero tales and there's visual clues that make it pretty difficult to pin down an exact time frame that the story is supposed to be taking place but realistically speaking, this is easily on par with some of the live-action efforts of Marvel and DC in recent years.<br /><br />In the opinion of many, The Incredibles marks Pixar and Disney's perilous leap toward big kid entertainment what with a PG-rated and plenty of guns, explosions, and action-driven sequences.  The change is typically credited to outsider Brad Bird (who also wrote and directed 1999's "The Iron Giant").<br /><br />For the most part the formula he brings to the table works with a pretty even balance of domestic drama to offset the crime fighting/ action scenes.  The husband and wife do their share of squabbling and even the kids get some screen time going at each other's throats. Dramatically speaking, it is a bit heavier handed than what's usually found in a comic book or for that matter, a Disney film but again since the story centers on the concept of former heroes being thrust into the domestic lifestyle, it's excusable as a necessity.<br /><br />A jazzy soundtrack coupled to super crisp visuals (especially in Hi-Def) makes the flow and tone of the tale extremely easy to fall into.  The nearly 2-hour runtime goes by quite quickly for adults and children alike.<br /><br />In all The Incredibles is a highly entertaining piece that still holds up well even half a dozen years after the fact.  It's a little heavier on drama/ lighter on laughs than I expected but the formula works (especially where a slightly more mature audience is concerned).</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>One thing I love about Pixar is the fact that they, lo and behold, do something different each time they make a movie.  Aside from the fact that Pixar adds as much for older people as it does for younger (as a matter of fact, I actually like Pixar more now than I did when I was younger), close inspection shows that they try new styles and new concepts each movie.  Pixar's The Incredibles is one of their most different, being a great action movie, an animation feast, a story that more often than not err, clicks with you, humor that's more than mere toilet humor, and another memorable cast of characters added to the already populated Pixar library of memorable characters.<br /><br />First off One of Pixar's benefits is using animation to create worlds unlike any other, and they did it so with The Incredibles despite the fact this movie could have been live action.  Besides, if they did it live action, this movie wouldn't look half as good as it does.  The animation is more simple compared to some of their other movies, but it's slick, sometimes simple comic book style (looks similar to Team Fortress, whatever style that's supposed to be) makes it's lounge-cool.  The use of Googie architecture is a big plus because I love that style, and slick effects and cool gadgets galore make their way into the world of the Incredibles.  Michael Giacchino's John Barry/caper-influenced score further adds to it's slickness.<br /><br />Incredibles once again gets some great voice talents (including Tarantino's most frequent collaborator.  Yes I had to say that), and the characters here are all glorious mash ups of different superheroes.  For example, Bob Parr is like a mix between The Thing and an actual person, and Elastigirl is another character that stretches like Plasticman.  Sure, none of them are that original, but there powers sure make for some sight gags, action sequences, and many situations that arise or feature the use of their natural powers (the bickering between the family during the dinner scene, for example).  All of these characters are likable, and while I don't feel they are as likable as some of Pixar's other movies (I wish there was a dog exactly like Dug), they still add for some very relatable situations.<br /><br />As for the villain himself Syndrome, I found him to be very interesting, reasonably ripped off at a young age but pitiful in his inability to forgive others to the point of extreme bitterness and plenty of sadistic tendencies.  He basically murders people by the thousands and the only way for him to get respect is to be a two-faced liar.  Even though he's loathsome, I think it's also a good cautionary tale for liking yourself and not idolizing others, because chances are the people who you idolize don't think of you as profound as you want them.  It's why I don't idolize anybody and am always my own main interest.<br /><br />It could be said that the superhero family is merely a gimmick for a movie that features satire that's painfully obvious.  But then again, it's enjoyable because it's straightforward satire, and nothing else.  No weird American Beauty-like symbolism and outlandish situations, just straightforward down to earth empty family life.  Kind of like Faces (John Cassavetes who most of you have probably never heard of) but the characters actually fix their family life and it ends on a much more positive note.  Those who complained about the ending being bright and cheery are stupid.  To me, that's called getting more out of life.<br /><br />I still don't exactly relate to everything here being that I'm not even in my 20's, but then again, thinking of what it's like to have a job you hate everyday and absolutely nothing different in your life is kind of depressing when you think about it.  What a hollow life.  It may not ring home with me as it does with the middle age people (Brad Bird himself based it off of his experience, so I don't think this movie was made to pander), but it's funny and understandable even to a person who doesn't have the full gist of what it's like to be middle age.<br /><br />But it's not an all serious all depressing movie by any stretch, The Incredibles is super fun and at times, super funny (no pun intended).  There are some very witty moments in here, the capes scene is classic, and I just love Edna Mode's gleeful passion of her costumes during the scene where she shows her new decided costumes, while Helen just stares with mixed feelings, having no idea how to react to something on display.  The concept of superheroes being sued is very clever, and this movie is, to sum it up short, fun.  Incredibles is great fun as an action movie, while not violent, but creative as well.<br /><br />For a PG movie, The Incredibles has some really entertaining action scenes, proving that you don't need gore and Bay style intensity to make a good action movie.  The Incredibles delivers great action sequences, creative and varied, even topped off with sound design that was rightfully awarded at The Academy Awards.  I'd even go this far and say if you put a gun to my head and asked me to pick either the Incredibles, Sin City, and 300 for action, I would easily pick the Incredibles.  I love both of those movies,  but the Incredibles really has some of the most entertaining, creative, and even easy to follow action sequences in recent memory.<br /><br />This is the last DVD of a Pixar movie that features loads and loads of delightfully entertaining special features that surely gets the most out of your DVD experience.  Then Cars was released and it all went to consumer hell, charging a whole extra DVD for _________ Spanish version alone.  Cheap ____________.  Never mind my rant.  Incredibles is not quite incredible, but it's still yet another winner from Pixar.  Cliched to say so?  Maybe.  However, one thing is for sure, Pixar keeps on showing that they know how to entertain audiences in the best ways possible for the best ways possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>Love animated movies. They're so great and fun to watch. It's like getting back to your childhood, except the technology wasn't as advanced those days, but anyways. The idea of superheroes fighting evil in an animated movies is great. The sounds, voices, everything about this movie is great. A superhero family trying to live "an ordinary" life is funny and also unpredictable. You can watch this movie with a boyfriend/girlfriend, little kids, friends,anyone. It's great.

Pixar beats Marvel comic's fantasic four too the summer movies.  The incredibles has alot of humour that adults will enjoy.<br /><br />Frozone really makes the movie fun, "Honey where is my super suit?" "I uh - put it away." "Why do you need to know?" "I need it!" "Nuh uh! Don't you think about leaving to do some derrin' do! We've been planning this dinner for two months!" "The public is in danger!" "My evening's in danger!" "Tell me where my super suit is WOMAN" "This is for the greater good!" "I am your wife! I am the greatest 'good' you are ever gonna get!"<br /><br />Kids love to quote Edna: "You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy, so ask me now before I become sane. " "No capes!" "Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!"<br /><br />In the first action scene, Mr Incredible stops his pursuit of a villian too assist an old woman rescue her kitten that is stuck in a tree by tearing up the tree and shaking it. Mr Incredible then uses the the tree too smash and stop the escaping villian's car.<br /><br />In another action scene, Mr Incredible stops a man from committing suicide. The man sues Mr Incredible saying "You never saved my life. YOU RUINED MY DEATH!!!" Mr Incredible and family are enrolled in the super hero relocation program and Mr Incredible must promise the government never to use his super powers, again.  Bob takes a job as an insurance claims agent.  Bob doesn't stay out of trouble for long and is forced back into super hero action.<br /><br />Helen, elastic girl is happy with her mundane life.

Dash desires involves school sports which is not a possiblity because of his super speed.<br /><br />Dash. "I promise I'll slow up! I'll only be the best by a tiny bit!"  Eventually, Dash will join the track team and place 2nd in the school race.<br /><br />Violet is becoming less noticed by the boys and particularly likes one boy but goes invisible to avoid talking with him.<br /><br />Voilet. "Normal? What do you know about 'normal'? What does anyone in this family know about 'normal'? We act normal Mom, I want to be normal! The only normal one is Jack-Jack - and he's not even toilet-trained! "  Eventually, Violent gains confidence and gets noticed by the boy.<br /><br />Bob, Mr Incredible remembers his glory days. Both,he and Frozone tell Helen they are going bowling but instead go out on secret missions patroling for villians and listening to police radios for activity.  After on nullified caper, Mr Incredible is contacted by a mystery woman with a secret assignment to get control of a rouge military robot, Omnidroid X.  Mr Incredible defeats the robot by tricking the robot into attacking itself.  The villian is a disgruntled fan, who seeks to punish Mr Incredible for his youthful rejection.<br /><br />The Incredibles get new suits and use their super powers very creatively and adaptively to defeat the super robot, avoid spinning razor hoover craft, hide from smart flying probes, and break out of electromagnetic containment cuffs.<br /><br />In the end the Villian is destroyed.  The villian is more irritating than diabolical and his cape gets the villian sucked into his aircraft turbines.

I finally got around to renting the movie. I have to say I absolutely loved the film.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" revolves around Bob and Helen Parr who back in the day were known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. Because of lawsuits, Mr.Incredible and Elastigirl are forced into retirement. They have three children Violet, Dash, and Jack. They live in a quaint suburban home. Over the years, Bob (or Mr. Incredible)becomes very restless and one night goes out to relieve his glory days as a superhero with his friend Frozone. What Bob doesn't know he is being watched by a mysterious stranger named Mirage who eventually recruits him to perform a secret mission (which leads to a series of secret missions).<br /><br />I have to admit I was a bit wary of this film. I thought Pixar couldn't outdo "Finding Nemo" (one of my top five favorite Pixar films) but the company did with "The Incredibles". The writing was excellent. I especially liked how they captured the teen angst that Violet was going through. What girl didn't go through that insecure stage that Violet experienced in the film? The animation was nothing short of amazing. Pixar continues to impress me with their use of computer graphics with every film they churn out.<br /><br />As far as animated films goes, Pixar has managed to outclass their rival Dreamworks with the excellent storywriting and impressive use of CGI. You truly do not need to be a child to enjoy films like "The Incredibles". Kudos for Brad Bird for making a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed the action&the visual effects a great deal within the context of this film. I'd put this film right almost there with "Shrek" because of the concepts. it's a good film&the directing was cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>The Incredibles" really is a great film for real children and those merely hiding in grownup bodies.  The combination of director Brad Bird and Pixar have created a fun excursion into the world of superheroes, complete with relevant modern-day tribulations thrown in for good measure.  Every time other film production companies feel like they are catching up to Pixar, the renowned CG animators make a great leap forward with something like "Incredibles", leaving the competition in the dust again.<br /><br />"Incredibles" is about superheroes who have lost their relevance in a world of lawsuits and spoiled wannabes.  Our heroes been forced into mundane lives of drudgery.  The two children have inferiority complexes because they cannot show their superpowers, and dad (Mr. Incredible) has to put up with a brainless, narrow minded boss at the insurance agency.  Mom (Elastigirl) spends her life ironing and dealing with dad's frustrations at not being able to assist the helpless!  Ah, but evil still lurks in the hearts of men!  A dastardly force is about to be unleashed from an uncharted island, and Mr. Incredible and his super family are their to save the world in the nick of time!<br /><br />The direct-to-digital transfer is a marvel to behold.  Even on my 10-year old Toshiba 36" CRT, the picture simply leaped off the screen.  It is clear to see just how far the CG animation envelope has been pushed beyond even the impressive work Pixar did in "Finding Nemo".  In point of fact, what really separates Pixar from the pack is the quality of the storytelling in their films.  One really cares about the characters and the journey they go through to reach the climactic battle with the giant robot at the end of the film.  There is real emotion here, things that anyone from 4 to 104 can relate to.<br /><br />5 big stars for Pixar hitting the nail on the head again with "The Incredibles"!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I won't go into reviewing the film itself.  Hasn't everyone seen it!!  It is terrific, deserved the Oscar and featured particularly high quality voice-work.  Craig T. Nelson was a blast, Samuel Jackson was clearly charged up, Holly Hunter shows her funny side, and creator Brad Bird is terrific as Edna.  The visuals are typically stunning, groundbreaking work from Pixar.  The glossy '50s era sensibilities mixed with modern is just perfect for computer generated films.  Pixar, better than anyone, seems to develop stories that just suit the form...remember how perfect TOY STORY seemed?!<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend the DVD highly not just because it's a movie kids and adults can enjoy time and again, but because it's got some terrific extras.  I haven't watched every single one yet, but just the few I've seen were worth numerous laughs.  The bonus short film, Jack-Jack Attack, while only 4.5 minutes long, is very frantic and funny...it reminded me of the Roger Rabbit "cartoons".  And BOUNDIN', the delightful short that played prior to the movie during its theatrical release is a joy, particularly for youngsters.  It's the kind of little film that just lifts your spirits right away...it's fluff of the best kind!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the fake cartoon.  The premise is that in the '60s, before the superheroes were banned by the government, there was going to be an animated TV show about the Incredibles, starring Mr. Incredible, Frozone and a very annoying rabbit named Skipperdoo.  The cartoon you can "enjoy" on its own...it's about 4 minutes long, and is just about the worst thing you could hope to see.  Almost no animation, with the "talking" provided by real lips moving behind the animated figure.  Kinda creepy, really cheesy!!  But endure the cartoon, because then you should watch it with the "commentary" provided by the "real" Frozone and Mr. Incredible.  It's pretty darn funny!!<br /><br />Other bits are fun too, and I'm sure the making of featurette will be of interest.  But you really should have this delightful movie and its delightful supplements in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>Right at the start I'll say it: I didn't see this at the theaters. All right? I was STUPID! After watching this film at home, I realize how idiotic I was. This film is yet another winner from Pixar. Those guys get better and better at their craft with each new film. The charactors are well-written, the personalities sharply drawn, the dialogue well done. The visuals, as usual for Pixar, are amazing. Perfect animation here, folks. The sound will blow you away, as the oscar for sound editing won will attest. The special features are great, my favorite being the new short feature 'Jack-Jack Attack". This short fills in the gap made by leaving the baby with a sitter while fighting evil. Hilarious! Actually, watch the short first then the movie, you'll crack up! Anyway, this film, while not quite as endearing as others in the Pixar canon, is very touching in a more adult way, and seems more geared for the adult audience. Score another solid success for the folks at Pixar!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>At a time where a lot of comic book movies are coming out based on actual comic books, in comes the Incredibles to show the other filmmakers how it's done. Constantine was really disappointing, Elektra was funny but not in a good way and Daredevil just didn't feel right. In comes Brad Bird, well known for the vastly underrated Iron Giant, he comes and completely thrills while still having it nice enough for the kiddies.<br /><br />Bob Parr was at the top of his game. He was formally known as Mr. Incredible whose special powers was incredible(ugh, I wanted to go through this review without using that word) strength. He also is married to Helen, or Elastigirl in the old days. However, in typical fashion, or probably in typical American fashion, Mr. Incredible is sued for people not wanting to be saved or from suffering injuries. So in the end, all the supers are sued and are forced into hiding, masquerading as regular people.<br /><br />Bob, 15 years since his glory days, is now a claims worker for an insurance company while Helen is a housewife. He finds life rather mundane since he can't relive his glory days. In comes Mirage, a woman who would like to hire him and do some superhero stuff. He agrees, not telling his wife and does some superhero work with his wife none the wiser. However, he's tricked by his employer and stranded on the employer's island. So Helen and their 2 kids, Dash and Violet have to go in and help Dad.<br /><br />One thing I like is that it is a kids movie with animation from a company that does kid movies but yet it's got more suspense and big action sequences then the last Spiderman. One scene, the "100 meter Dash" has Pixar calls it, is quite a scene to watch. Even the humor is there, while not being full of witty puns like previous films, it does have it's nice moments, like when Edna, a superhero costume maker regales Helen of the superheroes whose lives were cut short just because of a cape.<br /><br />The voices are quite nice. Craig T. Nelson("Coach")has a way to be a calm presense one scene than start going off. And Holly Hunter's probably the coolest mom on screen although her explanations of why Dash can't go into sports seems a bit TOO overprotective. And Jason Lee, largely known for his roles in the Jay and Silent Bob films actually does a good job as villain Syndrome. Definite highlight is writer/director Brad Bird doing a nice job as Edna Mode, a nice little Edith Mead echo, a big costume designer from the old era.<br /><br />There's one thing that I'm a little disappointed in and oddly it has nothing to do with the film. It's the extras. There's a cute little short that explains why the babysitter Kari was so frantic on the phone about baby Jack-Jack. It has really weak outtakes that just looks plain silly and nowhere near what they did for previous films. And the making of is nice but it's almost kind of superflous or surface skimming. They don't even go much into detail about the voice actors or the 100 meter dash in designing. But there is a nice feature on the Character Designs, the Extra characters, the Sets but they don't go into as much detail as you'd want them too like in the Bug's Life extras.<br /><br />However, it is quite a film to watch and not a typical "I'm only watching this for the kids" movie, you'll probably find it awesome too.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>The good sport--that's me, dragging my feet initially when my wife suggested seeing this movie, and I had something else in mind.  Finally I decided to be a good sport and you know something, sometimes karma wins.  For THE INCREDIBLES turned out to be one of the best movies of the year, and I wasn't alone in laughing, hollering, screaming, and hooting at the "incredible" action on the screen.  It's not only fun, it's smart as hell, and in our part of the theater there was not a kid to be seen so all you adults out there, you don't have to purloin a kid to come in and see the show, it's perfectly permissible to go just as you are, grown up and unencumbered.<br /><br />You might enjoy yourself even more than the kids, for the pic is slanted towards the adult viewer who might be a wee bit beyond the initial springtime of youth, and who might be regretting growing up and putting away the "things of the child," as the Bible says.  "Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too, darling?" sighs Edna Mode, the tiny, huge-spectacled couteriere as she saunters through her Julius Shulman mansion.  Right on, Edna!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Times change, and superheros begin to have lawsuits filed against them.  When the burden is too much for the government to bear, the Incredibles are forced into retirement and into normal life through the "Superhero Relocation Program".  But, working as an insurance salesman doesn't hold the same thrill for Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr (Nelson), and he finds himself listening to the police scanner with another former superhero by the name of Frozone (Jackson).  That way they can still offer their help to the police.  When a mysterious stranger enters his life, Mr. Incredible finds himself presented with an opportunity to regain some of his lost glory.  Now, he is working on the sly with his wife (Hunter) unaware of what is going on, but a secret like that cannot be kept forever.<br /><br />With "The Incredibles", Pixar goes the way of the big studios by making a superhero movie.  Despite some similarity to the Fantastic Four, this idea works pretty well.  It is fun to see the out of shape Mr. Incredible stuff himself into his costume and fight the bad guys.  The cartoon violence ups the rating to PG (a first for a Pixar movie), but there is nothing too over the top here.  "The Incredibles" is not as good as "Toy Story" 1 or 2 or "Finding Nemo", but kids and adults alike are sure to enjoy the majic that Pixar brings to the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Bob Parr is doing his best to live a normal life. He's got a wonderful wife, three beautiful kids, and a nice home in the suburbs.  But Bob hates his job as an insurance claims representative.  He sits in a tiny office (even more tiny for Bob because he's a big man and his office has this huge pillar going up one side) answering the phone, typing on a keyboard, and trying to actually help people who have problems. But, Bob's boss (a very tiny man) hates Bob because Bob agrees to almost every claim that is made.  Bob also has another problem.  Bob is actually a superhero:  Mr. Incredible.  He used to travel around the globe fighting off the forces of evil and standing up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. Then some guy who he saved from committing suicide decided to sue and all of America's superheroes had to go underground.  Things haven't been the same since.<br /><br />One day, Bob gets really mad at work and throws his boss through a wall. He's fired, but a mysterious stranger offers Bob to opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again and Bob jumps at the chance. At first things go fine. But then Mr. Incredible gets in over his head (you know, the whole "I work best alone philosophy" and "I can't let my wife know I got fired" attitude). Eventually his wife, who happens to be Elastigirl, and kids come to the rescue and it's up to the Incredible family to save the world.<br /><br />Simply put, THE INCREDIBLES are simply incredible.  Pixar has made a total of six full-length animated pictures and they've made a quality blockbuster with each one. THE INCREDIBLES is their latest achievement and is perhaps the best movie they've every made. The voice talents are once again perfectly cast with Craig T. Nelson voicing Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter voicing his wife Elastigirl and Samuel L. Jackson as Increcible's best friend, Lucius Best--better known as Frozone.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLES contains a great deal of action and some mild violence.  As Helen/Elastigirl tells her children before she sets off to rescue Dad, the bad guys here aren't like the bad guys on television, the bad guys here will kill kids if they get a chance. Like FINDING NEMO before it, THE INCREDIBLES is an amazing story of family love. It's also a reflection on temperance; finding the balance between what you were made to do and what everyone else in the world wants you to do.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLES was directed by Brad Bird.  Bird hasn't had an extended career in Hollywood and is best known for the animated film, THE IRON GIANT.  Some of the same ideas dealt with in that movie are also dealt with in THE INCREDIBLES, but in a totally different fashion with a totally different setting and cast of characters.  Bird also wrote the screenplay. In the movie there are clear influences from several great action films of the past, including STAR WARS. However, the item that THE INCREDIBLES resembles most is the graphic novel THE WATCHMEN by Alan Moore.  That novel revolutionized the comic book world and in many ways THE INCREDIBLES is a family, PG-rated version of that book.<br /><br />Prior to the start of the movie there is an animated short entitled BOUND. It's a story told in ballad about a proud sheep who is humbled after his first sheering, but is given a new look on life by a wise jackalope. Thank goodness there are jackalopes.<br /><br />Overall, THE INCREDIBLES is a great family movie and is one of the best movies of 2004. Watch it. Then go hug your kids or call your parents.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Ever wonder what happened to all of your favorite childhood super heroes?  Well, perhaps they have retired into normal lives with normal families.  Perhaps.<br /><br />Not long after Mr. Incredible marries Elastigirl, a mountain of lawsuits pile up against all the super heroes from the destruction they leave behind while saving the world and the people who inhabit it.  Forced into retirement, the Incredibles settle down to lead a normal life, working normal jobs and raising their children.<br /><br />Well, while their jobs may be normal, their children are not.  Violet has invisibility and force field capability, and Dash had super speed powers.  Only baby Jack-Jack appears to be without superpowers.<br /><br />Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) is extremely unhappy with his boring bank job, and often gets together with his best friend, Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone) to secretly fight crime.  When the beautiful Mirage spies on them and discovers their identity, she sends a proposal to Mr. Incredible that is too good for him to refuse.<br /><br />Bob hides his new "career" from his wife Helen (a.k.a. Elastigirl), though Helen notices Bob's happy new attitude and obvious weight loss.  Until the day she discovers Mr. Incredible's newly mended suit and her suspicions lead her to chase him down to a small volcanic island.<br /><br />It is here that things begin to go awry for the Incredibles, and when Helen discovers that Dash and Violet have stowed away on her plane as she flies off to confront her husband, the hilarious events become a family affair.<br /><br />The Incredibles is not just a kid's movie, it's great for the entire family.  I thought at first it would be too tame and too lame to watch, but I was delightfully surprised to discover how captivating and well done the movie is.  Don't be afraid to pick it up and watch it, the humor is sharp and witty and the plot is clever and absorbing.  Trust me, my kids are all grown and I bought this movie strictly for myself.<br /><br />Look for great performances from voice actors Samuel Jackson, Elizabeth Pena, Wallace Shawn, Craig T. Nelson, and Holly Hunter.  Highly entertaining with a hilarious ending, The Incredibles is a movie everyone can love.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  The best stuff on television and in film nowadays comes in animated form.  How is it that the writers, directors, and actors of live-action productions can't seem to generate much that isn't a half-hearted imitation of better productions from years ago while those in animation seem to keep getting better and better?  While it borrows heavily in atmosphere from James Bond and other 60s spy movies (as well as  "The Return of the Jedi" and other sci-fi action flicks), "The Incredibles" is a rollicking good time in its own right . . . and is a better James Bond movie than any produced in the past 20 years.  The idea of a family of superheroes isn't exactly new--and shows like "The Tick" have already lampooned the tribulations of superheroes in an everyday world--but "The Incredibles" pulsates with such energy and imagination that it's easy to overlook its faults.  Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are two actors I'd never have thought to pair up, but here they work amiably as a husband and wife team of semi-retired crimefighters struggling to raise a family while remaining incognito from a litigious world.  When a new archenemy arises (who looks like the love child of Heat Miser and John Lithgow), they are pressed back into action, this time with the help of their kids.  The computer animation in "The Incredibles" is solid, and the images and score manage to evoke Bonds like "You Only Live Twice" and "The Man with the Golden Gun," as well as productions like "Forbidden Planet," "Johnny Quest," and even the Walt Disney spaceflight shows.  True, there is some surprising violence, and this is another vehicle aimed at children that seems to want to teach them that only white people and the occasional black sidekick (here Samuel L. Jackson instead of Eddie Murphy or Chris Tucker) exist in the world, but it's a fun ride.  I do hope those responsible produce a sequel, if one with a bit more diversity.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>Since this is a Disney movie I skipped its theatrical run. I've seen most Pixar productions and they've all been fair, if not a bit too family-oriented for me. So after the gobs and gobs of good press (and it being directed by Iron Giant's Bird) I bought it on a whim. My reaction? AMAZING!! I LOVE the glorious art direction, the sheer DETAIL, the frenetic action sequences are dazzling and had me gasping for air, the casting (especially the always wonderful Holly Hunter), the inventiveness and creativity...it was TOTALLY thrilling. The feared "family" themes - what kept me away from the theater in the first place - were kept in check and not overdone. Not only that but Sam Jackson - once again - gives yet ANOTHER great performance. It's presented in 2.40:1 widescreen, which is a perfect choice. It is so cool to see animated features being given the "scope" treatment - I hope it's a trend that continues. This may be the best looking dvd I've ever seen. On my OLD Sony, it damn near passes for HD-quality, with some of the most stunning clarity and image detail I've ever seen. Particularly mind-blowing are all of the chase scenes, which were flat-out MESMERIZING. Needless to say, I WILL BE THERE when a sequel comes out!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Did you ever read comic books as a kid?  Did you ever wish you had super powers?  If you answered yes drop everything and go see this movie now.  I have been increasingly blown away by the quality filmmaking Pixar has brought to cinemas over the past decade, but The Incredibles marks the first time I've been overwhelmed.  Everything you've ever loved about superheroes is addressed in this film, from secret identities to the danger of wearing a cape.  Add to the mix an amazingly complex family drama and you have the absolute best film of the year.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), once the super hero of the year is now relegated to a cubicle in an insurance company, still trying to save the day (quietly) one claim at a time.  His wife, Helen, a.k.a Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) has also turned in her spandex, using her special powers to juggle the task of raising three kids instead of wrangling villains.  Their son, Dash, wants nothing more than to use his super speed to propel him to athletic glory. Violet, who has the ability to turn invisible and enclose her self within a forcefield broods like any normal teenager.  The baby, Jack Jack doesn't seem to have any super powers at all, unless you include making funny faces in a high chair.<br /><br />All of this is due to a Super Hero relocation program enacted by the government after public outcry over property damage and personal injury( a very sharp and poignant jab at our own litigious nature).  Forced to hide greatness behind a shroud of mediocrity the Incredible family do their best to blend in with normal society, and for the most part succeed.<br /><br />Of course events unfold to bring all of the Incredibles super powers to light, and for this to occur you need to introduce the mad genius villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee).  Parents, here's where the PG rating comes from, because this is one really, really bad guy.  A former superhero fan with an enormous chip on his shoulder Syndrome is like every James Bond baddie rolled into one.  His gadgets are unique, insanely cool, and above all extremely deadly.  Some dark thematic elements and violence cemented the MPAA's decision to slap Pixar with its first above G rating.  However, this movie could not have been done properly without giving the audience such a nefarious nemesis to loathe.<br /><br />In costume and out you will constantly root for the Incredibles, this movie is what going to the theater is all about, non-stop entertainment.  The action sequences are positively synapse blowing.  The script is Oscar worthy in its ability to seamlessly weave domestic drama and comic book daring-do.  Of course the animation has to be seen to be believed, and your eyes will bulge for the film's duration.<br /><br />I can't imagine this film not being successful but I hope it destroys box office records and mends the wound that has Pixar and Disney going their separate ways.  Because if ever there was a film that demanded a sequel it is The Incredibles.  An animation masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>In 2004, Pixar Animated Studios would go on to unfamiliar territory and that is creating a film not based on animals or insects but to create an animated film featuring humans.<br /><br />With the first five animated films from Pixar Animation Studios/Walt Disney having great financial success, needless to say, there was a lot of challenges and stress that the crew had to face this time around and to spearhead the project was Brad Bird, the writer and director who has worked on "The Simpsons" and "The Iron Giant" (and would go on to direct the Pixar animated film, "Ratatouille".<br /><br />Needless to say, "The Incredibles", which was budgeted at $92 million became a box office success, earning over $631 million worldwide, receiving nearly positive reviews from all critics and winning two Oscars for "Best Achievement in Sound Editing" and "Best Animated Feature Film of the Year".<br /><br />And now this successful animated film receives its HD treatment with a new Blu-ray release in April 2011 featuring new special features.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1).  First, let me first say that even though this animated film was released back in 2004 and within the improvement of computer animation in the last six years, the film still manages to hold up very well!  In fact, this is probably the best video version to date as the Blu-ray really shows off the vibrant colors of the film.<br /><br />Hair strands are much more notable, but also the detail of the fabric of the clothing is also much more present and detailed that you can see the actual stitching.  Blacks are inky and deep and the special effects absolutely look awesome.  And while I didn't see any compression artifacts or any major defects on the picture quality, I did notice very little banding.  In one scene, where Mr. Incredible shows off his new red costume, you can see a little banding but really, this is the best I have seen of "The Incredibles" by far.  From the debris, to the presentation of the city and jungle landscape, this film looks awesome on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  And if there was one thing that really shined for this film on Blu-ray, it was the lossless soundtrack as not only was dialogue crisp but every sound and boom, you can feel it via LFE.  I love action films that know how to use the LFE and really make you fel it and in this case, "The Incredibles" delivers!  Also, the surround channels are well-utilized as you can hear various ambiance from surrounding objects to little rustling that can be heard as well.  Literally, the lossless soundtrack delivers in immersive sound that really gives you a feeling of the action that is taking place!  Awesome!<br /><br />After watching "The Incredibles" so many times on DVD, the soundtrack, while very good, never made me take notice as it did with it listening to it on Blu-ray.  Not only was this lossless soundtrack magnificent, it definitely make a big difference during my viewing and enhanced my love for the film.  Audiophiles will love the lossless soundtrack!<br /><br />As for subtitles, they are in English, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Incredibles" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1<br /><br />  * Director's Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by producer John Walker and director Brad Bird.

Also, included is a digital copy of the feature film which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Pixar is known for creating a good number of wonderful films but I have to admit that "The Incredibles" has continued to become one of my favorites and probably is the only Pixar animated film that I have watch possibly over a dozen times and have not gotten tired of it.<br /><br />I remember when I first watched the film, I was just amazed not just by the animation and design but also the storyline and the relationship between Bob and Helen and just grown-up things that happen in the film that probably would fly over the head of children but make the adults smile.<br /><br />And I'm sure that many people own this film on DVD, it's whether or not you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray version.  And the answer to that is YES!  You do want to upgrade as it is not only jsut a better video and audio transfer but you also have new special features featuring the crew of "The Incredibles" really giving us fantastic insight of what went on behind-the-scenes in the creation of this film.<br /><br />We hear about the challenges and the long hours it takes to create an animated film but in the case of "The Incredibles", I never knew that a higher-up at Disney opposed the film, I never knew about the intense feelings the crew had and how morale was low at one point because of communication issues.  There was a lot of things that happened during the making of this film and you start to realize how much of a challenge these individuals, these departments at Pixar had to face when creating this film.  Definitely it was not easy but at the end of the day, the entire crew delivered another Pixar hit!<br /><br />Not only was it well-received, not only did it make a lot of money but it was a film that managed to hook in both young and old.  And it's important to note that at the time when Pixar Animation Studios had films based on toys, insects, animals, etc., to have an all-human based storyline that was well-planned, well-written and well-executed made "The Incredibles" so entertaining and fun!<br /><br />Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine wrote that "The Incredibles" was #6 on his list of the best films of the decade and to tell you the truth, when I think about films that I have watched more than 3-5 times in the last decade, there are not many.  "The Incredibles", I have probably watched about a dozen times or even more than that.  There are not many films that deal with many realistic issues that couples face and yet putting a superhero/sci-fi twist to it, "The Incredibles" is an exciting film that will continue to entertain generations to come.<br /><br />"The Incredibles: 4-Disc Combo Pack" is an excellent release.  A first Blu-ray disc with the movie and new special features, a second Blu-ray with new and all the classic DVD special features, a DVD and also a digital copy of the film.  This is truly a magnificent release from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and fans should be happy with this release, especially with how awesome this film looks on Blu-ray and its wonderful lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>As a parent of two kids I have had to sit through some awful films; "Home on the Range" anyone? So I was excited to see previews for "The Incredibles", it looked like the perfect family movie, something I could enjoy and the kids could as well. "The Incredibles" lives up to the hype. Both of my kids couldn't stop talking about it and want to go again...even (gasp!) choosing to see this again over Spongebob when it comes out! The story is a lot of fun, and it's funny, how now, as a 30+ year old cubicle dweller, I can relate to Mr. Incredible and his longing for past glories. Pixar's animation is, as always, a real treat. It's amazing how Pixar's characters just come to life, and express more emotional range than a gaggle full of Keanu Reeves. And though "The Incredibles" is rated PG, there is nothing in the film that should keep you from taking your kids. This really is a great family film, and one that adults will be able to enjoy as much as the kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ.html">A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ</a><br/><p>If I could sum up Pixar's latest offering in one word it would be, Incredible.<br /><br />The film is a marriage made in heaven as most people would agree that Pixar animation films rock because of the animation.  Most kids (and kids at heart) also mark out big time for superheroes movies and cartoons SO a Pixar animated Super Hero flick = $$$,$$$.$$<br /><br />THE PLOT:<br /><br />The movie opens up almost like a scene out of the Batman or Spider-Man or Superman cartoons with Mr. Incredible out and about saving the day.<br /><br />From there the film takes a humorous twist with all super-heroes being banned from practicing their trade due to lawsuits (ah yes, only in the 21st Century can you SUE a super-hero for saving lives) and we fast forward to see the super-heroes fat and out of shape and bored.<br /><br />We also see that our two main characters Mr. Incredible and Elasti-Girl are now married with three mutant kids of their own.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible is tricked back into action by two old conniving rivals with a dastardly plot to destroy him and all the former superheroes.  When all looks bleak with Mr. Incredible sidelined it takes the combined power of the Incredibles family to save him.<br /><br />THE COOL THINGS:<br /><br />I TOTALLY dug the vibe throughout the movie.  With the initial Batman vibe as Mr. Incredible makes his way throughout town saving lives and helping people and the later "Fantastic Four" and "Bionic Six" vibe the movie TOTALLY rocked my world.<br /><br />The plot villain is masterfully inserted into the film with a legitimate grudge against our hero and is brilliantly weaved in and out of the film.  Awesome writing, character development and continuity from the Pixar gang.  Plus, he's actually a cool (if geeky/dorky) villain.<br /><br />Seeing the kids come out of their shells and display and use their cool powers was awesome.  Pixar's animation gets better and better and most of all the movie's ending seems to leave open the possibilities for a SEQUEL.<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br /><br />Hey, if you dig Pixar animation or Super-Hero flicks or toons, you KNOW you'll see this one.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>I was completely unprepared to like this computer-animated film.  A smart, witty script, excellent animation by Pixar, and the talented voices of Holly Hunter, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and filmmaker Brad Bird have combined to create a winner that both kids and adults will appreciate, albeit on different levels.  Mr. Incredible (Nelson) loves saving the world, even though he likens it to cleaning a room only to turn around and find it messy again.  His soon-to-be wife Elastigirl (Hunter) is just as tough in her pursuit of justice, and often comes to her beloved's rescue.  The city is full of super heroes who do the work of police and who receive thunderous applause after their life-saving exploits.  Unfortunately for the super heroes, their glory days fade in a hail of lawsuits (people don't want to be saved and others use their injuries while in peril against the super heroes), and so all those with superpowers must enter normal life in a kind of witness-protection program.  The Incredibles, now with three children, face a mundane life as Bob/Mr. Incredible supports the family with an insurance adjuster job, and Helen/Elastigirl struggles to stop sibling squabbles.  Helen and Bob have become archetypal suburban parents, arguing about the kids and chores.  Bob and his friend Frozone (Jackson) long for the good old days when they felt like real men.  When Bob blows his cover, he is recruited by the mysterious Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) for some top secret superhero work.  Of course, Helen knows nothing about it--she's too busy dealing with baby Jack Jack, risk-taking Dash, and reclusive teenager Violet.  Predictably, Bob gets into trouble, and Helen has no choice but to don her old costume.  Fashion designer Edna (Bird) gives the Incredibles both the push and the pizzazz they need to reclaim their rightful spots as superheroes.<br /><br />The strength of this movie is the action-packed plot coupled with witty satire about contemporary American life.  Like all aging suburbanites, the Incredibles have developed beer guts (Bob) and wide hips (Helen).  They argue about issues that couples argue about everywhere, from financial concerns to not taking asked-for advice to ignoring the needs of the other.  The young Helen is a feminist who refuses to leave saving the world "to the men," but she becomes a stay-at-home mom who shuttles the kids to and from school, cooks family dinners, and finds herself responsible for almost all of the kids' upbringing.  The young Bob revels in his prowess, but in middle age he is beaten down by bureaucracy and a junky car.  Small details, such as the "graduation" between fourth and fifth grade and the way lawsuits twist the truth, make these otherwise extraordinary people ordinary.<br /><br />This sharp-witted adventure movie will delight both kids and adults.  The hilarious extra "Jack Jack Attack" should not be missed, especially since it fills in some details referred to in the movie itself.  Buy or rent this movie - and prepare yourself for some real entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>This was an impressive film.  I have not had the best of luck with PIXAR films lately.  I didn't really see the creativity in Monsters, Inc and Finding Nemo literally gave me the sweats when I watched it, so there was some hesitancy to see what PIXAR could do to topple their past mega-hits.  Well, what they crafted was something so out of left field that even I, the movie kinda guy, never saw it coming.  They made a very witty, intelligently clever, powerfully smart adult cartoon.  While there were elements throughout the film that I felt children would enjoy, I did feel as if 92% of this film was invested with the intelligent adult in mind.  There is great respect paid to the superheroes of my father's generation as well as a specific intent to downplay the "cute" element and keep us glued to our seats with action, suspense, and some of the most ingenious animation to be seen this side of the Mississippi.<br /><br />From beginning to end, this film reeked perfection in a way that other films only aspire to smell like.  It not only gave us this huge pre-story about what was happening in the world of superheroes (a concept that seemed taboo in the past), but it also gave us this enormous family dynamic that allowed each character to be built from the floor up.  Each of our characters has their own dilemma, their own style, and their own hurdles that they need to cross, and Brad Bird gives them each their moment to shine.  While he does focus heavily on our "head of family" Mr. Incredible, he gives so much attention to detailing the rest of the characters and scenes that you never feel this uneven balance.  This is a story about family, about realizing that you are "super", and that powers are not needed to realize this.  These are huge issues to cover in a animated film, but Bird succeeds in these three ways:<br /><br />First, he gives the film the time that it deserves.  This is not some mere 89 minute film that never develops anything, never takes a chance, nor allows our characters to shine, but instead a very hefty 121 minutes of sheer pleasure.  This is also why I think Bird had adults in mind while creating this visual feast, I know of very few children's films that are that extensive, normally you loose the child too quickly, but perhaps Bird wasn't aiming towards that audience.  At least, that is what I witnessed.<br /><br />Second, Bird gives us this huge world that is not surrounded by animated boundaries.  We do not stay in just one city, we do not loiter around the superhero's house all day, and we do not get pulled into normal animated clich&eacute;s like the man saves the day and gets himself that woman he has always wanted.  The Incredibles went in a completely new, fresh, and somewhat tangent direction that gave it the power to grow before our eyes.  That is what I completely enjoyed about this film was the fact that I could not forsee the future, meaning that there were no building clich&eacute;s that gave me a direct path to the end.  I had to guess, consider all possibilities, and reason with new ones that were unfolding before me.  It was an adventure, not just a simple piece of cinema.<br /><br />Third, and this is huge, was the main worry that I had with this film was the possible "baby" moments.  I was so worried that we would find ourselves wasting time watching, listening, or gasp laughing at the "cute" baby factor.  I thought that this was a path that Bird was going to travel towards, and would have ultimately caused this review to be a bit more tilted.  But, this wasn't a film for a child was it?  So, Bird left out most of the scenes dealing with the child and thus forced us to see the adults dealing with very mature themes and scenarios.  This factor was huge in indicating that perhaps Bird had a separate audience in mind.<br /><br />Overall, this was an amazing film to watch, experience, and enjoy.  The bold use of colors complimented the sensation of the characters that carried with them similar attributes.  Brad Bird skillfully crafted this film that had every possibility of being clich&eacute;d and overbearingly geared towards children, but instead he took a higher road and gave us this film that will last the test of time due greatly in part to giving us, the adults in the world, an opportunity to indulge and enjoy the power of animated cinema.  In every attempt not to sound redundant, this film was "incredible".  The characters were beautiful, the story was solid, and the powerful voice acting allowed this film to rank among the top of my PIXAR favorites.  I highly recommend this film to anyone that is an avid superhero fan or simply is looking for an adventurous ride into the future of our movie business.  WOW.  That is all I can say ... "WOW".<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>This 2 DVD release of The Incredibles is truly something to rave about. The movie plot is well thought out and voiced by the actors; the cinematography, choreography and animation are superlative; and Pixar makes a movie about characters you can actually care about! The picture quality is flawless. The movie even won Best Animated Feature Film of the year at the Oscars just two weeks ago! What a coup! GRIN<br /><br />The story (as some people may know) is about a family called The Incredibles. At first Mr. Incredible is doing what any normal superhero would do, you know-save the city from destruction and balance this with family life. Then because of politics and lawsuits against superheroes as a group the family is forced into a "relocation" program because it is no longer so wonderful to be a superhero anymore! (They even are given new names to protect them against the proliferation of lawsuits against the do-gooder superhero group! Now are they the Parr family.) Mr. Incredible (now going by the name Mr. Parr) is bored and miserable (to say the least); he gets an offer to do some extra work and he takes it. (I'm keeping this part brief to avoid plot spoilers.) Ultimately, things turn rotten and then Mr. Incredible HIMSELF has to be rescued instead of the other way around! Moreover, look for some well written great scenes regarding the family's personal issues: how the people in The Incredibles family deal with being different; how Bob and his wife deal with the fact that she is comfortable as a mother while he still craves the superhero "lifestyle;" how the issue of mortality is played out; and what the children go through as they try to conceal their differences from most others in the world. Yes, the film is essentially an action movie with some violence but don't let that fool you. There are quite a few poignant moments here. The PG rating is because of a few of the action scenes; so remember that this movie is not the best choice for toddlers or children who might get upset by it. Some people also say it's a few minutes too long-again, DON'T let them or even Amazon reviewers tell you that; this movie is terrific and I was really sorry when it ended! The last hour especially is action packed and very well done!<br /><br />The movie won a second Oscar for sound editing at this year's Academy Awards ceremony; and it was nominated for an Oscar for its achievement in sound mixing but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The two DVD set is presented here with an almost endless assortment of "incredible" (!) extras! There are two full length commentaries on disc one. One commentary is by Director/Writer Brad Bird and Producer Jon Walker and some of the animators do an audio commentary on the second track. The first track is indeed more personal since the two men had such a close personal relationship; but the second track is a real must for the serious animation enthusiast who's got to know about the process of animated film production. There are so many deleted scenes! I can't remember when I saw a two DVD set with so many deleted scenes-decide for yourself which ones might have worked well in the movie! There is the exclusive short "Jack-Jack Attack" about Jack finding out he has special powers while Kari the babysitter is there with him. There's the extra "Incredi-Blunders" and TWO features (not just one) about the making of this movie. There'll be very little left unanswered for anyone after they watch both of these! The interviews with Director Brad Bird are captivating and really informative! GRIN<br /><br />Something else that is interesting is the extra "Vowellet," an essay by Sarah Powell, who voices Violet Parr: a great insight regarding Powell's perception of voicing an animated superhero. Then there's "Boundin'," a short Oscar nominated feature about a sheep with a bad haircut!  My personal favorite of the shorts would have to be "Mr. Incredible and Pals," a short made to resemble something found after being lost in a vault somewhere since the 1960s. The characters in this animated short move their mouths the way animators drew the mouths at that time. This extra includes Frozone and a mute rabbit named Mr. Skipperdoo.<br /><br />Obviously, this is a grand slam home run for Pixar-and WE reap the rewards watching it over and over again! I highly recommend this two DVD set. When choosing it, remember that this is sold in EITHER full screen or wide screen; both versions are not being sold within the same package. Regardless of which view you choose you can't go wrong since Pixar has produced the full screen version so that all the action is viewable on your screen. Go ahead; try to find a better developed and reproduced two DVD animated movie-you'd be mighty lucky to achieve this; I don't think there's anything else around as well done as this!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>The Incredibles<br />Directed by Brad Bird<br />Starring the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee<br /><br />Disney / Buena Vista | 2004 | 115 min | Rated PG | Released Apr 12, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 ES Matrix<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1 EX<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1 EX<br />English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Four-disc set (2 BDs, 2 DVDs)<br />DVD copy<br />Digital copy<br /><br />Pixar has given us lovable monsters, fish, ants, rats, toys, cars, a service robot and a floating house. None of those subjects sounded particularly interesting to me, but I ended up loving every film. It's hard to select a favorite because every one has merit, but I would pick Ratatouille if forced to choose. That was written and directed by Brad Bird who also wrote and directed The Incredibles.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of superhero movies in general. They tend to focus on the special powers of the superhero and tell us very little else. The characters are usually little more than sketches. That said, each one is highly anticipated and almost guarantees success at the box office. It's the most popular genre. Christopher Nolan elevated the genre to a new level with Batman Begins and the hugely popular Dark Knight. They remain my favorite superhero movies by far, but why do I believe that?<br /><br />Nolan gives his characters depth and we understand why they do what they do. He also makes it seem possible that they can do what they do. Quite simply, I believe that such characters could exist.<br /><br />The Incredibles uses a similar technique and puts the characters in today's world. What happens to superheroes that grow old and fat? What do they do when they aren't foiling crimes? What if they try to help someone who doesn't want to be helped? Do superheroes marry and start a family? If they did, would their children also have special powers?<br /><br />All of these things are addressed and more.<br /><br />We learn some of the character's motivations at the beginning of the movie when they are interviewed on TV. Each superhero is introduced. We meet Mr. Incredible (strength), Elastigirl (flexibility) and Frozone (freezes things). There's also a boy who calls himself Incrediboy and wants to be Mr. Incredibles' sidekick, but he's rejected and not allowed to become part of the team.<br /><br />After a series of incidents end in people suing the superheroes, the government forces them to retire, relocate and live as normal people. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl marry and have three children. Violet can become invisible and make force shields, while her brother, Dash, runs at an incredible speed. Baby Jack-Jack is still developing his powers.<br /><br />They are known as the Parr family and try to remain inconspicuous. Mr. Incredible and Frozone pine for the old days and secretly fight crime by lying to their wives and claiming to go bowling. They are being monitored and Mr. Incredible is given a solo mission by an unknown agency. He succeeds, but almost dies in the process. We learn that Incrediboy has never recovered from the rejection 15 years earlier and that he's been scheming to get his revenge under his new name, Syndrome.<br /><br />The movie is full of invention. Although many of the characters seem to have been inspired by the Fantastic Four, they use their powers in unpredictable ways. The family members are particularly good at combining their skills and there's a lot of humor in the film. Some of it is quite subtle and best appreciated by adults, but there's plenty for the kids too. It's an action-packed story filled with explosions and battles. Syndrome's hideout looks like something out of a James Bond movie, as do many of the gadgets.<br /><br />The conclusion is satisfying and paves the way for a sequel should Pixar ever decide to make one. This is a movie that has the potential to appeal to viewers of any age and it's a lot of fun. If I learned one thing it's that wearing a cape can be a dangerous business.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />Disney consistently produces wonderful transfers. Some of the classic titles were made 70 years ago and look better than ever. Pixar hasn't been around that long and the animation looks modern and three-dimensional. Every Pixar movie to date has been just about perfect and The Incredibles is no different.<br /><br />Sound Quality 5/5<br />The Incredibles is a good choice to show off your home theater system. As well as a stunning transfer, the sound quality will satisfy any movie enthusiast. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 ES mix is capable of shaking the room at times, but doesn't disappoint with the finer details. Dialogue and ambient sounds are all crystal clear.<br /><br />Special Features 5/5<br /><br />There are over eight hours of special features spread across two Blu-ray discs:<br /><br />Audio commentary with director Brad Bird and producer John Walker.<br /><br />Audio commentary with the animators.<br /><br />Bounding (short film, 4:40)<br /><br />Jack-Jack Attack (short film, 4:42)<br /><br />Jack-Jack Attack Exploded (the short with a commentary track, 4:43)<br /><br />The Incredibles Revisited (22:06)<br /><br />Paths to Pixar: Story Artists (5:53)<br /><br />Studio Stories: Gary's Birthday (1:24)<br /><br />Ending with a Bang: Making the End Credits (1:35)<br /><br />The New Nomanisan: A Top Secret Redevelopment Plan (3:30)<br /><br />Deleted Scenes in HD (35 minutes)<br /><br />Incredibles Teaser (2 minutes)<br /><br />Classic Content: A 27-minute making of feature and around 70 minutes looking at the design of the movie.<br /><br />Art Gallery<br /><br />Trailers for The Lion King and Cars 2<br /><br />Free movie ticket for Cars 2 (enter your DMR code and print the ticket - expires Aug. 7)<br /><br />Disney titles look wonderful on Blu-ray.

What makes a true hero? Is it his or her talents and abilities (in this case, the ability to knock down buildings or stretch like a rubber band or run super-fast)? Or is it something more subtle, something in the spirit, the courage to face up to one's foibles and weaknesses and overcome them and in doing so, make the world a better place. Is it better to celebrate mediocrity, the concept that everyone is "special", or should we not celebrate the exceptional ones among us, uplift them and admire them for their special contributions to the world? If you are a thoughtful person, this movie will leave you asking these questions. It will also leave you laughing, the dialogue is hilarious, the characters realistic and believable. The romance-obsessed teenager, the mischievous little boy, the housewife who is suppressing her true heroic nature, and the husband withering away in a cube farm--these are people you meet every day, and you might be one of them. This is a brilliant example of perfect movie-making.

Once restricted to kiddie type movies with talking fish, toys, and or monsters, THE INCREDIBLES is an animated James Bond movie with a dash of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER and FATHER KNOWS BEST.  Writer/director Brad Bird gives us endless scenes of peril, fast chases, derring do and a considerable amount of violence for the "expected" animated film.  But as I said, this is not what we are accustomed to in animated entertainment.  The animation in this film is unquestionably incredible; you won't remember seeing anything quite this cinematic like in your usual animated fare.  The voice actors are superb, from Craig T. Nelson's Mr. Incredible to Brad Bird's amazing Edna Mode; from Holly Hunter's Elastigirl to Jason Lee's Sindrome.  The Actors Guild should protest the lack of credit the voice actors are given in these films.  In the closing credits, while struggling to see who voiced who, the voice cast is so small one can hardly read it, while all the tech guys are larger than life.  I for one am interested in who did what, so that's just a hint for future animated films.  Don't forget the movie would be nothing without the voices, folks!<br /><br />Anyway, to criticize this movie in any way would be almost anti-American, so I'll only say that while this movie is definitely a crowd pleaser and sets new standards, it is a little too violent in nature for younger children and it only reinforces the amount of violence propagated by our video games and now our cartoons.  So, while I hope we see more imaginative films like this one, I hope Pixar and others don't forget the animated films that AREN'T realistic or lifelike.  Movies still need to take us to places that we aren't going to feel like we live in; talking animals, far out space adventures..we still have a place for them, that I hope the success of THE INCREDIBLES does not diminish.  Nonetheless, THE INCREDIBLES is an incredible achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>I don't generally expect a lot from full-length animated films, but this one (like _Shrek_) is an exception. The idea of a superhero family permanently undercover because of lawsuits is neat, to begin with. Craig T. Nelson gives a very believable style to "Bob Parr" (Mr. Incredible), as does Holly Hunter to Elastigirl. In fact, the animators managed to give all the characters a high degree of individuality and the scriptwriters included lots and lots of sometimes abstruse references to the world of comic books. Nice homage to Edith Head, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>AN ANIMATED FAMILY OF X-MEN -- COMPLETE WITH SPANDEX<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: IT ALL TURNS OUT PRETTY - - WELL - - INCREDIBLE:<br /><br />Pixar and Disney have made six exceptional films together, but I find myself reaching for this one almost every time.<br /><br />Needless to say, superhero films are no longer novelties, yet this film seems to have new angles on seemingly cliched themes. The lawsuits that put the "Supers" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed "The Incredibles" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well - - PRETTY INCREDIBLE!<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />First we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as "Supers" and instead turns into Mr. & Mrs. Average American after the lawsuits that ended the "Supers" crime fighting dynasty. Along the way they had three very different yet "Super" offspring! Wow, that's enough right there to keep us busy.<br /><br />We also have sub-plots which include each one of the 3 children's coming of age in a "Super" way, but as ordinary kids. The kids, like their parents, struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family.<br /><br />We have Bob Parr [Mr. Incredible] going through what appears to be a mid-life crisis, and his confused wife, Helen, who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else. But, after all, how can "Elastigirl" be just another soccer mom? We have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan [Buddy] who turns "The Incredibles" lives upside-down and inside-out. For the first time, the "Supers" are the underdogs!<br /><br />EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS - SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES & MUCH MORE:<br /><br />After these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles' family issues worked out like any other family's, but with many interesting twists. "The Incredibles" is a SUPER film!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />DVD FEATURES: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.39:1 [very widescreen] Digital to Digital Transfer is the SHARPEST I have seen yet!<br /><br />Lots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did.<br /><br />The "Jack-Jack Attack" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between "Jack-Jack" and the baby-sitter. I just wish it was longer. The behind the scenes "Featurettes" are worth watching as are the blooper scenes, though they seem a bit contrived.<br /><br />There are two commentary tracks, one with Brad Bird [writer/director] and John Walker [producer]. and another with the animators. I could not watch the entire movie with either track on. Maybe you can. The files about the "Supers" are interesting. There is lots more. If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />For me, however, there is the film. This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun-filled, family sort of way. It has all of the entertainment value of "Toy Story" or "Finding Nemo", but has more appeal for adult audiences in my view.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Here they come, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet and Dash, the greatest animated superhero family ever! The animation and plot couldn't be any better and the action/adventure, comedy value of this film is just... well..., dare I say it, INCREDIBLE!!<br /><br />A 'Film of the Ages' for all ages, so get the family around the television set with all the pre-requistes; popcorn, candy and soft drinks and strap yourself in for non-stop entertainment that you'll enjoy more and more with each repeat viewing.<br /><br />Reminder: Mandatory superhero outfits for everyone!</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>There is nothing not to like about The Incredibles!  As with all the best recent animated films, the jokes may be over a kid's head, but that is what keeps the parents buying the tickets.  The Incredibles is a fun look at heros similar to the ones we all grew up with...only a little older.  This is one of those movies that is so good you hope the DON'T make a sequel.  A sequel would only cheapen this originally funny film.  After all, there really is nothing to add to this imaginative piece of art.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Apart from the stunning CG - facial expression, light composition, fluid movements, graphic design ... etc, The Incredibles sets itself apart with its detailed plot and the meticulously crafted personalities of the main characters. While the young audience will be pleased with the action sequences and sound, the story strikes a deep chord with the middle aged Moms and Dads.<br /><br />This is the comic version of Parenthood, Desperate Housewives, Cosby Show, Eight is Enough all mixed together. Every few minutes, real family issues come up and make The Incredibles family so genuinely human. 2 scenes particularly appealed to me - (1)Dad landed on a luscious green island to rescue the world. He wanted to flex his superhero muscles and make a sprint, only to find his body failed him.  (2)Mom and the 2 kids, nearly drowned in the sea, pulled themselves together and speeded to the island to save Dad.<br /><br />As entertaining as you can get, this is definitely a must-watch family movie. What's more, it is a piece of art and chicken soup for the adults. The bonus features contain alternate opening scenes, story boards and what a feat the production team had pulled off! Simply awesome.</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>I loved this film because of the James Bond influences , which  are in the plot , the music and the atmosphere also - at times .<br /><br />It was funny and quite poignant at times . I have no problem with something that is designed to be for mass acceptance if it's this good . I knew I was getting subtly manipulated , but at least this is only a movie .<br /><br />How any other adults have enjoyed shows like SHREK and FINDING NEMO ?

Or maybe I'm a sucker for super heroes. Maybe I like almost everything that comes out of Pixar inordinately. Or maybe I like the 60's style jazz they use for the music - especially at the end. Maybe I just like James Bond type movies, with all the gadgets and exotic locations - and there are plenty in this movie. Or maybe I love modern architecture and design. Maybe I just like the color red! I don't know - but this movie really worked on me, and it was great!<br /><br />Director Brad Bird has brought together all these elements, plus good writing, funny dialog, and enough suspense and surprise to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're into the visual elements, your eyes will have a feast. Now that I think of it, so will your ears because, besides the music, the sound effects are awesome. What's really incredible is that you feel like the physical objects in this movie are real. Like Mr. Incredible's (Bob's) car - after it's been downsized to a normal, economy car - which is featured in several gags. It looks and moves like a real - albeit, toy  - car, complete with broken door. Same for most things in this film.<br /><br />There is a possible disappointment to the realism: the people don't look like flesh and blood, which you might expect in a world that, otherwise, seems so real. They look like animated dolls with rubber skin. But, somehow, that's okay. You kind of buy into the fact that these are cartoon characters rather than real people. And yet, I would love to take their place in some of those high tech environments - especially on the island where Syndrome hangs out.<br /><br />Something else that disappoints a bit: Syndrome. I couldn't get past the fact that he looked like a kid even after he had grown up. It's hard to take seriously or be threatened by a villain that looks like a kid. But maybe that's the point: the filmmakers have their tongues in their cheeks. Which is probably true of most of this film. It is definitely a spoof - but not totally. If you're a kid at heart, you'll be taking a lot of it more seriously than you think.<br /><br />All the characters are memorable, but I've got to say, besides Mr. Incredible, my favorite is Baby Jack. There just wasn't enough of him in the film to suit me; so I was glad the filmmakers provided an additional cartoon featuring him on the DVD. It's really funny.<br /><br />Even though this film was mostly about the art and design for me, that is not to suggest that the plot, dialogue, voice acting and other aspects aren't up to par: they are. That's why the movie is so darn funny and so entertaining. Craig Nelson (Mr. Incredible), Holly Hunter (Elastigirl), Samuel L. Jackson (Frozone), Jason Lee (Syndrome), plus the others all did incredible jobs.<br /><br />It's hard to think of a better word to describe this film than its title: incredible. It may not be quite as remarkable as Toy Story, which will always hold a special place in Pixar-lovers' hearts. But in many ways it is better, and certainly holds its own with the other offerings of the Pixar team. Those guys, themselves, seem pretty incredible to me.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I admit that I was not attracted to this motion picture. I had no desire to watch it. Then my 6 year old asked if we could buy it on pay per view. And what is my opinion now that I've seen it? I love it! In fact, I would watch it again and again. It exceeded expectations. Mr. Incredible was hilarious.<br /><br />The Incredibles is a movie about a super hero that is forced into retirement but, alas, his heart is still with saving the world from danger. He heads to the suburbs where he takes a lame desk job (like the one I have). Occasionally he sneaks out to rescue someone from a fire, etc, but he does it behind his wife's back.<br /><br />Along the way Mr. Incredible has 3 incredible children who, of course, all have unique superpowers. Mr. Incredible inevitably gets drawn into peril, gets a new hero suit, and goes off to save the world against a very evil villain. (I won't spoil you with clues as to who it is). Mr. Incredible's family joins him in this adventure, and the world is restored to happiness.<br /><br />The Incredibles is a movie for all ages. The humor is actually humorous, and I found myself laughing out loud many times. The Incredibles are not crude or obnoxious other than the kids having an occasional verbal scuffle. In general the movie is immersive, flows very well, and makes 90 minutes seem like 30.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>There are two crowds with this movie. Those who think it was OK, and those who think it is brilliant. Few dislike it.<br /><br />My thoughts here are strong -- Brilliant, and then some.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is the beginning of a new era of superhero movies. It pokes at the genre, and it tells a fantastic story in the process. More than a parody, it has a rich pro-family flavor, folded into a drama about relationships, yet never taking itself too seriously.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />Take a couple with superpowers, move them into a federal protection program after superheroes are sued, give them three kids who aren't allowed to use their powers, and wait. Prod them occasionally with anxiety and restlessness to keep them in minor trouble. Soon, a powerful, intelligent enemy bent on becoming a self-made messiah will come along.<br /><br />Will the retired and in-hiding superheroes don the uniforms and save the day? Can they after all these years? Who is this amazing arch enemy?<br /><br />Does my version of the plot tell as well as it works in the movie? Probably not, because what is missing is the funny sight gags, situation humor, and spectacular animation. You also don't hear the swift one-liners, allusions to classic comic books or sarcasm about society.<br /><br />The movie soars farther than the average superhero movie because, like Spiderman, it looks into the reality of the kind of personal life a superhero would have. If a world with superheroes existed, what would it be like? While the X-Men movies have attempted to address this, the concept of Charles Xavier's mansion is not easy to believe. Thinking that after Mr. Incredible unretired, he would have a beer gut is believable. These superheroes are just like us, after all, only "super."<br /><br />The art and design of "The Incredibles" is not the usual either. Calling it art may seem too much, and I don't want to suggest that this is an animated version of the Louvre. However, "The Incredibles" angles beyond comic book art, and into art deco, and pop art akin to a more sophisticated, moving Andy Warhol.<br /><br />The messages in the movie encourage us to be ourselves, be humble, do the right thing, and, in the case of peril, be courageous.<br /><br />I fully recommend "The Incredibles." I am looking for a sequel or two, and am hoping they can continue this style and quality.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Nominated for four Academy Awards, and winner of Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, The Incredibles is one of the best animated films ever produced. A cross between Toy Story, Superman, and Office Space, it provides an endless array of action sequences, visual creativity, and well-delivered humor. Director Brad Bird (who's directed a few episodes of The Simpsons) not only creates a memorable film, but also voices one of the star characters of The Incredibles, Edna Mode. And following in the rich tradition of animated classics such Bambi (1942), Beauty and the Beast (1991), and The Lion King (1994), Walt Disney Pictures teams up once again with Pixar Animation Studios (with whom it collaborated on Finding Nemo) to produce a film both children and adults will love with equal verve and passion...<br /><br />The Incredibles is set in the fictional cartoon township of Metroville (a hybrid of Superman's two homes, Metropolis and Smallville). Metroville is home to a number of miraculous superheroes who do everything from hunting down evil murderers to saving cats stuck in trees. Foremost among the superheroes is Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) who resembles Superman in both strength and style. Shortly after Mr. Incredible's marriage to the vivacious Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), a surge in civil lawsuits and other unwarranted torts are brought against the superheroes by the people they save, who cite numerous damages to their person as a result of being saved. The rash of legal action, and the strain it places on the local governmental budget, turns the tide of public opinion against the superheroes and forces them underground.<br /><br />Harbored by the government witness protection program, Mr. Incredible has assumed a new identity - that of Bob Parr, an ordinary middle-class suburbanite who works as an Insurance Claims Specialist. Cowering in his cubicle, Bob Parr must deal with the typical travails of a 9-to-5 job, a boss he hates, and regulations he feels are immoral and hurtful to the company's clients. Meanwhile, Elastigirl is now known as Helen Parr, and she's grown comfortable in her new role as a housewife rearing the couple's three suppressed-superhero children - Violet (a shy girl with the ability to turn invisible), Dash (a cocky boy with the ability to run super fast), and Jack Jack (a baby with no as-of-yet-known super powers). All goes well until Mr. Incredible, anxious to return to life of helping people, is approached by a super secret government organization hoping to enlist his aid. When it turns out to be part of an elaborate conspiracy hatched by the evil Syndrome (Jason Lee), a former Mr. Incredible sycophant turned bad, Elastigirl and the entire Parr family must risk blowing their cover in order to save Mr. Incredible, and the world, from certain doom...<br /><br />The Incredibles deserves a spot on anyone's list of the Top 100 films ever made. It really is that good. The musical score, composed by Michael Giacchino (know for his work on Alias), sneers at today's digital multi-track recording in favor of the old-school analog recordings of the 1960s in its effort to recreate the jazz-orchestra ambience often associated with the golden age of comic books. This attention to the form and detail of the story sets the tone for The Incredibles. And that's why the film is an absolute must-see. Its meticulous blend of sound and visuals, coupled with an utterly hilarious - if not ingenious script - makes The Incredibles a solid contender for the best film of 2004...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Pixar animation has done it again!  Following in the footsteps of such classic animated films as "Finding Nemo" and "Toy Story", this fun-filled and action-packed film will be sure to captivate adults and children alike.<br /><br />Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter) are the former crime-fighters Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl.  Forced into retirement due to costly lawsuits and a slowly eroding base of support, they are placed in exile and must live the lives of "normal" people while forgoing their superpowers.  Their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack have inherited their parent's powers; Violet has the ability to turn invisible and Dash has super speed.  Jack-Jack's powers aren't revealed until the end of the film.<br /><br />Bob takes a job as an insurance adjuster while Helen has set up housekeeping.  Longing to return to his superhero days, Bob is contacted by Mirage (Elizabeth Pena).  She has a top-secret assignment for him on a remote island, but when he arrives, he soon finds out that he has been tricked and lured in by Syndrome (Jason Lee), the former Incrediboy who idolozed Mr. Incredible but was shunned by him.  Bent on revenge, Syndrome has created a robot that has the capacity to learn on its own and Syndrome is threatening to unleash the robot on the unsuspecting city while he in turn destroys the robot himself, making himself look like a real superhero.<br /><br />Helen gets wind of Bob's mysterious journey to the island, and soon she, Violet, and Dash are on the island searching for Bob.  Will Syndrome succeed in his mission?  Will Bob, Helen, Dash, and Violet stop him before its too late?<br /><br />This is a spectacular film.  As with the other successful Pixar films in this genre, the animation is excellent, and the story is first rate.  Although there are some violent parts in this movie, it is still safe for kids to view as well as adults.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  It has quickly become our children's favorite film, and we've watched it together several times, and it keeps getting better with each viewing.  Watch this highly entertaining and exciting film from Pixar and enjoy some animated fun and action!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Fans of Pixar and Disney should love this one. Just a fun family oriented movie. The animation is great, and the story and music will keep you watching. I didn't catch this at the theater but I based my purchase on the trailers, and I am glad I did. My wife and I watched it and we loved it. I'm sure all ages will get a kick out of it. It mainly centers on the father Mr. Incredible, but has plenty of input from Elastigirl/Mrs. Incredible and their kids as well. Frozone didn't get as much action as I would have liked, but still plenty of action and a good story as usual. It seems like a cross between a James Bond movie and Spiderman, but with a whole family of superheroes.<br /><br />The Pixar animation is excellent. I loved the way they developed the nemesis of Mr. Incredible from his biggest fan. When Elastigirl realizes Mr. Incredible has been gone to long she suspects foul play and goes looking for him. Mrs. Incredible finds assistance in tracking him down from their funny and unusual clothing designer. Little do they know that many heroes have been destroyed by the nemesis of Mr. Incredible and he plans to send the robot that destroyed them to invade the city. Time is of the essence as they rush to save Mr. Incredible and stop the maniac that will destroy anyone that stands in his way to be the only hero. The DVD two disc set has many extras and is well worth the price.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I am not going to go through what this movie is about; I just want to tell you not to miss viewing it.  If you like action, suspense, humor, great effects, wonderful characters and an outstanding story; you will LOVE this movie.<br /><br />Superhero's galore in one family that try so hard to become 'normal,' but realize just what is 'normal' for them if how they should be living their lives.<br /><br />We have a very evil villian and an adorable baby who is full of surprises. This is just an over-the-top movie and one that the entire family will enjoy watching together. Very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>nice touch of everything. i have no complaints only praises. didn't like to watch animation cartoons for a long long time. but not this one. this one is almost perfect!</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>The creators of "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo" look into the lives of a typical family of superheroes in the fantastic animated blockbuster "The Incredibles". After a series of unfortunate lawsuits, the mighty champion Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has retired to a simple suburban existence with his devoted wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and his super powered children but still longs for his old days of glory. When the mad inventor Syndrome (Jason Lee) seeks revenge on Mr. Incredible and other superheroes, this amazing family unites to save the day. Directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant), Pixar's latest CG release is an entertaining mix of rousing comic book adventure and heartfelt family comedy. Its clever storyline is certainly amusing. "The Incredibles" contains some great humor, enormous excitement, stunning CG animation and memorable characters like eccentric fashion designer Edna Mode. The 2004 computer-animated film also features the voice talents of Samuel L. Jackson as super cool hero Frozone.<br /><br />Disney continues to deliver first-rate DVD quality with the release of "The Incredibles" Collector's Edition. Pixar's latest animated smash hit is presented in its original theatrical widescreen format. The DVD has a razor-sharp video transfer with rich detailed colors and flawless sharpness. Its aggressive Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound is truly excellent. Among special features, this fully-loaded edition includes two audio commentaries with director Brad Bird and production crew, several deleted scenes, an alternate opening, fun outtakes, an informative "Making of The Incredibles" featurette and the amusing "Jack-Jack Attack" animated short. Overall, "The Incredibles" is an exceptional DVD and scores a worthy "A".</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>With the superhero craze in full swing, Pixar and Disney (mostly Pixar) are capitalizing on the success with their own version of the Superhero universe.<br /><br />Following the adventures of Mr. Incredible, the movie introduces us to the heroes in their heyday, when the city loved them and counted on them, until an ungrateful `jumper' sues them.  Suddenly in a swing of political correctness, the heroes are all asked to step down and become `normal'.  They are forced to never reveal who they are what they can do, being dragged down in everyday existence.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible, voiced with great charisma and world weary exhaustion by Craig T. Nelson, watches his life get more frustrating by the day.  His desire for the old days is overly apparent as he continues to play the hero, helping old ladies find loopholes in policies enforced by his insurance company employer.  He feeds his overwhelming desire in nightly excursions with his buddy, Frozone (voiced by Samual L. Jackson) listening to Police and Fire bands in order to find people to rescue or criminals to catch.<br /><br />One day he receives a job offer that could put him back in the role of superhero.  In taking the job, things get crazy and whole new menace begins to unfold.  In order to keep this review short, I will say that this movie is more exciting and fun to watch then almost anything else that was released in 2004, with the exception of Spider-Man 2.  The Incredibles is awesome, not only utilizing elements of comic books, but bringing in the real life detriments that could come with that line of work.  Also, strangely noted, is the James Bond-like spy movie elements when Mr. I goes to the remote island for the job offer.<br /><br />Holly Hunter and Jason Lee round out the voice characterizations, giving great quality to the cast and making the movie full of life.  The Incredibles is great fun and highly recommended.  I can't wait for the DVD to be released.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>I had highly anticipated seeing "The Incredibles" after seeing the trailer of Mr. Incredible himself trying to get his belt buckled and trying to convince himself and the wife he just wants salad for dinner, with maybe some rice cakes.<br /><br />Anyways, ironically enough, that scene wasn't even in the movie.  I believe it will be seen in the dvd version as a 'deleted scene' as I honestly don't remember seeing it in that 1 1/2 hours of film time.  You heard correctly, it's a full- length feature film and just because it's animated doesn't mean it's something just for kids. I've been a Pixar fan since "Toy Story", and I didn't have any kids at that time.  So , I warn parents of small children - You may have yourself a tough time trying to get toddling kiddies or drooling babies to sit through this one.<br /><br />My son, who is almost 4, was entranced..he loved it. His ending review was in one word: Awesome.<br /><br />Being a fan of cartoons, superheroes(watching super friends every saturday am growing up), and the everchanging face of the animated film, I have to agree with my roving movie reviewing son.<br /><br />It was the idea of 'retired' superheros, who come back to save the world that struck me as a unique idea for a movie. Plus, seeing one of them get way out of shape and then whip himself back into shape is one of the funniest parts of the movie.<br /><br />It did drag a bit, but I felt very much entertained by most parts.  It was an overall good time at the movies.<br /><br />I recommend it to ages 4 and up.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>While not quite up with the greatest of the Pixar films (Up, Wall-e,<br />Nemo, etc.) This is still smart, inventive and tremendous fun, with<br />some humanity thrown in to boot.<br /><br />For my money, more entertaining than any of the James Bond or superhero<br />films of recent vintage which it spoofs (and with more exciting action<br />besides!).<br /><br />In an alternate universe, Superheroes are told to stop being, well,<br />super, because of the risk of law suits and other problems.

He's got a wonderful wife, three beautiful kids, and a nice home in the suburbs. But Bob hates his job as an insurance claims representative. He sits in a tiny office (even more tiny for Bob because he's a big man and his office has this huge pillar going up one side) answering the phone, typing on a keyboard, and trying to actually help people who have problems. But, Bob's boss (a very tiny man) hates Bob because Bob agrees to almost every claim that is made. Bob also has another problem. Bob is actually a superhero: Mr. Incredible. He used to travel around the globe fighting off the forces of evil and standing up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. Then some guy who he saved from committing suicide decided to sue and all of America's superheroes had to go underground. Things haven't been the same since.<br /><br />One day, Bob gets really mad at work and throws his boss through a wall. He's fired, but a mysterious stranger offers Bob to opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again and Bob jumps at the chance. At first things go fine. But then Mr. Incredible gets in over his head (you know, the whole "I work best alone philosophy" and "I can't let my wife know I got fired" attitude). Eventually his wife, who happens to be Elastigirl, and kids come to the rescue and it's up to the Incredible family to save the world.<br /><br />Simply put, THE INCREDIBLES are simply incredible. THE INCREDIBLES is one of the best of Pixar's hits. The voice talents perfectly cast with Craig T. Nelson voicing Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter voicing his wife Elastigirl and Samuel L. Jackson as Increcible's best friend, Lucius Best--better known as Frozone.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLES contains a great deal of action and some mild violence. As Helen/Elastigirl tells her children before she sets off to rescue Dad, the bad guys here aren't like the bad guys on television, the bad guys here will kill kids if they get a chance. Like FINDING NEMO before it, THE INCREDIBLES is an amazing story of family love. It's also a reflection on temperance; finding the balance between what you were made to do and what everyone else in the world wants you to do.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLES was directed by Brad Bird. Previous to THE INCREDIBLES, Bird was best known for the animated film, THE IRON GIANT. Some of the same ideas dealt with in that movie are also dealt with in THE INCREDIBLES, but in a totally different fashion with a totally different setting and cast of characters. Bird also wrote the screenplay. In the movie there are clear influences from several great action films of the past, including STAR WARS. THE INCREDIBLES also resembles the graphic novel THE WATCHMEN by Alan Moore in some aspects, but in a very family-friendly way.<br /><br />The animated short included with the major feature is entitled BOUND. It's a story told in ballad about a proud sheep who is humbled after his first sheering, but is given a new look on life by a wise jackalope. Thank goodness there are jackalopes.<br /><br />Overall, THE INCREDIBLES is a great family movie. Watch it, then go hug your kids, call your parents, or re-acquaint yourself with that family member you haven't talked to in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>What a fascinating break from Pixar's usual jig of toys and furry creatures and the pat themes of parenting. This is all grown-up stuff but told with wit tighter than the spandex on our lovable Parrs family.<br /><br />The setups are clearly a throwback to older cartoons I've seen reruns of: Marvel Comics, Johnny Quest, Thunderbirds, even a welcome dose of James Bond.<br /><br />But it goes far beyond in musing over the private and often troubled lives of heroes once they shed their skin-tight robes and resume their secret identities. They talk like us, bleed like us, love like us, and you could almost imagine these heroes as next-door neighbors going off to their daily chores, which often involved saving the world from Armageddon.<br /><br />The film's production values are topnotch. The CGI is slick yet life-like, and the imagination behind some of the superheroic ruses is uncanny.<br /><br />The humor is sharp even when it flirts with comic book conventions without insulting them. For instance, a hilarious joke comes from a fashion designer who costumes superheroes but rants against capes as accessories. There's a funny montage of superhero mishaps that illustrate her point.<br /><br />The background score recreates the sound of 1960s spy music so rousingly one could mistake it for a lost John Barry Bond soundtrack.<br /><br />Barring a minor slow patch three-quarters into the movie when we slack off to discover the normal lives of our heroes, this is a gut-busting, heartwarming tale, as perfect a family film as any in the last decade. Must-own DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>Well, Pixar has raised the bar again.<br /><br />I dragged my younger daughter to see this, and although she enjoyed it, I enjoyed it more. If you didn't grow up reading comic books, you'll think this one is much ado about nothing. But if you still have a box of Marvel comics stashed away somewhere ('in your heart' will do), you'll love this film. Kids will like it too, but don't mistake it for a 'children's film' just because it's animated and has superheroes in it.<br /><br />The eye-popping animation is Pixar's finest to date, and that's saying a lot. The voice characterizations are consistent and believable throughout as well, especially (but not only) Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />The storyline is wildly, exuberantly inventive. There's lots of gentle spoofing of comic-book conventions, but it never descends into mockery; this film takes itself seriously, plays by its own rules, and delivers a surprisingly powerful story within those rules. Writer/director Brad Bird (of _Iron Giant_ fame) is obviously familiar with superhero comics in a way that only someone who loves them can be. (And the script passes the sternest test: it would have made a fine live-action movie too. In its way it's every bit as good as the _X-Men_ films.)<br /><br />The family's superpowers are, at a literal level, lifted directly from the comic-superhero world. But Bird puts them to sly metaphorical use as well, invoking well-known 'familial' archetypes: the super-strong dad, the pulled-every-which-way mom, the hyperkinetic little boy, the teenage daughter who turns invisible and isn't yet very good at putting up shields. Adults will enjoy this stuff if they notice it, but it's handled in such a way that everybody (including kids) will grok it intuitively whether they're consciously aware of it or not.<br /><br />The film doesn't moralize or preach, but its universe is one in which good and evil matter. To the extent that it has a moral, it's healthily individualistic and even anti-egalitarian; for example, the villain is motivated primarily by soul-deforming envy and resentment (and quite needlessly, since his own talents are clearly remarkable even though they're not superpowers). It shows genuine teamwork in action and doesn't confuse it with conformity or collectivism. It suggests very strongly that there's something wrong with refraining from displaying and using one's gifts just because not all other people share them. It illustrates that when heroes aren't permitted, the result is mediocrity.<br /><br />It may even stimulate older viewers to ask ourselves what _our_ special powers might be and whether _we've_ stopped exercising them (and if so, why); are we sure _our_ glory days are really over? Why, in short, did we put those comic books away? Have we forgotten why we liked them?<br /><br />You don't need me to tell you the plot; the other reviews have already done that. If you have an ounce of comicbookery in your soul, you'll love this grand, rollicking homage to the genre. See this one in the theater and _then_ buy it on DVD. Trust me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Most superheroes don't like to throw it in our faces, but -- accept it -- they are better than us.  Way better.  Brad Bird, the writer-director-voice behind The Incredibles, isn't shy about this quiet truth.  In fact, Bird even dares to suggest -- Heavens! -- that maybe even without superheroes, some of us are more equal ... okay, better -- than others.  So the heroes in The Incredibles have two kinds of enemies -- supervillains and a society that wants nothing more than to make everyone equal (and therefore equally mediocre).  Who leads the fight for mediocrity?  Liberal lawyers, of course ... those insidious creeps who not only want to turn basic human emotions and conflicts into money, but are hell-bent on [...] concepts of legal equality into factual equality.<br /><br />Yes, boys and girls, The Incredibles actually stands for something that ought not be controversial, but is.  If you want your kids to go on believing that people are all the same, watch out!  This movie might quietly burst that silly illusion.<br /><br />It's also a darn good movie -- more of James Bond, than of Toy Story, full of action, explosions, and peril.  The dialogue is crisp, and there are no ridiculous fart jokes.  This isn't Shrek.  The folks at Pixar are too intelligent to aim that low.<br /><br />This film is a vast improvement over the so-so Finding Nemo, and is every bit as good as A Bug's Life and Toy Story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>In the vein of Mystery Men and Unbreakable, the Incredibles is about modern sensibilities applied to standard superhero tropes.  In this case, it's the golden age of superheroes in the 1950s.  The timing is critical, because the government informally backs the superheroes and attitudes shifted in the 60s to skepticism and outright distrust of Big Brother. Several things happen at once as the plot is set up: Mr. Incredible (voice with kindness and strength by Craig T. Nelson) repeatedly rebuffs the preteen president of his fan club (Buddy Pine, voiced to perfection by Jason Lee), makes a date with his wife-to-be (Elastigirl, voiced by Holly Hunter's soft Midwestern purr), and saves a man who was trying to commit suicide.<br /><br />All in a day's work, right?<br /><br />Well, times change on the superheroes, but they don't change with them.  The person he saved sues Mr. Incredible.  The insanity of a man trying to commit suicide by plunging to his death and then suing a person who saved him from himself is an apt parallel for the madness of frivolous lawsuits. Soon, every superhero is being sued and the general populace doesn't WANT to be saved anymore.<br /><br />So the government packs them all off to relocation programs, and suddenly the superhero personas are inversed.  Their daily personalities are the masks they wear at work, while their superhero personalities are unspoken, dark secrets.<br /><br />Fast forward to years later (late 60s maybe?). Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl now have three children: Violet (Sarah Vowell), a teen with the power of invisibility and force fields, Dash (Spencer Fox), a precocious preteen who can run at lightning speed, and the baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile) who...doesn't have any powers.<br /><br />The family exhibits all the behavior of a normal American family - or at least, the normal family we wish we all had.  Mr. Incredible, as Bob Parr, is frustrated by his insurance job and the inability to actually help people.  As a superhero he seemed larger than life; as a working slob, he literally bursts from his tiny cube and can barely fit in his stuttering car.  And of course, he has an irritating speck of a boss named Gilbert Huph (a character Wallace Shawn voices to irritating perfection) who harasses Bob at every turn for helping customers, not shareholders.<br /><br />Bob's wife, Helen Parr/Elastigirl, has a different set of problems.  She struggles to help her incredible children blend in a mediocre world. Dash acts out because he can't join any sports.  Violet struggles to be noticed but hides in plain sight behind her hair.  And of course, the two of them fight like crazy.<br /><br />And thus Pixar has perfectly captured the American family tropes.  How many parents have boys who they just wish would tire out?  How many teenage girls wish they were invisible? What mother hasn't felt stretched in all directions? And every cubicle dweller (guilty as charged!) finds a Matrix-like connection with Bob, trapped by the most diabolical villain of all: real life.<br /><br />Bob hangs out with his buddy, the very cool Lucius Best, AKA Frozone (Samuel Jackson) in a role as an African-American hero who has also been retired. The contrast between this role and Jackson as villain in Untouchables should amuse fans of both films.  In the evenings, these two guys lie to their wives and go fight crime.  It's the only thing that makes them feel alive.<br /><br />Eventually, Bob's flirt with the dangerous life comes to a climax when he's finally had enough of his job.  He takes on freelance work and finds a new zest for life.  He loses weight, he starts wearing suits to work, he buys a new car, and he keeps Ms. Parr very happy.  In other words, Bob acts like he's having an affair.<br /><br />And in some sense he is.  Mr. Incredible is doing what makes him feel young again.  That there does happen to be a beautiful woman (Mirage, voiced by Elizabeth Pena) who lures him into that lifestyle only makes the indiscretion all the more riveting.  When Bob disappears on one of his missions, it's up to the family to rescue him.<br /><br />Throughout, there are a variety of threads that tweak the superhero genre. Edna Mode, voiced by Brad Bird, is the Dr. Ruth of superhero fashion designers. She repeatedly demonstrates the liabilities of wearing a cloak and opines about the challenges of crafting a superhero's costume.  Superheroes are disappearing, literally, for reasons that become apparent later.  And the government gets tired of keeping their heroes quiet.  Indeed, there's a hint of Vietnam in the ambivalent relationship between the former superheroes and their keepers.<br /><br />What's amazing about this film is the depth of the characters.  By now it's expected that each animated personality will perfectly embody the mannerisms of the actors who play them.  Syndrome is a masterful interpretation of the actor who voices him, with every mannerism and sideways glance.  Only James Woods' Hades in Disney's Hercules comes close.  Elastigirl manages to come across as strong, vulnerable, protective, fiery, and even playfully kittenish - Hunter has her down pat.  Elastigirl, a stay at home mom mind you, has made such an impression that there are several threads discussing her on the Internet.  No seriously, go check and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Equally as important is the relationship between the characters.  Elastigirl inadvertently flies her children into danger and then desperately struggles to keep them alive and calm.  Violet worries about being grown up enough while Dash freaks out over - and then just as quickly embraces - fighting bad guys who want to kill them.  Mr. Incredible's mettle is repeatedly tested and by overcoming each challenge we understand that he is a genuinely good, if frustrated, father and husband.<br /><br />All throughout, the movie never stops taking itself seriously. Elastigirl tells her children to use their powers to save themselves and that the bad guys WILL kill them.  Bad guys do not conveniently hop out of their aircraft, but rather go up in flames.  That's right, they die. And there is a lot of tension (the good kind) between Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, early in their relationship and even years later.  They love each other, like each other, and sometimes piss each other off, just like a married couple.<br /><br />The part that made me laugh out loud the most involved Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, arguing over directions as they drive a battered RV through city streets on the way to battle a super menace. The kids whine "are we there yet?" Elastigirl shouts, "take the exit!" Mr. Incredible shouts that he thinks he knows a faster way.  And for a brief second, despite the fact that the entire family is wearing bright red costumes and possesses superpowers, we understand that this is YOUR family, shouting, arguing, and loving each other.<br /><br />With the advent of The Incredibles, it has become apparent that the last haven of quality filmmaking is to be found not in cable television, but in animation.  Pixar consistently creates compelling stories that teach as well as entertain. Whether it's the joys and fears of fatherhood ("Finding Nemo"), the fear of children outgrowing their parents ("Toy Story"), or the pressures of being a creative person in a regimented world ("A Bug's Life"), Pixar has consistently demonstrated that they understand our greatest hopes and our worst fears.  The Incredibles is Pixar at the top of their game and should not be missed by anyone who loves superheroes...or has a family.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>Like a kid in the movie cries out to Mr. Incredible, as he lifts a car in the air, that's how I felt about the latest movie from Pixar: "Totally wicked!!" (or for those over 15, "Totally cool!")<br /><br />After five consecutive hits, it's tough to imagine how the animation and storytelling superpower could outdo themselves, but they pulled it off! With a retro feel and a blend of humor and James Bond-style action, comes 2004's most anticipated new animated movie. From the first frame to the closing titles, "The Incredibles" balances incredible animation with a fun and touching story that has something for everyone.<br /><br />Without a dull moment, the movie captures your imagination and makes the life of the Parr superhero family seem as real as yours or mine, as they very much face the same ailments and challenges that we encounter in the way. Big bellies and tight clothes, a frustrating job, an annoying boss: who hasn't faced some of these (maybe all) at some point? This makes it tough not to relate to Mr. Parr and his family of superheroes, confined to living a "normal" life after an ungrateful society and a host of lawsuits put his kind under public scrutiny and forced him out of his 'sexy' role, in charge of saving the world.<br /><br />Animation highlights almost top the story, making the characters more than believable. Shots of the characters floating in the sea, perfectly looking low-lit scenes and even a rescue scene in the midst of a fire are only some examples of the type of technical work you are up against. And it's all so natural, they make it seem easy!<br /><br />The truth is that there's nothing easy about putting together such a solid movie. A story that makes you think and laugh, and a technical achievement that is bound to become another classic. In short, "totally wicked!" Pixar, once again, has gone beyond infinity!</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already said. Animation is great, lines are funny, characters are nicely developed, story's well-written. Definitely one of Disney's better films, and worthy of a five-star rating. Seriously. Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>A truly enjoyable movie for anyone who ever enjoyed comic books.<br /><br />I think this is without a doubt the best animated film to take on the task of taking the comic book hero genre into a movie. Numerous touches, small and large, bring back the atmosphere we always imagined as kids.<br /><br />Additionally, this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy together. The scary scenes are tolerable for young kids and don't last overly long. There is plenty of comedy for adults, and enough 'cool factor' for everyone. You'll come to care about the family of Incredibles with their challenges and problems, and revel in the clever ways the writers have the family, and their super powers, come together.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful to behold.<br /><br />I just watched it again recently, and enjoyed it every bit as much as when I first watched it when it came out.</p></br><a href="../users/A38ZTUNQJVGP6S.html">A38ZTUNQJVGP6S</a><br/><p>The Incredibles is one hour and fifty-five minutes and was released in theaters on November 5, 2004. The Incredibles tells the story of Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) who in his heyday belong to a group of super heroes who belong to the NSA (National Supers Agency). After he saves a man life and the lives of people on a train, people begin suing Mr. Incredible and later on other supers. The supers are forced into retirement and to lead normal lives. It is fifteen years later and Bob and Helen (his wife and former Elastigirl) have three kids and Bob works as works at Insuricare where helps client find loopholes in their claims if they are turned down. This is a job that Bob does not like and hates his boss even worse because he is heartless and only cares about making a profit. Bob winds up getting fired because he threw Gilbert Huph (his boss) through five walls because he would not let Bob prevent a person getting mugged and when the person is mugged Mr. Huph mocks the victims. Bob is now home and unemployed again and has not told his wife about what happened at work. While going through is briefcase he discovers an envelop and opens it up and there is a message like the one seen in the opening scene in the Mission Impossible TV show; even exploding ten seconds after it is played and causing the house water sprinkling system to go off. There is a message from a person who call herself Mirage and offers Mr. Incredible a job and that would pay him three times his yearly salary. Bob accepts the offer and heads to the island to destroy the Omnidroid. Mr. Incredible is out of shape and his back seems to out on him at times when he is fighting the Omnidroid; in the end Mr. Incredible defeats the Omnidroid. While Bob is waiting for his next assignment, he works out in a train while Helen is thinking he is at work. Also Bob is getting reconnected with his family and is no longer miserable. One day Bob visits Edna Mode to have his original super suit mended. Edna wants to make Bob a new suit and throw away the old one claiming she does not look back. Edna agrees to repair the old suit while at the same time making Bob a new suit. Mr. Incredible is called back to the island for a new assignment and finds out that new Omnidroid that has been update is ready to take on Mr. Incredible. It is during this fight with the machine that Syndrome is controlling the machine. Syndrome at one time was Incredi-Boy for a few brief minutes of his life. Buddy Pine, Incredi-Boy, wanted to be Mr. Incredible sidekick but told Buddy to go home because he worked alone. Syndrome uses the Omnidroid and his zero-point technology to toss Mr. Incredible around. It is with his zero-point technology that Syndrome tosses Mr. Incredible too far and accidently let him escapes. Mr. Incredible is able to save himself by swimming into a cave and hiding behind the dead skeleton of Gazerbeam. Mr. Incredible is able to sneak back into the cave and finds the information about the other Supers who have been killed by earlier models of the Omnidroid and only Elastigirl and Frozone are the only two who remain alive. Meanwhile Helen visits Edna who believes know something about Bob whereabouts. Edna thinks that Helen is here to get the new Super suits she has made for the family. While at Edna's place, Helen finds out the Bob has not been working at Insuricare the last two months and thinks he is cheating on her. Edna tells Helen to fight for her husband and go and get him. Helen charters a plane to find Bob and does not know that Dash and Violet have sneaked aboard. Back at the island Mr. Incredible has been caught when his homing signal went off; a device he did not know he had. Mr. Incredible is now a prisoner of Syndrome and Syndrome begins to torture him. He wants to know how is on the plane and makes Mr. Incredible listen to a radio transmission. Mr. Incredible recognizes the voice of Helen but does not tell Syndrome about his relationship to her. Syndrome sends out heat seeking missiles to destroy the jet and succeeds in doing so. Unknown to Syndrome and Mr. Incredible, Helen, Violet, and Dash all survive the plain wreck and make it to the island. Helen leaves the children in a cave and goes to look for Bob. She finds Bob and the two make a break from the cave and eventually hook up with their children. Syndrome is able to recapture them and is surprised to learn the Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are married and got busy, my favorite line in the movie even if I did quote it correctly. Violet is able to use her force field powers and is able to free the family. The Incredibles with the assistant of Mirage fly a rocket back to Metroville where the Omnidroid is set loose of the city and Syndrome tries to destroy his own machine but is knocked unconscious in the fight. The Incredibles and Frozone fight to destroy the Omnidroid and are successful in doing so. Syndrome is enraged and heads to the home of Parrs. Syndrome kidnaps Jack-Jack and flies out of the house with him. Jack-Jack is scared and begins to turn into a ball of fire, lead weight, and a devilish creature. This causes Syndrome to drop Jack-Jack and Elastigirl rescues her son. Mr. Incredible throws his new car at Syndrome which causes his cape to get caught in one of his jet engines and that blows up the plane and kills Syndrome. The Incredibles is the first Pixar movie to have human only in it. Also the computer animation is great too. The Incredibles gets an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />Introduction<br />Play Movie<br />Commentaries<br />A) Brad Bird & John Walker<br />B) Animator<br />Sneak Peeks<br />A) Cars<br />B) Chicken Little<br />C) Cinderella<br />D) Miyazaki<br />E) Lilo & Stitch 2<br />F) The Incredibles Video Game<br />G) The Twilight Zone: Tower of Terror<br />Set Up<br />Index<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />Introduction<br />Jack-Jack Attack<br />Deleted Scenes<br />Behind the Scenes<br />A) Making of the Incredibles<br />B) More Making of the Incredibles<br />C) Incredi-Blunders<br />D) Vowellett-An Essay by Sarah Vowell<br />E) Art Gallery<br />F) Publicity<br />Top Secret<br />A) Mr. Incredible & Pals<br />B) Commentary By Mr. Incredible & Frozone<br />C) Super Files<br />Boundin'<br />A) Commentary<br />B) Who is Bud Luckey?<br />Set Up<br />Index</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this is a great movie. disney & pixar don't go wrong. this movie is awesome i love this movie. the incredibles is about a dysfunctinal superhero family who been kicked out of society for saving someone's life who didn't want saved. now mr. incredible is on a mission to regain pepoles faith in superheros. i recommend this movie for eveyone</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Once one of the world's top masked crimefighters, Bob Parr--known to all as "Mr. Incredible"--fought evil and saved lives on a daily basis. But now fifteen years later, Bob and his wife--a famous superhero in her own right--have adopted civilian identities and retreated to the suburbs to live normal lives with their three kids. Now he's a clock-punching insurance claims adjuster fighting boredom and a bulging waistline. Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secretassignment. This movie is a class act and a lot of fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This is a 2004 computer animated film produced by Pixar and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.<br /><br />I was more than delighted with this movie.  It is a movie that all ages will find incredibly entertaining! It has a terrific story filled with comedy and thrills to keep everyone happy and engaged. The animated characters are unique, smart and fun to watch.  Pixar does an over-the-top job (as usual) with animation and design backgrounds.<br /><br />The movie starts with the marriage of the Parr's.  Because of rescue gone wrong and lawsuits, the government orders the Parr's to establish new identities and live a normal life as an average family in the suburbs. The Incredibles are the Parr Family- Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet and baby Jack-Jack.  Each have their own unique incredible super powers.  Bob Parr, who was "Mr. Incredible" misses his former super hero life and works at night with a former super hero friend, Lucias Best - known as "Frozone".  They sneak off at night to fight petty crimes.<br /><br />A mysterious woman, "Mirage" contacts Bob to offer him a job as Mr. Incredible to stop a rogue robot "Onmidroid 9000" on a distant island for a large amount of money.  Bob has lost his boring insurance job and not told Helen, his wife, so agrees to the deal.  He has to get back in shape and get a new super hero costume.  The costume designer, Edna, is a hoot.  One of the well-developed wacky characters that you immediately smile at.  Bob goes to the Island and is able to stop the first Onmidroid 9000.  He is paid a handsome sum of money and returns home to buy new cars, and presents for his family.  He is soon asked to return to the island for another job.<br /><br />Helen becomes suspicious of Bob's activities.  She sees a suit repair and knows that he has visited Edna, a top notch designer.  When talking to Edna she finds that Edna not only created Bob's new suit, she has created a new suit for each member of the Parr family.  Each has a homing device.  Helen uses this to find Bob's location and, as a licensed pilot, gets a jet to find Bob.  Dash (the speedy son) and Violet (able to be invisible) stow away on the plane.  They crash near the island and Helen uses her stretch super power and Dash's speed to land on the island.<br /><br />Syndrome is the evil one - he has always wanted to get even with Bob from his hero days. He is on the island with his assistant, Mirage.  He wants to get even with Bob from past slights.  Bob is captured by Syndrome with Mirage's help and is angry to find out through their security devices that his famiy is on the island and at risk.  From here there are many close escapes and adventures as a family.  Mirage turns on her boss, Syndrome, and helps the Parrs to escape and catch up with the Omnidroid heading for Metroville.  It is damaging the city with its ability to learn and fight opponents.  Assisted by Frozone the Parrs get the remote control and destroy the Omnidorid.<br /><br />When they return home, Syndrome has discovered the Parr's identity.  He is attempting kidnap the baby, Jack-Jack, and raise him to become his sidekick.  As Syndrom leaves to get on his jet, Jack-Jack realizes he can shape himself in a number of bizarre forms that cause Syndrome to drop him.  Bob throws Helen into the air to catch Jack-Jack - then throws his car at Syndromes jet, whcih causes Syndromes cape to get caught in one of his jet engines, dragging him to death.<br /><br />The Parrs' resume their normal life.  Then the city is threatened by a new villain called "The Underminer"...  Does this mean a sequel?<br /><br />Anyway, an excellent movie in all categories.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>Although it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature (2004), am I the only one who wishes it were in the regular "Best Picture" category?<br /><br />I also think this is a better movie for adults than it is for kids. That speaks not only to the violence, but the depth of story and the historical precedents as well (recalling the classic era of comic books, then fast forwarding to a sue-happy society). The pathos, too, would be lost on most young children.<br /><br />Much better than Finding Nemo or Cars, this is up there with Toy Story 2 as one of Pixar's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The Incredibles isn't quite as perfect as everyone would lead you to believe (for one, the middle section of the movie drags a bit) but it's fun, smart, well-animated, and fresh; probably the best Pixar release that's not a Toy Story, it's worth watching and owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is well worth getting, especially if you can pick it up cheap.<br />The film itself is great for people of all ages. However, as it says on the DVD case if the kids are very small you might wish to watch it with them the first time.<br /><br />Theres much for adults to enjoy here, including some perceptive stuff about work place frustration, which Mr Incredible fails to keep under control! The family scenes will also remind adults of the joys and the difficulties of running a family household. Like a lot of modern digital animations this film works on different levels for different people. The kids on the other-hand will love the superhero fights and the exciting set-piece battles.<br /><br />I haven't watched the extras yet but they look interesting and combined with the main film will give you hours and hours of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Imagine we lived in a world where superheroes actually existed. What would that world be like? It would probably be pretty nice. But what if something happened, an accident of some sort that was inadvertently caused by these same heroes that put many in jeopardy, and maybe even cost innocent lives. Would we shun these heroes who had saved our lives countless other times over one incident when fate didn't go our way? Well, that's probably what would happen given the state of our society, and is exactly what happens in Disney/Pixar's computer animated hit movie "The Incredibles".<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is about a family of heroes who find themselves trying to fit into normal everyday life, after the government was forced to put them into a sort of witness protection program designed for those with extraordinary abilities. Bob Parr (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter) are doing their best to raise their anything but normal family and stay out of the media spotlight. Their oldest child Violet, is a somewhat depressed, introverted young girl who possesses the ability to become invisible, which she does whenever a cute boy is around. The middle child, Dash, is the exact opposite of his sister, as he is a hyperactive kid who definitely lives up to his name with his ability of super-speed. Then there's Jack-Jack, the baby, his power is to drool on everything and look cute. Living the life of a normal person doesn't set too well with Bob though, as he is constantly drawn to the glory days, when heroes were honored by the people and depended upon to right the wrongs. So when a mysterious offer is made that could give Bob the excuse he needs to use his powers again, he of course leaps at the opportunity, but what he soon discovers is that often times if the offer is too good to be true, then it probably is. Now, Bob finds himself in a fight for not only his life, but also that of his family and friends in the hidden superhero community.<br /><br />Just when I thought that Pixar couldn't possibly do any better than their classics, "Finding Nemo" and "Toy Story", those creative gurus go and deliver what is quite possibly their best film to date. Now, I'll admit I may be a bit more biased towards this movie since it is a superhero themed movie, a subject matter that I enjoy due to my interest in comic books and their movie adaptations, but aside from that I believe that this is a truly well put together piece of cinema that the entire family can sit back and enjoy on multiple levels. That's the glorious thing about Pixar films, is that they actually strive to contain a little something for everyone to enjoy. For instance, in this movie their is thrilling action sequences (for the action buffs), family drama (for the dramatic types), a little romance (for you mushy people out there), and of course, comedy (which is where the movie truly shines by having comedy that hits all sorts of age ranges).<br /><br />The story for "The Incredibles" is a perfect superhero tale that is so well-developed that it can easily go toe-to-toe with it's live action counterparts, even besting some of them. It was an interesting approach to take by having the world go from essentially worshiping these heroes to shunning them the instant things didn't go smoothly, to turning back around and needing them again. Even though it was an animated movie full of comedy and adventure, the story is actually one that would probably be fairly true to life if this was to all take place in the real world. Which shows the depth that the creative teams at Pixar are willing to take their movies to in order to achieve the most entertaining experience possible for audiences. One final note regarding the story for "The Incredibles" is that this is the type of storytelling that I wish Marvel and 20th Century Fox would have taken with their film "Fantastic Four". Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed that movie as well, as my review stated, but I would have preferred a little more serious tone in the film. Which is why "The Incredibles" was a little bit better of a movie, in my opinion.<br /><br />Another outstanding feature for most Pixar movies is their terrific vocal performances from all of their actors. A key component to making any successful animated movie is to have the best actors possible to bring these 2-D or 3-D characters to life. It's something that Disney has always strived for, and it's nice to see that Pixar is carrying on the tradition in order to continue making excellent family-friendly films. The voice actors gathered together for this film all turn in fun, engaging performances bringing each of their characters to life, in such a realistic way that balances perfectly with the beautifully rendered computer generated imagery. Which brings me to my final praise of the movie, the animation. As always the folks at Pixar deliver another awesome looking 3-D animated film that features CGI that rivals even the biggest live action blockbuster film.<br /><br />All of these factors combined together are the prime examples for why Pixar remains the best of the best in animated films of any kind, and their hit film "The Incredibles" is no exception.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is rated PG for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I must confess i loved this movie, it is very well conceived.  The computer animation is amazing and the dialogue is very funny.  I laughed my a** off at the Edith Head character, it was genius to channel her for this movie, she was the beginning and the end for movie fashion in her time.  This movie represents one of the rare instances when adults will enjoy a kids movie at least as much if not more than the children it is intended for.  Highly recommended on so many levels.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>"Things exploding, people hugging."  That's what composer Michael Ciacchino said the score was about for "The Incredibles".  Director Brad Bird echoed that, saying it was aimed at being a balance of the mundane and the fantastic.  It did a fantastic job at that.<br /><br />This was the first Pixar picture I watched, and I can see why people rave about their animation.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  I will admit that I found it interesting the similarity between the foursome and the Fantastic Four (one stretches, one is super-strong, and one is invisible with force fields in both quartets).  I also think it stretched reality a little -- I can imagine the son of a superman type inheriting super-speed, but there is no explanation why a super strong parent and an elastic parent could produce a daughter who turns invisible and throws force fields.  Likewise, if superheroes were out-lawed, what could keep evil supers from running wild?  But when did facts stand in the way of a good story?<br /><br />The story was very entertaining.  It dealt with adult themes in a way that children wouldn't be bored or question something inappropriate.  The writing was great to show human people who just happened to have powers.  It made a great jab at bureauracy being no better than criminals.<br /><br />Also, I enjoyed the James Bond-ish music.  The characters were great as well.<br /><br />Spoiler alert!!!  The rest of this review may ruin some surprises -- read at your own risk!  Also, some of this is my opinion of life in general.<br /><br />The villain, Syndrome, when he was younger, had wanted to be the sidekick for Mr. Incredible, who told him to get lost, that he could handle things on his own.  So Syndrome's plan was to sell superpowers to everyone, and commented "When everybody is super, nobody is super."  Actually, that is the reality.  In a sense, each of us are super, so nobody is better than anyone else.  (My thoughts here.)<br /><br />There is a theme that we are not meant to go about it alone.  If Mr. Incredible has decided to work with "Indrediboy", maybe there would never have been a Syndrome.  In the end, Mr. Incredible learned he was meant to be part of a team, and that team was his family.  We need to realize that this is true of us as well.<br /><br />The alternate beginning drove home the family point.  I think they did the better opening, but I wish they were able to do as the alternate beginning did, and have Helen tell some career woman who looked down on home mothers  the fact that one is no less important than the other.<br /><br />I enjoyed the extra features.  I would have moved the Incrediblunders up on the menu, because a lot of them were shown in the making of the Incredibles.  I was disappointed there was little shown about the voice-actors.  I did find the "essay" by Sarah Vowell (who provided the voice for Violet) intersting, since Vowell and I share interest in the Garfield and McKinley administrations, though I think she would benefit from Toastmasters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Incredibles (Widescreen 2-Disc Collector's Edition)~ Maeve Andrews is a really good animated movie. The animation is astounding and the script is very well written. The movie starts out with Mr Incredible saving the world and then he is sued by the people that he tried to save. This means that the Incredibles are put under witness protection act so that they can live "normal" lives. I love the music and it reminds me a lot of the music used for movies such as Superman, Batman and other super hero movies. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie, like the scene with the "fat" Mr. incredible not fitting in the tube, the fight with the robot and many more.  This is the best animated movie that I have seen since Finding Nemo and I therefore give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>You know what when this came out in threaters i didn't want to see it it didn't really look apealing to me even after my family said it was good, so after so much time has went by and i saw it on dvd i must admit that it was good, i guess i didn't know what i was missing because i can honestly say i was entertain...<br /><br />............FAMILY FUN................</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"The Incredibles" is a movie that adults will enjoy as much as kids. Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) was a famous superhero until a bunch of people started filing lawsuits against the superheroes who saved them. Together with his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Mr. Incredible enters a sort of superhero witness protection program. The couple assume new identities, Bob and Helen Parr, and raise their three children (two of whom also have superpower tendencies) in anonymity for the next 15 years. Bob is miserable in his job as an insurance claims specialist, so when a mysterious informant offers him the chance to play hero again, he jumps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the whole thing turns out to be a trap that was orchestrated by a superhero wannabe that Mr. Incredible angered many years ago. Mr. Incredible/Bob soon finds himself in the middle of a very sticky situation, and his wife and children have to return to their superhero roots in order to save the day.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this movie. It's very funny and original, and all of the characters are fantastic. In addition to the Incredibles, there's Bob's best friend Lucius Best, the former superhero Frozone, who is voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. ("Woman, where is my super suit?!") My favorite character is a quirky little woman with big glasses named Edna Mode who designs superhero outfits. Every word out of her mouth is HILARIOUS! ("Yes, words are useless! Gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble!")<br /><br />This film has a PG rating. Unlike most animated films, there's a lot of shooting and people dying in "The Incredibles." I don't think it's excessive at all and it's certainly tamer than most of the stuff kids watch on television these days, but some overly-sensitive parents might have a problem with it.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this movie. It was much better than I thought it would be because it's not a typical animated film...in some respects, I think adults will actually get much more out of it than kids. "The Incredibles" is a fun movie that also stresses the importance of family and teamwork. Parents will enjoy watching this movie with their kids and adults who don't have kids will enjoy it, too!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong, the animation is great, but it's no better than Finding Nemo or Shrek. But what makes this animated feature stand out above others is that the storyline has finally got...uh...humanized. No talking animals, no life-like inanimate objects, just ordinary family problems as seen through the eyes of a family that's anything but ordinary.<br /><br />They're (should I say it?) Incredible.<br /><br />Gone are the talking fish and donkey, replaced by superhumans with superproblems; after devastating litigious events strike the superheroes, they go into hiding with the aid of our government. But some of them just can't let go. Enter Mr. Incredible and his family (Elastigirl, his wife, and their special children). Mr Incredible listens to the police scanner, hoping that something bad will happen nearby, thus allowing him to sneak in and thwart a robbery or save victims from a burning building.<br /><br />Life, as an ordinary human, is killing Mr. Incredible slowly. So when an offer comes in to eliminate a menacing robot on a distant island, Mr. Incredible sneaks off to do the good deed. But it's a trap, and now his family (who've been in hiding all this time, trying to be the typical nuclear family) must "dash" to his rescue. The dysfunction is palpable as the brother and sister constantly quibble, Mother has to keep them separate and keep their powers under control, and Dad (Mr. Incredible) has to try and save his family from a dastardly villain.<br /><br />This was a truly enjoyable story for an animated film; it has characters approaching depression, while others worry about marital infidelity. Quite unusual for a high-tech "cartoon".</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"The Incredibles" is another digitally animated hit from Pixar Studios.

It's one of the more clever movies of 2004.<br /><br />Suppose there was a superhero and his female counterpoint. They race around and do good. What would happen in America, the movie asks? They'd be sued as a consequence of their lawbreaking. They'd be retired.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, who have married, are retired by law and sent into a relocation program. There they take mundane jobs and sire three kids. But you can't keep superheroes down.

"The Incredibles" manages to dance the line between all demographics and comes across as the perfect mixture of young and old wrapped into one.  It has slapstick, silly humor for the very young, it has adventure and suspense that will knock the socks off of older children and young teens, and it has a brilliant storyline that pulls in the older audience.<br /><br />We've all wanted to be great at sometime in our lives.  Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl, are given that chance.  But thanks to a few snakey lawyers and their lawsuits, our heroes are driven into a sort of witness protection program for superheroes.  Unable to deny his need to protect the innocent, Mr. Incredible, along with fellow ex-superhero, Frozone, secretly helps out those who are in need of a hero.  Of course, this all leads to a trap that is set by Mr. Incredible's arch-nemesis, Syndrome.  What follows is a family adventure that encompasses all age groups.<br /><br />My daughter, who is three, was scared a little when the Incredible children are chased by a few mechanical monstrosities.  What amazes me is that she loves to watch the ogres in the "Lord of the Rings" films and they don't phase her one bit.  All I can come up with is that she is scared because other children are in harm's way.  Anyway, there is no foul language or themes that will drive away viewers.  Everything is fairly safe, but it holds your attention the entire time.  Folks with meek or quiet children who scare easily may want to preview this one before letting the really young'uns watch this, but I don't think there is too much contained herein to offend.<br /><br />Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee master the attitude, style, and charisma of their respective characters.  It's amazing how Pixar can manage to take actors and actresses whose stars aren't quite as bright as many others and crank out a great movie.  They have restored my faith in REAL actors.<br /><br />The action is fast-paced and fun to watch.  If you like the action in "Spider-Man" or "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," you will not be upset.  The whole film has that "comic-come-to-life" feel about it.  There is suspense, drama, and some sweet moments as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I'd give it five stars, but the only detraction I have is that the movie does run quite long.  That's not a good thing if your three year-old is the type who can only handle about an one-and-a-half hours of "sitting quiet" time.  If you don't have kids, consider this a five star flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Pixar lords over the realm of animation; they own it, and all others are pretenders to their throne.<br /><br />The characters aren't the most original: at best, they are archetypes (if comic books have been around long enough to have archetypes) of well established superheroes. Mr. Incredible is Batman without the dark side, Elastagirl is, interestingly enough, Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four (a movie coming to our theaters in 2005). The older son is obviously the Flash, and the teenage girl is an amalgam of several characters, both comic and non-comic. But archetype does not mean stereotype. These characters are all freshly represented.<br /><br />For example, instead of having a dark side like his inspiration, Batman, Mr. Incredible has a self-doubting side. And he marries a superhero, creating a family. Another (mostly) unique representation.<br /><br />It would be easy to disect this film into even smaller parts, draw more parallels, but I think that would be doing the film a disservice. Sure, it had inspiration from other comics, but the way it was written, drawn, directed, voiced - everything - made it wholly its own. This is a movie that everyone will love (and the box office is evidencing that), from kids to adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>The Incredibles tells a terrific story, which follows the lives of fallen hero's always itching to get back in the action.<br /><br />I went in to the theatre expecting a few laughs, but also carried in a little grain of salt. It would be so easy for Pixar and Disney to take a mis-step and release a quick money grabbing kid charmer, but fortunately my mind was quickly set to ease. The action, the imagination, and the downright quirkiness of the incredibles makes it a near perfect, ambitious flick.<br /><br />The animators must have been going nuts through production. The details are astounding, and even with all their strength's the hero's retain a sincere, flawed humanity. Any other way, and it would have lost my vote.<br /><br />See the Incredibles, it's original, that in itself is a virtue.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>The Incredibles is one of the best superhero movies ever made.  Watching the surprisingly realistic computer animation, it raises the question, "Why don't we make ALL our superhero movies this way?"  Let's face it, the special effects in "live-action" films are just as computer-generated as these.  Watch the way Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) creates an ice-slide.  Will Iceman (of the X-Men) ever be able to do something similar in a live-action film.  The whole look of the film is terrific - capturing the feel, the architecture, and the look of golden-era comic books.  Personally, I usually find computer-generated humans to be a bit creepy, but this film is successful because it eschews realism in favor or caricature for its characters.<br /><br />The story is as funny as any animated feature I've seen: superheroes are forced to retire and adjust to civilian life.  Of course, that can't last forever and The Incredibles come out of hiding.  The funniest character turns out to be a fashion designer who answers the question, "Where do superheroes get their costumes from?"<br /><br />The film is much more grown-up than one would expect - especially about violence.  Elastigirl tells her children:  "You know those cartoons you used to watch on Saturday morning?  This isn't like that.  These people won't show restraint just because you are children - they will kill you if they get the chance."  It is because of the seriousness of some of the violence that this picture isn't suitable for the very little.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Brad Bird<br /><br />Pixar's sixth animated feature is something of a departure for the company.  It marks the first time they have brought in outside talent to direct a feature (Brad Bird, director of "The Iron Giant").  It marks the first time a Pixar film has been rated PG instead of G.  It also is the first time a Pixar film is completely about human characters.  Previously the humans in Pixar movies have been kept in supporting roles with the most prominent one being Boo in "Monsters Inc".  This time around, the humans are everywhere, so this was a new test of Pixar's talent.  Time will tell, but "The Incredibles" may just be Pixar's best movie.<br /><br />Imagine a world where there are superheroes battling to save the day.  They fight because they have superpowers and this is their job.  Mr. Incredible (Craig T Nelson) is the best, and most famous, of all the superheroes.  But when he is sued for saving the life of a man who didn't want to be saved, the floodgates of lawsuits opened up and the country decided that there is no need to have any more superheroes.  All superheroes are placed into the "Superhero Relocation Program", are granted amnesty for their past deeds, and now work regular, normal jobs.  Mr. Incredible and his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) are now simply Bob and Helen Parr.  They have two children, Violet (NPR's Sarah Vowell) and Dash (Spencer Fox) who have superpowers but are not permitted to use them in public.  Bob Parr works in insurance while Helen is a stay at home mother.  Their lives are mundane, but Bob cannot quite let go of the past.  He goes out on Wednesday nights for "bowling night".  But bowling night consists of him and his former superhero friend Frozone (Samuel L Jackson), think "Iceman", sitting in a parked car listening to the police scanner talking about the old days and waiting for a chance to illegally help someone.<br /><br />Bob Parr is contacted by Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), a superhero still doing superwork and she has a job for Mr. Incredible, if he is willing.  Dissatisfied with his life, Mr. Incredible comes out of retirement, but he doesn't tell his wife.  Suddenly he is making three times the money he was in insurance (before being fired from that job) and he has motivation to get back into shape.  Elastigirl suspects an affair, but it isn't long before Mr Incredible has disappeared, captured by super villain Syndrome (Jason Lee) who has had a long standing grudge with Mr. Incredible ever since he was a child.  Elastigirl, along with her children who secretly come along, have to rescue Mr. Incredible.<br /><br />This is a Pixar movie, so all of this is animated and since it is a Pixar movie, "The Icredibles" pushes the boundaries of what was thought possible in animation.  Simply put: this is a beautiful movie.  There is an exaggerated level of realism, but everything flows and moves perfectly.  This is, in part, a children's movie so "The Incredibles" is a lot of fun to watch.  There is fast paced action which will thrill the kids.  The movie is funny and flashy and bright.  At times it looks just like a Saturday morning cartoon, but if so, it is the best Saturday morning cartoon you are likely to ever see.  There is so much for adults in this movie to enjoy.  From the clever dialogue and discussion of superheroes and super-villains to jokes that will go over the head of children, "The Incredibles" has something for everyone.  There is action, comedy, adventure, fun, thrills, suspense, and danger.  The Pixar name (not to mention Brad Bird) has long been one for quality and Pixar does not disappoint with "The Incredibles".  This is easily one of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Everything about "The Incredibles" is incredible.  The<br /><br />new Pixar film just released this weekend is a preview<br /><br />of things to come from the animation annals of<br /><br />Hollywood.  If you were entertained by such "Pixar"<br /><br />flicks as "Monsters, Inc.", "Toy Story", "A Bug's<br /><br />Life" and "Finding Nemo", this one is better.<br /><br />Animation has reached new heights.  I really don't<br /><br />want to give away any of the plot, other than this<br /><br />film is so entertaining you will walk away feeling a<br /><br />part of the "Incredible" family.  The casting is<br /><br />superb with the voices of Holly Hunter, Samuel L.<br /><br />Jackson, and Craig T. Nelson.  The special effects<br /><br />will amaze you.  The humor is side-splitting.  The<br /><br />plot is ingenious...and the music and sound fit the<br /><br />script and editing to the tee.  This one is destined<br /><br />to be a classic.  Wanna just be entertained and enjoy<br /><br />a popcorn night out at the flicks (without the sex,<br /><br />violence, gore and decadence of today's genre')?.  Go<br /><br />see "The Incredibles".  It is truly a "feel good"<br /><br />movie.  No questions asked...a solid 5!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Incredibles" works on so many levels - it's both an adventure and a parody of adventures, with Pixar's famed animation being capable of seamlessly jumping from one extreme to the other, and bringing out the high-points in each.<br /><br />When "The Incredibles" opens, superheroes are already a commonplace occurrence.  Identities are secret, but heroes seem to keep them only for buying groceries, and remain perfectly at home when masked, flying and crime-fighting.  Unfortunately, the world is too comfy with heroes, and cavalierly finds itself needing their assistance.  When a spate of lawsuits proves too much for Mr. Incredible himself (Craig T. Nelson) to handle, he and other heroes are placed into a witness-protection program for ex-crime fighters.  Already married to Elasti-Girl (Holly Hunter) Mr. Incredible settles reluctantly into assumed suburban living (dead-end job working for an insurance company; ridiculous car; NO crime fighting), father's some kids and hangs up his suit.  Never forgetting his past glory days, or that they are in fact in his past, Incredible chomps at the bit for a chance to return.  He gets it when a mysterious beautiful woman offers him a ridiculous sum of money to help contain her latest invention - an agressive robot that, among other things, can learn from its mistakes and those of its enemies.  After a trip to the island of the robot's mysterious creator, Incredible learns a darker secret, one that will force him to enlist the aid of his wife and two of their three super-powered children.<br /><br />First off, does anybody remember the 80's comic "Watchmen"?  For those who have, the surprise is how much of that dark and mean-spirited comic novel has found its way into a fim that is completely unlike it in tone.  "Incredibles" is fun - though its loud and fast, and has some CGI relared viokence and may otheriwse scare some younger viewers (mine sat through the whole thing w/o problem).  With its Pixar-aniamted world, this is a story that can pick and choose when it will thrill or just go for the easy laugh.  Either way it goes, I cam out of this movie seeing something I hadn't seen in a while - a standing ovation.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>The Incredibles marks the first effort from the collaboration between Brad Bird (responsible for The Iron Giant) and Pixar. Where Warner Brothers had no idea how to market Bird's first film, Disney had no problem with promoting his new movie and it was a huge hit. The Incredibles is also the first Pixar film with human beings as the central characters, instead of relegated to the margins. Perhaps they were waiting for computer animation to progress enough to render them convincingly or maybe they were waiting for someone with the right vision to realize them. They found it with Bird who uses his cartoonish style of caricature to exaggerate a character's physical features and body gestures to make them more identifiable to the audience.<br /><br />As is typical with previous Pixar DVDs, The Incredibles is jam-packed with a wealth of extra material. All of the animated menus keep in flavour and tone with the look and feel of the movie, which is a really nice touch.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Brad Bird and producer John Walker. The two men constantly praise their hard-working crew for achieving the look and feel that they strove to achieve. Bird touches upon some of the film's themes and plot points in this engaging and informative track.<br /><br />There is a second commentary track by several of the film's animators. They talk about some of the techniques used in the movie. The strengths of caricature vs. realistic art are discussed and it is pointed out that caricature brings out the essence of a character.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "Jack-Jack Attack," an animated short film created specifically for the DVD that stars the Parr's baby. It shows us what happened between Jack-Jack and the babysitter while the Incredibles were off saving the world.<br /><br />There are six deleted scenes in various unfinished forms (often animated storyboards) that are individually introduced by Bird who puts each one into context and explains why it was cut. He does an excellent job talking about each scene.<br /><br />The "Behind the Scenes" section includes a detailed Making of Featurette (and a collection of additional footage) that shows how much time, energy and hard work went into making The Incredibles. This featurette covers all aspects, from story to character design to music and even the customary blooper reel.<br /><br />"Top Secret" features a "vintage" Mr. Incredible cartoon that is a spot-on parody of crudely animated cartoons from the `60s. Craig T. Nelson and Samuel L. Jackson even reprise their roles in a mock audio commentary trashing the cartoon! There are also beautifully designed profiles of all the costumed characters from the movie, even minor ones that are only briefly mentioned.<br /><br />"Boundin'" is the animated short film that appeared in front of The Incredibles when it debuted in theatres.<br /><br />The Incredibles continues Pixar's unprecedented streak of box office and critical successes. With each film they have further advanced the art of computer animation and this film is no different. However, Bird brings his own unique vision that separates his movie from the rest of Pixar's canon. It is a refreshing new perspective that features Bird's obsession with the `50s and superheroes. The Incredibles is a near perfect blend of populist sensibilities with an engaging and entertaining story that never condescends to children or alienates adults. Like other Pixar films it will endure because it appeals to people of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>An animated film with great visual and sound effects that actually has (gasp!) a sharp well-written script featuring real humanlike characters, a fairly creative storyline, and even something of a subtext buried underneath it all!<br /><br />I rented this film not expecting anything more than a quick 2 hours of fluffy entertainment and a workout for my home theater system, and am happy to report that all expectations were far surpassed!<br /><br />There are some great voice performances by some great actors: Samuel L. Jackson, Holly Hunter, Elizabeth Pena, etc.<br /><br />Much more of an "adult" film than I had ever dared to hope!  But would be plenty enjoyable for the kids as well, the theme of non-conformity is certainly educational.<br /><br />And lastly but not least, if you like to watch a lot of films like this a good home theater system with a capable subwoofer is a must...I feel sorry the folks who are stuck with their TV's onboard sound!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>It appears Pixar is physically incapable of makng a bad movie.  Only about a year after "Finding Nemo" broke banks around the world, the animated wunderkinds unfurl "The Incredibles," another leap in computer animation and another golden example of how moves should tell a story.  Writer and Director Brad Bird finally gets the hit he should have gotten with the classic "The Iron Giant," but "The Incredibles" is not just Bird saying about time, he shows the same care to the story of a family of superheros as he did to the one about the huge metal man.  At one time, superheros were everywhere, saving people using their impressive powers.  But once civil lawsuits are filed at one superhero after another by people claiming they did not want to be saved, the supers go into hiding as normal averages joes.  This eventually grates on one superhero in particular Mr Incredible/AKA Bob Par (Craig T. Nelson) who wants to get back in his tights even with kids (who have their own superpowers) and a super-stretchy wife (Holly Hunter).  He gets himself duped into going to a remote island, not knowing that a new supervillian named Syndrome (Jason Lee) has his sights set on all superheros including the incredible family and their close friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).<br /><br />The story may have a lengthy set-up, but it is worth it because it gets us to know the family, dysfunctions and all.  Writer Bird gets you in the head of this family of heros, making their eventual plight against syndrome all the more compelling, with the necessary detours of humor, with the funniest in the form of the short and out-spoken fashion designer Edna Mode (voiced by Bird).  But when the film does get going, does it ever rev up.  Spectacular explosions and action sequences provide pixar animators with a chane to show off their boundless prowess.  The animation is absolutely breath-taking.  Where "Finding Nemo" used bold and vivid colors to illuminate the sea, here the animators stretch for photo-realism, or as real as you can get with a computer animated cartoon.  But the jungle environment is eye-popping and the robotic death machine that Syndrome unleashes twitches with attitude.  With an eye-popping mix of heart, humor and animation, "The Incrdibles" is one of the best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>There's little to be said that hasn't already been said about this terrific movie. Not only is it (vastly) technically superior to the CGI offerings from other studios (and a significant improvement even on Pixar's previous offerings), but it again proves that Pixar understands what makes a great film -- story, story, story. The story is character-driven, not plot-driven, a point most Hollywood film makers seem to have forgotten. The characters have believable personalities, legitimate problems, and interact in plausible ways.<br /><br />Which brings me to a point that _hasn't_ been addressed by many reviewers. The PG rating notwithstanding, the insistance of the filmmakers on treating the material in a fundamentally serious way (which has been true of _all_ Pixar feature films) makes "The Incredibles" a _very_ dark film. Though we never see a verifiable on-screen death, most of Syndrome's minions are offed (directly or indirectly) by the Parrs, usually in an explosion or crash. We later learn that Syndrome is a serial killer, having murdered at least a dozen superheroes. And Syndrome himself perishes when he's ground up in the jet engine of his own plane (though this is off-camera, as well).<br /><br />Leaving the theater, I asked a father if he thought "The Incredibles" veered dangerously close to being PG-13, and -- to my surprise -- he agreed. "The previews were all of the funny stuff." (The hysterical scene of an oversized Mr. Incredible trying to get into an undersized super-suit is not in the film.)<br /><br />The reason for the "real" (though mostly unshown) violence of "The Incredibles" is likely the result of the tendency over the last two decades to treat science-fiction and fantasy stories as if they were character-driven dramas (qv, Xena). This is good, because it makes for engaging and believable story-telling. But it also means the villains have to be much nastier -- more like Hannibal Lecter than Captain Hook. "Real" characters need "real" threats (qv, "A Bug's Life").<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is a surprisingly violent film, and I urge parents to think twice before taking kids much under 12.</p></br><a href="../users/A37B3O457INKEA.html">A37B3O457INKEA</a><br/><p>THE INCREDIBLES is a first-class animated film about a superhero and his family who are forced to seek the anonymity of a government witness protection program to escape a rash of lawsuits orchestrated by their enemies. Mr. Incredible has to endure the boredom of a job as an insurance claims specialist while his wife and children cooperate by also concealing their extraordinary powers in front of others. This is hardest on the children as they play with youngsters at school and on the athletic field. Eventually, Mr. Incredible is lured out of retirement on a ruse by a former foe. By now Mr. Incredible is older and fatter but he still proves equal to the challenge. The rest of the movie is filled with excitement and comical moments as Mr. Incredible finds himself in a tight spot from which only his family can rescue him. The cast is headed by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Ms. Hunter supplies the voice for Elastigirl who is also the wife of Mr. Incredible.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLES was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Achievement in Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Oscars were won for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and Best Achievement in Sound Editing. In addition, THE INCREDIBLES won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Bob and Helen Parr (Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter) have recently moved into their new suburban home with their three children, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox) and baby Jack Jack. Bob spends his day behind a desk at an insurance company and Helen stays at home. Attempting to blend in in the suburbs is difficult for them, but especially difficult for Bob. He used to be Mr. Incredible, before a series of lawsuits forced all of the Supers into retirement. Helen has acclimated more easily, but finds it difficult to keep a lid on their children's burgeoning super powers. Jack and his friend, Lucius (Samuel L. Jackson) go out for a boy's night, which for Bob includes listening to police scanners and trying to find clandestine ways to use his superpowers. After rescuing folks from a burning building, Bob returns home. But the fire has been ignited again. He soon receives a mysterious offer and jumps at the chance to use his powers again. Learning that many of the other Supers in retirement have disappeared, Mr. Incredible comes face to face with Syndrome (Jason Lee), the new villain in town.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is easily one of the most appropriately named films to be made in a long time. It is simply that. The newest film from Pixar combines human characters with the same attention to detail that has made all of their previous films so memorable.<br /><br />Written and directed by Brad Bird, the director of "The Iron Giant", a thoroughly underrated traditionally animated film released some years ago by Warner Bros., has found the perfect home for his talents, "The Incredibles" represents the perfect marriage of director and studio. Bird has been working on this project for a number of years, even before he started working with Pixar. At Pixar, they were able to help him realize his vision through computer animation. My friend Shannon described the film to someone as a "great action film that's animated". I couldn't have said it better myself.<br /><br />Shortly after the theatrical release, there was an article about the film and Bird in `Los Angeles' Magazine. It described how obsessed Bird became with every detail. This was his baby and he wasn't going to take any shortcuts. It clearly shows in every frame of the film.<br /><br />The film deftly blends comedy, edge of your seat suspense, great visuals, bright, colorful animation and great voice acting.<br /><br />The scenes of the Parr family living in suburbia are truly funny. To watch Bob, a huge hulking guy with a broad torso (think Superman, crammed into a small mini car, drive into his driveway and sullenly walk inside his home perfectly captures how many people feel about their lives. Violet and Dash are portrayed in a very realistic way. Violet is the older child, in Junior High, shy and afraid to talk to the boy she likes. Dash is the younger, more outgoing, precocious kid. They behave like a normal brother and sister would. They fight all the time. But if they have to help each other, they do and this shows that they really care about one another. Helen is gamely making a go of it in suburbia, because she is afraid of the consequences if her family's true identity is revealed.<br /><br />If you took all of the scenes of the family in suburbia and made a film simply of those, the result would be a great stand alone addition to any comedy library.<br /><br />After the family gets drawn into the action plot, things really kick into gear. Deftly combining elements of filmed superhero movies, James Bond adventures and action films, "The Incredibles" creates an amazing backdrop to tell an involving, exciting story.<br /><br />Many of the action sequences are set in buildings and landscapes clearly inspired by the James Bond films of the 60s. As Jack and Helen make their way through Syndrome's headquarters, a structure inspired by "Dr. No" or "You Only Live Twice", the filmmakers also play music inspired by 007 films. This provides a nice, unique and fun visual reference for the adults, to keep their attention.<br /><br />The action scenes are visually stunning, especially a scene referred to as the "100 Yard Dash". In it, Dash runs back and forth throughout the forest, trying to stay ahead of Syndrome's army of goons who are chasing him in small flying saucers. The camera moves at dizzying speeds, back and forth, up and down. It would have been extremely difficult to do this with live action.<br /><br />The film also takes an irreverent tone towards super hero films; much like "Scream" made fun of horror films. A scene in which Jack and Helen visit Edna, the costume designer to the Supers, evokes similar scenes between James Bond and Q. Edna is a hilarious character, inspired by famed costume designer Edith Head, and voiced by director Brad Bird. All of the clich&eacute;s of superhero films make appearances. For instance, Mr. Incredible tosses out a one-liner when he dispatches a villain, creating a pun about his name, much like James Bond does. Jack and Lucius talk about `monologueing', a trait they came across many times as Supers. After capturing them, the villain would begin a monologue about his greatness, in the process giving them time to escape.<br /><br />All of the voice actors are spot on. Craig T. Nelson (TV's "Coach") does a great job of capturing the boredom of everyman working a humdrum life and the unabashed excitement at doing something he is truly excited about. Holly Hunter is great as Helen and Elastigirl. Her lilting Southern drawl provides her character with an innocence that masks her toughness. The two child actors capture the moods and attitudes of children growing up. Violet has a voice that is low and bored, but will probably change any minute. Dash is always excited or extremely bored. Jason Lee is also great as the crazed Buddy and Syndrome, the villain, perfectly capturing the glee of the more over the top villains from other films. Samuel L. Jackson's role as Lucius and Frozone is also very effective. He is a bit more like Helen, than Jack, trying to acclimate to civilian life, but when the opportunity presents itself, he immediately throws himself into the role of Super.<br /><br />The animation in any Pixar film is top notch, and "The Incredibles" is no exception. What you might not notice is that with each new film, the animation becomes even more advanced and realistic. As mentioned before, this is the first Pixar film with an all `human' cast'. The attention to detail on each of the characters is amazing. Especially the hair. In previous digital animation, the hair has provided problems. For instance, in the first "Toy Story", there is a little puppy. He looks good, but he looks animated. In the second, this puppy looks 100 times better, because the software for animating the hair was that much more evolved. In "The Incredibles", each of the humans appears to have real hair, especially Syndrome, whose shock of hair resembles a large flame. There are many details which still appear `cartoonish', but these are intentional, for the sake of laughter; for instance, Bob's small car. I have no doubt that Pixar could animate a film that looked almost photorealistic.<br /><br />Bird is clearly in tune with superheroes. His previous film "The Iron Giant" is a very effective, sweet-natured homage to the sci-fi films of the 50s. Using traditional animation, he evokes a story of a lonely boy who stumbles across an Iron Giant. They become friends, but there are problems when the townsfolk realize that a giant robot from outer space is living in the vicinity.<br /><br />The DVD for "The Incredibles" is simply beautiful. The widescreen version of the film is clear, bright and colorful. Of course, since the film was created in computers, the transfer is naturally going to be more brilliant than a traditional film transfer.<br /><br />The second disc in the set contains a Making of Documentary, complete files on all of the Supers, an `early' animated effort featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone, deleted scenes, and a `new' cartoon called "Jack Jack Attack".<br /><br />In the film, there is a moment in which Helen calls home to check on the babysitter watching Jack Jack, the baby. The babysitter has left a series of frantic messages. It is a funny scene. "Jack Jack Attack" is a short cartoon depicting the events leading up to the phone messages, before the family returns home. I am pretty sure that this cartoon was created from footage cut out of the original film. Perhaps they felt it was running too long. It is fun to watch the footage, but when a character, from the film, makes an appearance at the end of the short, it sort of gives away the real origin of this footage. As a stand alone cartoon, there is no reason for this character to appear. As I said, its fun to watch, but it really should have been included in the Deleted Scenes area, and not billed as a new creation. It's a great idea to create new shorts featuring these characters, as Disney did with Roger Rabbit.<br /><br />The Deleted Scenes are interesting and include an alternate opening that is more than a little odd. Thankfully, they didn't use it or any of the other deleted scenes. These scenes are presented as animatics, a sort of rough draft of the film, that animators use to make sure everything is working well, before doing all of the final (most time consuming and expensive phase) animation.<br /><br />The `early' animated short, with commentary by Mr. Incredible and Frozone, is interesting, but odd. I really think this was created recently, as part of the filmmaking process. Not as some sort of early project by Brad Bird. I could be wrong.<br /><br />The complete files of the Supers (which Mr. Incredible quickly scrolls through in a scene in the film) are interesting to read through. There are also audio files from each of the Supers, in their voices, talking about their lives.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is yet another top-notch addition to the Pixar library and yet another top-notch DVD that belongs in every collection.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>This movie can be summed up in four words: BEST ANIMATED MOVIE EVER!!!  This is the first animated film (that wasn't a sequel) to actually get me hyped in years, and fortunately, I was not only not let down, I was amazed and happy with the quality of the animation, the story, and the dialogue.<br /><br />The Incredibles takes place in a world where superheroes are common.  Its kind of like X-Men, where some people are born with special powers, and while some use them for good, others use them for evil.  A few of these supers (as they are called) include Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), who is endowed with superstrength, his girlfriend/wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), who can stretch her body and create a variety of shapes, and their friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), who can freeze any water in the area, including moisture in the air.  For a while, things are great for them until a bunch of lawsuits against superheroes begin to be filed by people who either did not want to be saved or who were injured while being saved.  In order to help the supers out, the government created a Superhero Relocation Program.  Lucious Best, Bob Parr, and Helen Parr (the true identities of the three aforementioned heroes) were forced to move to suburbia and live out their lives like normal citizens.<br /><br />15 years later, the Parrs have a daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell), who can turn invisible and create energy barriers, and two sons.  One of them is Dash (Spencer Fox), who can travel at super speeds, and the other one is baby Jack Jack, who doesn't have any powers (they think).  The Parr family suffers from most of the traditional family problems; Dash is a bit of a troublemaker at school, while Violet is a maladjust who often feels invisible (both physically and mentally).  Bob is stuck in a crappy insurance job, and he constantly incurs the wrath of his boss (voiced by Wallace Shawn) for helping customers too much.  Bob and Helen's marriage is on the rocks because Bob wants to relive his glory days as Mr. Incredible despite the risk of lawsuits, while Helen knows that the past must be put behind them.  Things only get worse when a mysterious fellow super named Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) offers a job to Bob that requires him to become Mr. Incredible again.  Originally, the biggest problem is that Helen thinks that Bob is having an affair, but things get much worse when Mr. Incredible realizes that Mirage tricked him; he was brought out of retirement by Syndrome (Jason Lee), a man that idolized Mr. Incredible as a youth.  The young Syndrome (then calling himself Incredi-boy) always tried to tag along with Mr. Incredible, but due to a lack of powers, Mr. Incredible always dismissed him.  However, Syndrome is a mechanical genius, and he built numerous weapons to sell and use against supers.  The rest of the Parr family is forced to suit up to rescue the missing patriarch.<br /><br />This movie is incredibly funny.  There is no shortage of jokes, whether they are sight gags or spoken.  There were many points were the dialogue was drowned out by all the laughing going on (but I didn't see it in a theater; I saw it in a classroom/auditorium at an advance screening at my university).  A plus for older people is that many of the jokes exist on two levels, however, there were a few that I'm surprised made it into a kids movie, but I'm glad they were included as they were extremely funny (like the line about taking shots).  Also, the character of Edna Mode (the writer/director Brad Bird) just stole the show despite only being in the film for about 10-15 minutes.  Edna is a fashion designer who did a lot of work for supers back in the day, and her mansion and mannerisms are priceless.<br /><br />the visuals of this film are stunning.  I can remember one scene above the ocean, and the water was the most realistic that I've ever seen.<br /><br />This is definitely the darkest/most grown up Pixar film yet (the first to earn a PG instead of a G rating).  One of the first shots (after the hilarious interview opening) involves someone loading a sub-machine gun.  The film deals with affairs, teenage angst (Violet), jealousy, and (in)equality.<br /><br />This is definitely a must-see for, well just about anyone!  If you liked the previous Pixar films (and who hasn't) I guarantee you will like this.  Even if you haven't seen/liked the previous films, you should definitely give this one a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I have seen every single Disney/Pixar film so far, and I think they just keep getting better.<br /><br />That is definately the case with this one.

While much of the Pixar filmography is aimed at the younger set (albeit with plenty of goodies for the adults to delight in, too), "The Incredibles" is a definite turn toward a more mature audience.<br /><br />The plot of "The Incredibles" is well-known -- a family of superheroes are denied the right to exercise their talents by our litigious society -- the "supers'" fall from grace is the subject of a wonderful opening sequence.  Placed in a superhero-relocation program (as the Parr family, appropriately enough), the "supers" chafe at their imposed restrictions -- one of the strongest themes of the movie is the undeniable power of a person's need to achieve their full potential.<br /><br />Stuck in a cubicle in suburbia, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) jumps at the resume his former superhero identity on the sly . . . a plot that leads him into a potential (and apparent) affair as well as a clash with Syndrome (Jason Lee), a mad scientist-superhero hybrid from Mr. Incredible's past.<br /><br />Soon the rest of the Parrs are on the hunt to save their captured patriarch.  Mrs. Parr, aka Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and her tots, Dash and Violet risk death and dismemberment (in some amazing chase scenes sure to inspire a heck of a video game) as they seek to save dear old dad.  Their quest takes them from a tropical island to the streets of the Big City where Syndrome unleashes the ultimate killer robot.  Allied with old chum Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), the Incredibles put up a tremendous fight against Syndrome and his colossus - a delight for fans of all ages.<br /><br />For parents of tykes, be warned that this movie is a bit more mature than "A Bug's Life," "Toy Story," and other Pixar fare.  There is a sub-plot involving possible marital infidelity, although it doesn't go very deep in exploring this, and it's undeniable that Mr. Incredible adores Elastigirl, and vice versa.  Many of Syndrome's anonymous henchmen obviously die in high-speed chases (their cool flying vehicles crash in blazing glory, leaving their grim fate pretty obvious), and Syndrome is a lethal opponent of the "supers."  This is a bit dark for some youngsters and parents may have some 'splainin' to do to their younger kids, so be warned -- don't pop in this DVD just 'cause it says "Pixar" and presume that no child will be a bit frightened.  Most kids will absolutely adore this movie, of course, as will most adults.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are wonderful - two animated shorts, "Boundin'," which is an enchanting poem about a vain sheep and a wise jackalope, as well as a snippet of a parallel story from the movie involving a hilarious babysitter are sure to delight. There's even a silly retro-cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone in more "primitive" times, and this extra is even more enjoyable when the commentary track is employed. There are no "out-takes" that I could find, which was a disappointment, but all things considered this is an excellent DVD for a wonderful family film.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>well time humor, great character personalities, and a well written script, and great directing drive this movie to become one of the best animated films ever made.

But before that happens all super-hero's are band from public view forever, due to liabilities.  Then a bad-guy comes into play after several years of our super-hero family being in hiding, out for revenge against our super-hero dad, for rejecting him as a side-kick years earlier.

I loved Batman and Superman as a kid, and this movie conjured up those good old memories for me.

The DVD adds many, many wonderful additions to the top-notch theater-going experience, including a short, deliberately cheesy Saturday-morning style cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and pal Frozone, and a funny, amazing adventure (decidedly NOT cheesy) showing baby Jack-Jack dealing with his babysitter.  This really is a great DVD of a great movie.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>The first thing I noticed when seeing this movie was the hair.<br /><br />As a former computer programmer the rendering of the hair it was done not as a block as you often see.  It was very well done, must have been thousands of hours of work by a top notch team.  It portends an even brighter future but will be forgotten over the years as we become used to the miracles of the computer.  A shame that such an effort will be forgotten.<br /><br />What will NOT be forgotten is first rate writing, plotting and a story and a moral that will pass the test of time.  It was as entertaining as a movie can get, excellent for all ages.<br /><br />All the bugaboos of modern PC are hit, from a sue-happy public, to enforced mediocrity "Everyone is special which means nobody is."<br /><br />Add to that action, comedy and you have a real winner.<br /><br />Go see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"That was so..., WICKED!!" - the kid next door comments on his neighbors' version of neighborhood crimewatch law enforcement in "The Incredibles"<br /><br />One of the great films of 2004 is all animation and all kick-ass. No, its not "Shrek 2".<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is a great family film that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />This is also, & surprisingly, one of those films that you should see on the big screen & not on home video.<br /><br />Everyone knows what a superhero is. But, after saving a creep from his suicide attempt, Mr. Incredible & his fellow league of superheros are band by the Government from donning there supersuits & saving innocent citizens, forcing them to live, eternally, as there secret identities. This is only, of course, after the suicide creep wins a victorious lawsuit against Incredible for injuries in the rescue, as well as, invading the creep's privacy.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible still saves the day, only now as an insurance claims adjustor, saving the city's people, one claim at a time. His wife, Helen, aka, Elasti-Girl, plays housewife to her & Incredible's three kids, Dash, a youngster who lives up to his name, Violet, the troubled teen who can dissapear at will, & Jack-Jack, the youngest family member with powers that are, well, mixed to say the least.<br /><br />Basically, its the not-so Fantastic Five & a ho-hum life, with Mr.Incredible yearning for the hero fighting days of old, Helen reminding him to live in & get used to the now, & breaking up the regular fighting between Violet & Dash, if they could just catch either one of them.<br /><br />Things start to pick up when a secret transmission message is found in Incredible's work briefcase telling him that there is a secret mission for him if he wants it & the reward is triple his usual yearly income, if he decides to take it.<br /><br />What Mr. Incredible doesn't know is that sinister forces are at work and its all a trap, led by a youngster who is Incredible's #1 fan.<br /><br />I was constantly reminded throughout most of this year that this movie was coming to theatres on Nov. 5, 2004, thanks to the trailer that you can not avoid on the "Finding Nemo" DVD. But, it was well worth the pay off (the film will probably be the big movie for the Xmas season right along with "The Polar Express").<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is basically, bits of the Marvel Comic "The Fantastic Four" with a dash of Disney, with PIXAR animation & humor. All of the characters are great and well thought-out.<br /><br />The animation is top notch with new advances that leap off the screen (especially, during the action sequences).<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if "The Incredibles" walked off with the best animated film Oscar of '04.<br /><br />Its that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>This move was PERFECT!

When I saw "The Incredibles" in the theatre I was blown away by the films striking visuals which I thought even surpassed their amazing work in "Finding Nemo".  What intrigued me in a second viewing of the film was the calibre of the writing.  Why I was looking for this aspect was that it was nominated for an Academy award for it's writing.  I can say with all certainty that this film is rich in texture, deep characterization, and magnificent storytelling.  Visuals are nice but if you don't have a good story to go with them, so what.  Director-writer Brad Bird successfully marries these two elements.  The film is more than deserving of the Oscar it received for best animated feature.  Inarguably it was one of the better films of 2004.  The Academy created the animated feature category so that high quality animated films did not have to compete with live action films.  If that category hadn't been created "The Incredibles" would have been very competitive with it's live action counterparts.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Superman, Daredevil, The X-Men, and The Amazing Spider-Man - classic comic-book superheroes that have captured the imaginations of not only young children, but those young at heart as well across the world. Though they may have started off small in the two-dimensional world of the nickel comic-books, their popularity began to grow and expanded into spectacular franchises that were developed in the areas of television series, movies, and merchandising. Some have done better then others - as of this writing, Ben Affleck is still not speaking to Tobey Maguire - but no matter what the success, there will always be an audience for these fascinating figures. What is the cause for our fascinating fixation with these individuals and their seamlessly conventional plot-lines that are all basically a regurgitation of the vintage hero myth? In a way, we understand what the hero is going through and connect with the overwhelming obstacles that block his/her path to achieving his/her goal, what ever that may be. These amazing individuals are experiencing the same events we have experiences in our own lives, on an obviously different plane of course, and as they go about achieving their objectives, we look to them for inspiration in do so in our own time and place in the world.<br /><br />The story centers on a family of superheroes that try and go about their daily, normal lives as civil citizens while at the same time concealing their extraordinary powers in an effort to blend in with the regular populous. Bob Parr, a faithful husband and father of three children, drives every day to work for a sleazy insurance company that cares more about their stockholders then their own clients, only to drag himself back home and repeat the process for the rest of the year. While at work, Bob dreams of the glory days when he was the world's greatest superhero, known exclusively as Mr. Incredible! That all came to an end when he was sued by a man he saved who apparently didn't want to be saved (he leaped off the top of a building in an attempt to commit suicide). This, of course, set off a string of frivolous lawsuits against all superheroes, costing the American government, as well as the taxpayers of this country, millions of dollars. The league of superheroes were eventually forced into retirement and relocated to new locations in order to live out a life of solidarity and blend in with the rest of normal society, never to use their powers for the collective good of humanity again. One night, Bob discovers an envelope in his briefcase that holds a communication device asking him to come to a secret island and take care of a rampaging robot located there that has been terrorizing a scientific organization established on the tropic location. When it turns out to be a trap, the rest of his family, including his wife, daughter and son, must summon up their abilities in order to rescue the patriarch of the Incredible family and save the day before the world is doomed. The story for The Incredibles is, for the most part, unfortunately clich&eacute;d and excruciatingly predictable, but, then again, isn't every film about superheroes that way? How so? Within the first five minutes of the film, you've discovered who the villain is and determined in which direction the storyline is heading toward, which, in essence, eliminates any real surprises that would occur within the course of the two hour feature. Don't let this matter bother you too much though. The more appropriate question that should be asked about this film is whether or not The Incredibles still manages to be overly entertaining and the answer would unanimously be yes. See, that's the amazing thing about Pixar - they can take a cookie-cutter storyline, throw in a few dozen loveable characters, mind-blowing visual work, and pure-concentrated emotions, unveiling an absolutely genuine and memorable experience at the movies.<br /><br />Once again, as was the case with Finding Nemo, Pixar decides to live on the edge and create an animated film featuring few famous voices - actually, the only truly recognizable name would be Samuel L. Jackson - but if it worked before, it is certainly worth a second attempt at least. Craig T. Nelson, best known as for his television series Coach on ABC, fits perfectly into the voice-role of the leading man, Mr. Incredible. Nelson truly puts effort into voicing the emotions of Bob Parr - from being frustrated at work, to uninterested and down in the dumps back at home, to emotionally distraught at the possible loss of his family. This is another prominent area where Pixar excels beyond other studios, namely in choosing figures who are perfect for the leading role, not just because their name would look good on the marquee, but that they effectively move the film forward consistently and thoroughly with their emotional performance. Samuel L. Jackson, who voices the ultra-cool Frozone, is unfortunately underused in the film. Granted, he isn't a central character - he's more of a supporting role, the buddy figure to the Mr. Incredible figure, but still essential none-the-less - but he could have been given more scenes then the ones you can just as easily see located in the film's trailers. An absolute waste of perfectly good talent it would seem. John Ratzenberger, known exclusively as the lucky charm of the Pixar Animation Studios, is highly underused in this feature. This isn't asking for him to be given a leading part or anything of that sort, but let's not wait to use him for the very end, and if you do, not just a mere few words. This was disappointing to say the least but nothing to go ballistic about. And last, but not least, Edna Mode, voiced brilliantly by writer/director Brad Bird - is there anything this man can't do - is the most original and effective creation presented in the film. Viewed as the fashion feminista to the superhero stars, she may not be a central character based on the actions on screen, but audiences won't care as she manages to deliver the most laughs out of anyone else.<br /><br />Overall, The Incredibles, despite lacking the tenacious punch of such previous Pixar success stories as Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc., still manages to engage viewers and connect with them in such a spectacular and seamless way that it makes them  - well, incredible. One of the film's main problems is its serious lack of humor, at least early on, but even when it is able to get revved up by the second half, the laughs aren't as consistent and thorough as they were in either Monsters Inc. or even Finding Nemo. Don't take this the wrong way, there are plenty of amusing sequences to be found throughout the feature - this bears repeating, Edna Mode practically steals every scene she's in - they're just fewer and farther between then has been seen in previous Pixar efforts. In reality though, this helps a lot as it allows the story to be set up properly, as predictable as it may be on the surface, and the emotional attachment to the characters to set in with audience members, so that when things really do begin to pick-up, we are in eager anticipation to witness what comes next. Another problem the feature has to deal with, besides the "been there, done that" atmosphere it invokes, is the fact that the actions of the film begin to feel like a broken record. It just begins to feel like a continuous loop of sequences - someone's in danger then they get out of it then they're in danger again, etc. As Mr. Incredible said once, "I feel like the maid - can we try and keep this clean for ten minutes", how about we try something and then move on with a vastly different story idea instead of the same one over and over again. These are relatively minor quips though and shouldn't be taken for too much face value when evaluating this film with your family. The talented artists and animators at Pixar Animation Studios have truly out done themselves this around. And to think, you thought you've seen everything with Finding Nemo! There are moments where you'll believe Syndrome's Island is an actual island - the palm trees, the ocean water, and the daunting aerial view of the location are astonishing. And the waterfalls - truly breathtaking. There are so few words to accurately describe the feeling you get watching the visuals of this film - this after drooling over the latest Star Wars prequel teaser trailer moments before. And finally, in all honesty, The Incredibles has to be Disney and Pixar's most adult-skewed animated feature to date - not only does it showcase an array of dramatic explosions and presumed deaths, the touchy subjects of adultery and suicide are even touched upon in the two hour film. Even though a lot of this material will probably go over the head of youngsters, be well aware that questions may pop into their inquisitive minds and may be asked of you later on, so be prepared to answer them should they come up. Bottom-line, The Incredibles may not be Pixar's most superior film to date - Finding Nemo had more adorable characters and Monsters Inc. had far more laughs - but its an entertaining family film that gives every single member of the family something to talk about for weeks, or even months, to come going into the busy holiday season.</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />For decades the predominant theme of the superhero universe is that possessing super powers is a stressful burden fraught with peril, lack of reward, and worst of all, an ungrateful public. The Marvel pantheon has promulgated that realistic but depressing notion through almost all its characters (notably the Hulk, Spiderman, the Thing, and especially the X-Men) to such a pervasive degree that DC Comics, home to the "demigod" Superman, had to follow suit. Superman, formerly invincible and infallible, suddenly became saddled with multiple vulnerabilities, inhibitions, and doubts. Again, this realistic approach is thought-provoking and an important factor in the success of the "Spiderman" movie franchise. But let's be honest; if you had a super power, ANY super power, wouldn't you have the time of your life?<br /><br />"The Incredibles" answers this question with an exuberant "yes!". I will not dwell upon the movies many virtues, since other posters have already done a thorough job of that. I wish to emphasize that "The Incredibles" succeeds to a large degree by inverting the above-mentioned Marvel superhero theory, "regressing" back to the 50's and 60's and reminding us that, in the final analysis, being a superhero is freaking great. Bob Parr (aka. Mr. Incredible) revels in his abilities and his responsibility to humanity. Unlike with Spiderman, et. al., his powers are not a curse but an unadulterated blessing and his raison d'etre. Unlike Spiderman, et. al. he does not want to be a normal member of the herd, to be equal to them. He wants to be, and is, different, and better. That's why his speedster son Dash (a.k.a. Dashiel's) remark that "when everyone is special, no one is" resonates. Mr. Incredible was wasting away in Conformityville; to survive and keep his sanity, he had to put on the tights.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is thus not a scathing satire of superheroes, except for a few jabs at Mr. Incredible's spare tire, and Ms. Mode's hilarious montage on the dangerous absurdity of capes (for which archvillain Syndrome apparently did not get the memo). It treats superbeings with respect, and not just Mr. Incredible. As the movie unfolds, it progresses from a stately (perhaps slow) state of domesticity and family to a crescendo of Action with a capital A. Of course, "The Incredibles" does acknowledge and juxtapose super heroism with reality (at least the reality of tortuous lawsuits, oppressive "Dilbertseque" corporate workplaces, and the unpleasantness of adolescence through Dash and Violet). But the movie eventually and gloriously breaks free, and so do Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, and Violet!<br /><br />The only "flaw" I could perceive in "The Incredibles" is its somewhat derivative nature and amalgamated blend of every superhero, James Bond, Spy Kids, and Powerpuff Girls conceit ever revealed. So what? Good for the movie! I eagerly await the family's next adventure and perhaps the obligatory "origin stories". I hope the sequels continue to keep the proceedings fun.<br /><br />A few random observations:<br /><br />1. Mr. Incredible has his foibles (his expanded gut, his initial neglect of his family, and his occasional Buzz Lightyearesque imperiousness), but he is no buffoon and no joke by any stretch of the imagination. His family is recognizably human but quite laudable.<br /><br />2. In an early scene in the movie, just before Mr. Incredible in his younger days confronts supervillain Bomb Voyage, the illumination hitting his old suit makes him look like Green Lantern.<br /><br />3. The Omnidroids Mr. Incredible and family battle resemble a cross between Dr. Octopus's tentacles and a bathysphere.<br /><br />4. Brad Bird must be a Fantastic Four fan!<br /><br />5. Evangelical Christians will probably be aghast at Baby Jack-Jack's climactic encounter with Syndrome (which got the loudest cheer from the theater audience I was involved in).<br /><br />6. Though spawned by frustrated geeky fan-boy aspirations, I thought Syndrome made a formidable and even occasionally sympathetic villain, channeling both the Joker and an evil Mask (as well as, ahem, Heat Miser of course).<br /><br />7. One cannot trademark a superpower.<br /><br />8. I wonder if Marvel will ever contract with Pixar to do a comic rendition of "The Incredibles".<br /><br />9. Apparently Mr. Incredible possesses strength in the "Class 100" range, easily able to bench over 100 tons. But does he possess other powers? He cannot fly under his own power, but is he invulnerable, have optic and auditory powers, etc.? What are the extent of his family's abilities?<br /><br />10. I'm glad the Parrs did not have a super-powered pooch or other pet a la Krypto, unless that comes up in the sequel.<br /><br />11. The PG rating is warranted. Pre-preteeners will find the movie by turns a bit too intense and slow-going, as the occasional infantile whines in my movie audience can attest to. Savvy adults and older teenagers will probably enjoy the movie the most!<br /><br />By the way, I bought the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AY39CRKDV5L8S.html">AY39CRKDV5L8S</a><br/><p>Purchased this for my grown daughter - VHS just doesn't cut it - by the time a new format comes out - she'll have to buy her own</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>The standard-bearer of excellence for the Pixar animation house has aged well in the seven years since its release, and it should be no surprise. With a clever, all-ages sense of humor, a masterfully paced storyline, wonderfully rounded characters and genuinely perfect casting, the filmmakers have left little cause for concern. Spotted throughout with nods, winks and nudges of all shapes and sizes for the dedicated comic book fans that are bound to be in the audience, the plot remains easily-accessible for those who may have never even seen a funny book. On top of that, its excellent sense of timing and regular ability to one-up itself is more than enough to ensure no eyeballs wander far from the center of the screen.

I love all their films and having to pick one as your favorite is a really tough decision that has to be done with some serious thinking. They're that good. Still, as fantastic as every Pixar film is, I've always have had a softer spot for The Incredibles and I have to call it my favorite Pixar film.<br /><br />Since its release in 2004, TI has been one of my favorite films of all time. The story is excellent, the characters are endearing, it's action packed and has amazing animation. Brad Bird really created a masterpiece. TI resonate in so many levels because it's not only a fantastic super hero film, it's also a fantastic film about family, relationships, and a lot more. It's really a very sophisticated movie that perhaps will entertain the adults more than the children but, as with every Pixar film, TI has a wide appeal and is high quality entertainment for everyone.<br /><br />At long last, Disney has released the film in Blu-Ray and what a release it is!!!<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />As with every Pixar film on Blu, it's no surprise that TI comes to HD looking absolutely demo-quality. The level of sharpness and detail is mesmerizing, colors are bright and blacks are balanced. Also, compression artifacts are nowhere to be found in the print. The DVD looked great for SD but looking TI on Blu is like watching it all over again and is a joy to do it. A fantastic transfer through and through.<br /><br />The audio features a 5.1 DTS-HD MA that will absolutely will knock you out!!! The sound is so clear, so vibrant that you will believe the crashings and the bangings are happening in your living room. Dialogue is also crystal clear.

If you're reading this review you've probably seen it and know all about the fact that like Marvel comics, it takes the superhero and puts a uniquely human spin where not everyone gets along all the time kind of like real life.<br /><br />All of the extras from the previous two disc DVD edition have been ported over to the second Blu-ray disc (and the extras that were on DVD one in the original edition are on disc one here as well). Aside from getting a digital copy (isn't than an oxymoron since they are ALL digital--perhaps calling it a portable device copy is too cumbersome), the new stuff includes the following featurettes: Paths to Pixar: Story Artists a six minute behind-the-scenes glimpse into how the storyw as developed; Studio Stories: Gary's Birthday-an amusing story about the production of the film and it's animated no less; Ending with a Bang: Making the End Credits which is pretty self descriptive, character profiles (in SD), all the trailers plus The New Nomanisan: A Top Secret Redevelopment Plan a clever short animated piece showing how Syndrome's island was turned into a resort.<br /><br />The film looks positively breath taking with a stunning, richly detailed transfer that has superior depth and puts the original DVD (which was state-of-the-art at the time) to shame.<br /><br />The retail price for this set is unusually high ($45 although it is less expensive here at amazon) and I'd get it while you can at a lower cost if you want the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Is this set worth picking up again on Blu-ray? Yes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Incredibles (Brad Bird, 2004)<br /><br />The Incredibles is a fun little film when you watch it; interesting, kind of engaging, but nothing terribly special; it's doesn't reach out and grab hold of your throat and slap you around the room with its greatness the way Monsters, Inc. does. It's only later, when you've reflected on the little details for a while, that you come to realize how much of this film is simply, as the kids say these days, made of awesome.<br /><br />Bird, one of the better directors in the Pixar stable, filled this sucker chock-full of fun in-jokes for the adults whilst keeping the action coming for the kiddies. In this installment of the great Pixar dynasty, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has been forced into retirement after a rescue gone terribly wrong in the opening scenes. Mundane life is, shall we say, not treating him terribly well. He and his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have moved to the suburbs and are trying to raise their family-- all of whom, as it turns out, seem to have inherited superpowers from their parents-- in relative obscurity. The most superhero-like thing Mr. Incredible does is get together with his old pal Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) and talk over old times. Until, that is, he receives a secret message saying that his powers are needed...<br /><br />It's a fun movie, the kind of thing you expect from Pixar-- lots of action, witty dialogue, visual gags, a good time to be had by all. You'll enjoy it. But then, go and read the trivia page over at IMDB and marvel at the number of in-jokes in this movie. There are homages to what seems like every superhero comic, every movie any of these actors has ever worked in, every member of the crew. And none of them interferes with the movie's plot or pacing. That's brilliant. Either Bird is the world's biggest geek and had this entire thing cast before he started writing, or his eye for detail is unparalleled. (Or both.) It's the technical equivalent of the emotional punch of Monsters, Inc., and what makes it great is trying to think of another studio that could have cranked those two movies out back-to-back-- and not being able to come up with one. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A36NUDST4Y5JBA.html">A36NUDST4Y5JBA</a><br/><p>At first I was really upset with the makers of this story, as the Characters have powers from both Marvel and DC Comics.  But, when I finally saw the movie on cable, I had to admit, I actually liked it, a lot!  Let me lay out their powers:<br /><br />Mr. Incredible:<br /><br />1. Super strength (ala DC Comics Superman, Uncle Sam)<br /><br />Ms. Incredible:<br /><br />1. Streching ability (ala Marvel's Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, DC's Elongated Man)<br /><br />Violet:<br /><br />1. Ability to generate force fields and go invisible (ala Marvel's Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four and Jane Grey of the X-Men)<br /><br />Dash:<br /><br />1. Super Speed (ala DC's Kid Flash)<br /><br />Jack-Jack:<br /><br />1. Morphing Ability (his name escapes me, but I remember the Character "The Element Man" - I believe DC comics).<br /><br />After I got over my "prejudice," I found the movie very well done...they spent a buck (or two) making this feature.  Edna's security system just cracks me up!<br /><br />Finally, Congress should be mandated to watch Mr. Syndrome's character and learn from his dialogue. Particularly the line - "When everyone's Super - no one will be..."  You see we have had Nuclear Weapons advantage over the rest of the world for over fifty years.  That is coming rapidly to an end, as now everyone wants in, whether we approve or not.  So, to repeat:<br /><br />  "When everyone's Super - No one will be"<br /><br />I hope somebody heard what they are trying to say - I did!  Five stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>The Incredibles is fresh, funny, and touching.  The film is so great in all ways that I wish I could give it ten stars.  The story is about Jack Parr, who used to be Mr. Incredible, a super-strong superhero.  But he was retired by the government, along with the rest of the superheroes, when our litigious-happy society got out of control, and the government could not afford to settle all the lawsuits against superheroes.  All the heroes were relocated, and told to just fit in with the rest of the populace, and to conceal their superpowers.<br /><br />And so our story begins.  Jack is married to the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter).  They have three children: Dash, Violet, and Baby Jack-Jack.  Dash and Violet have superpowers, but are discouraged from using them.  Mom stays at home, while Dad has become an overweight, depressed insurance adjustor. The themes in this movie are very valid and very touching.  One theme is: why bend over backwards to make EVERYONE feel special - then no one will be.  Jack questions the importance of going to his son's "graduation" from fourth grade.<br /><br />The main theme is that life is empty without doing what you are meant to be doing.  Jack meets secretly with another superhero, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to listen to the police scanner and to sneak in and help - unseen.  A mysterious woman offers Mr. Incredible a secret mission.  Seeking meaning in his life, Mr. I. seizes the opportunity, while keeping it from his wife.<br /><br />Superheroes are not the only ones languishing, and longing for the glory days.  Uber-designer Edna Mole longs to design costumes the way she used to.  When Jack comes to her to patch up his old suit, she designs a brand-new suit for him - and one for each member of his family, even though they are not practicing superheroes.<br /><br />Edna completely stole the show.  She has the funniest lines in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>Because of a lawsuit, Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) and his wife Helen (Elastigirl) are forbidden to continue being superheroes.  When Mr. Incredible gets the opportunity to be a superhero again, he jumps at the chance.  What he doesn't know is that this is just a trick to have him destroyed by his worst enemy.  Now, it's up to the Incredibles to save him from the terrible Buddy Pine<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a lot because it is very humorous, and some parts were absolutely hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>Finding Nemo was a dud, so it is great to report that whatever rot had set at Pixar in has surely stopped: Whereas Nemo was an impressive visual spectacle but a poor, mawkishly sentimental (ie, typical Disney) piece of cinema, the Incredibles manages not only to set new standards in digital animation (there's a clear message to the Revenge of the Sith producers, and it's "beat this, George Lucas!"), but do it in the context of a clever, knowing, arch and stylish script and cleverly worked screenplay.<br /><br />It's true: the old Pixar of Monsters, Inc. is back, and better than ever.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>'The Incredibles' does Pixar's creative team proud once more, blending literally jaw-dropping CGI animations with excellent voice talent, huge production values, a hefty dose of humour, and most importantly, an excellent storyline.<br /><br />Blacklisted and in a Hero Protection Programme, because of a legal loophole that allows Superheroes to be sued, the Parr family appears to be, at least to the casual observer, an average, traditional family of suburbanites. Dad works in Insurance, Mom stays at home with the kids. Normalcy being relative, however, frustrated father Bob accepts an invitation from the mysterious 'Mirage' to help her tame a wild robot, thus resuming his activities as the superhero Mr. Incredible.<br /><br />And in the grand traditions of dual identities, action and adventure, and double-crossings, the Parr family is caught up in a plot to exterminate all Do-Gooders.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful - super-deformed characters move with a grace and fluidity that makes their cartoony world believable, and water and flame effects surpass even those seen in 'Finding Nemo'. The direction, too, is superlative - who can say what the latter 'Batman' movies might have been if they'd had this sort of creative impetus behind the camera?<br /><br />Vocal talent comes in the shape of Craig T. Nelson as lovable and impulsive Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as his frustrated wife Elastigirl, and Brad Bird's absolutely hilarious turn as superhero designer-turned-couturier Edna Mode is some of the best characterisation Pixar's ever given us.<br /><br />With such wonderful source material as this, a movie of a lesser storyline could have been catapulted into the ranks of animation greats, but thankfully Pixar scores on this front, too, and via a series of quirky events and clever, more mature themes (legal battles and infidelity - albeit very suitable for kids), 'The Incredibles' may well be even more appealing to the parents of the children it's been designed for.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"That was so..., WICKED!!" - the kid next door comments on his neighbors' version of neighborhood crimewatch law enforcement in "The Incredibles"<br /><br />One of the great films of 2004 is all animation and all kick-ass. No, its not "Shrek 2".<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is a great family film that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />This is also, & surprisingly, one of those films that you should see on the big screen & not on home video.<br /><br />Everyone knows what a superhero is. But, after saving a creep from his suicide attempt, Mr. Incredible & his fellow league of superheros are band by the Government from donning there supersuits & saving innocent citizens, forcing them to live, eternally, as there secret identities. This is only, of course, after the suicide creep wins a victorious lawsuit against Incredible for injuries in the rescue, as well as, invading the creep's privacy.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible still saves the day, only now as an insurance claims adjustor, saving the city's people, one claim at a time. His wife, Helen, aka, Elasti-Girl, plays housewife to her & Incredible's three kids, Dash, a youngster who lives up to his name, Violet, the troubled teen who can dissapear at will, & Jack-Jack, the youngest family member with powers that are, well, mixed to say the least.<br /><br />Basically, its the not-so Fantastic Five & a ho-hum life, with Mr.Incredible yearning for the hero fighting days of old, Helen reminding him to live in & get used to the now, & breaking up the regular fighting between Violet & Dash, if they could just catch either one of them.<br /><br />Things start to pick up when a secret transmission message is found in Incredible's work briefcase telling him that there is a secret mission for him if he wants it & the reward is triple his usual yearly income, if he decides to take it.<br /><br />What Mr. Incredible doesn't know is that sinister forces are at work and its all a trap, led by a youngster who is Incredible's #1 fan.<br /><br />I was constantly reminded throughout most of this year that this movie was coming to theatres on Nov. 5, 2004, thanks to the trailer that you can not avoid on the "Finding Nemo" DVD. But, it was well worth the pay off (the film will probably be the big movie for the Xmas season right along with "The Polar Express").<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is basically, bits of the Marvel Comic "The Fantastic Four" with a dash of Disney, with PIXAR animation & humor. All of the characters are great and well thought-out.<br /><br />The animation is top notch with new advances that leap off the screen (especially, during the action sequences).<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if "The Incredibles" walked off with the best animated film Oscar of '04.<br /><br />Its that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Time will tell.  A work of magic.  Honestly I think Brad Bird must be a magician to have crafted something so beautiful and subtlely complex.  I am in awe of this Pixar creation.  Best film they have done so far by a longshot.  Everything about it is perfection.  Can't say enough good things about it except to say anyone who says Shrek is better than this needs to get a life and a brain.  It is also in my opinion better than most of the superhero films we have (i.e. xmen, spiderman etc...)See this film if you want to remember what it feels like to be truly entertained by a moviegoing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Super heroes are real and possess great powers.  But their actions have become unpopular.  The government finds them too costly to support in the wake of continued lawsuits and has set up a program to hide them from society.  Two such heroes are Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl who have gotten married and had kids.  But Mr. Incredible misses the old days and occasionally sneaks out with an old friend (Frozone) to right wrongs in secret.<br /><br />But then Mr. Incredible is contacted to help stop a powerful robot.  The action gives Mr. Incredible a new lease on his self worth and things begin to look up for him.  But eventually his exploits get him in trouble in a big way and his family gets involved.  First they are just trying to rescue him and then they need to rescue civilians in a plot similar to one used in Astro City.<br /><br />The story and action are excellent.  Combined with a powerful music score, the film often feels like the best of the James Bond films.  A great cross between the superhero story and the secret agent story this story really moves and has real character development.  Overall the film is less intense than Finding Nemo with fewer scary moments and surprisingly little violence.  The scenes of superheroes trying to be mundane are excellent.  A wonderful cast of voices completes the mix and creates a movie that is fun for most ages.<br /><br />I watched the short Jack Jack Attack before the main film and I think it works well that way.  Also included is a wonderful little film called Bounding that can be watches over and over again.  Some deleted scenes, interviews, character bios and other things round out this edition.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVNA57PI4DLV.html">ACVNA57PI4DLV</a><br/><p>Wow ! What an incredible animation movie from Pixar. It is just full of wit, superb settings and animation, an eye for detail, and works at all levels. Most of the humour in The Incredibles lampoons the "superhero" concept and how it would translate in real life, with the constraints of daily life, aging, social interactions, and so on. It also sends up spy movies almost as extensively. There is a sequence where Mr. Incredible distracts guards by throwing a giant rock at one of them, which is just precious.<br /><br />If there is one thing wrong with The Incredibles, you could say it is the ideological underpinning. Basically, the movie takes a positive attitude towards the idea that the Incredibles are "special people" and that trying to reproduce their powers through technology and giving them to the masses is evil. It's hard not to make an analogy with gun control and elitism of the worst kind, much like what has been leveled against Star Wars from some quarters.<br /><br />In the end, though, it becomes pretty irrelevant in the top-notch and inspired visuals, the jokes that almost always strike true, and just the wealth of ideas in there. Everything rings true. The only movie comparable to it is The Iron Giant, made by the same director. Now if only we could get more animation like this...</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Comic book superheroes are basically vigilantes who usually operate outside the law, although certainly many of them have associations with law enforcement authorities (e.g., Batman the Batsignal, Hellboy and the F.B.I.).  Some of the best comic book stories of recent years, such as Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" and Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons' "Watchmen," have explored the idea of what happens when society decides to get rid of its superheroes.  Actually, they have dealt with what happens when the banned superheroes come back, which is the subject of Pixar's latest triumph, "The Incredibles."  The difference, of course, is that whereas "The Dark Knight Returns" is tragedy, "The Incredibles" is more of a farce.  Besides, whereas Batman has pseudo-familial relationships with Alfred and the latest Robin, the Incredibles are a two-generation family of superheroes.<br /><br />We begin before the end for the superheroes of this world as once again they are called upon to save the day.  But this is a world where no good deed goes unpunished because there is always a lawyer around to make sure of that.  The next thing we know, we have jumped ahead to a world without superheroes, or, more specifically, a world in which superheroes are trying to live ordinary lives.  But Bob Parr a.k.a. Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is having a hard time because there are just so many good deeds out there begging to be done and people to be rescued from burning buildings.  Meanwhile, his wife Helen a.k.a. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is trying to lead a normal life raising their three paranormal children, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and baby Jack Jack (Elie Fucile & Maeve Andrews).<br /><br />On "Bowling night" Bob and his best friend Lucius Best a.k.a. Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) sit around and talk about the good old days, and sometimes engage in a little undercover superhero work.  This has not gone unnoticed and when Bob learns that there may be a place for Mr. Incredible in the new world order, complete with a new costume courtesy of Edna 'E' Mode, he is more than willing.  Now, all he has to do is hide his new "job" from his suspicious wife.  Meanwhile, just because the superheroes have all been retired does not mean that the villains are playing by the same rules.  As Mr. Incredible points out at the start of the film, "No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again."<br /><br />The superpowers of the characters in "The Incredibles" are pretty basic.  Mr. Incredible is basically Superman stripped down to strength and invulnerability (or Wonder Man if you read Marvel instead of DC), Elastigirl is a female version of Plastic Man/Mr. Fantastic, Violet has both of the Invisible Girl's powers (i.e., Invisible Kid + Kid Psycho), Dash is super fast like the Flash/Quicksilver, and Frozon is Ice Man without turning into a walking icicle.  As for Jack Jack, let us just say that the final report on the tyke is not in yet (i.e., Franklin Richards squared).<br /><br />Director Brad Bird has parlayed his traditional animation efforts "Family Dog" and "The Iron Giant" into this computer animated Pixar film.  "The Incredibles" avoids the question of where did the first generation of superheroes come from, so there is no concern with visitors from a strange planet or bites from radioactive spiders, and few will ponder the reproductive niceties of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl reproducing (remembering the "Elsewhere" story where Lois Lane died when the superbaby started kicking will help sober you up).  Bird keeps the rules simple, you accept the premise, and go along for the ride.<br /><br />The key thing about this ride is that it is both fast paced and creative.  My favorite sequence is when the family is in danger and Violet needs to step up to the plate and use her powers or else they are all going to be dead.  You know what is supposed to happen at this point, but it does not happen, and if you do not end up thinking that Elastigirl is the most competent superhero in this film then you are just not paying attention.  I also liked the discussion on villains "monologuing" (remember the "SNL" panel discussion involving James Bond villains?) and the jump cut on the car toss scene at the end was very cool as well.  "The Incredibles" is, of course, a comedy, but it takes itself seriously, which is why it ended up being rated PG and why this one is a keeper for comic book fans of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>The world used to rely on superheroes to protect us.  But when their powers started hurting people, they were forced to go into hiding and only be known by their secret identity.<br /><br />Fast-forward 15 years, and you get the Parr family.  Bob (Mr. Incredible) is a claims agent at an insurance company.  Helen (Elastigirl) has really taken to the roll of full-time wife and mother.  And they have three kids.  Violet is a teenage girl who can turn invisible and create force fields.  Son Dashiell can move extremely fast.  Then there's baby Jack-Jack.  He might just turn out to be the only normal one of the family.<br /><br />One day, Bob gets a secret message about an island that needs his help.  Since he hasn't adjusted at all to living a normal life, he secretly heads out.  What he doesn't know is that it's a trap.  Now the entire family will have to come together to survive this crisis.<br /><br />This movie works on a couple different levels.  There's the action, of course.  The main storyline moves quickly and entertains in spades.  Then there's the other stuff.  The people at Pixar did a good job of creating normal family situations for their super hero characters.  Violet and her powers especially are the perfect match.  And the scene with the parents arguing over how to get to the villain's machine while traveling at super speeds down the freeway is hysterical.<br /><br />And that's the great thing about this movie.  It moves with ease from family drama to action to comedy without missing a beat.  Because of the super hero storyline, small kids won't enjoy it as much as previous Pixar offerings.  But the rest of the family will find it highly entertaining.<br /><br />Once again, Pixar shows that it knows how to do DVD right.  Disc one of this two-disc set contains the movie in widescreen with full surround sound.  Transferring directly from the digital source, it looks and sounds great.  There are two great commentaries for this movie, one with director Brad Bird and Producer John Walker - the other with several key animators.  Disc two features behind the scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and a couple of shorts.  "Boundin'" played in the theater before the movie.  "Jack-Jack Attack" is all new, and features the story of what Jack-Jack was up to that created all those frantic phone messages we heard near the end of the movie.  There is a brief segment called "Incredi-Blunders," but don't be deceived.  It's mistakes in rendering and not bloopers like Pixar used to do.  (BTW, anyone besides me miss them?)<br /><br />This film is great fun and extremely deserving of its recent Oscar win.  Pixar has another winner on its hands.  I hope their winning streak continues for quite some time to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This was better than I thought it would be. Being all CGI gave the film makers unlimited freedom as to what they could do unlike other superhero movies which use live actors. The animation in this movie is just beautiful and sometimes photorealistic. At times, the animated characters faces look real. The only problem I had with this movie was there was a certain lack of emotion needed to really make you care about the characters. But other than that, this movie is a feast for the eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>Not only was this a great movie. But the DVD extras just blow you away. I really enjoyed the character interviews as well as the bloopers. This is a must get not only for yourself but the kids as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>I want to know what the people at Pixar are taking?  They constantly keep releasing amazing visual and smart written movies.  Plus they keep doing movie that are themed around ideas that have never been done.  Toy Story contained talking toys in their own little world.  Monsters Inc. was about a company that hires monsters to scare children at night.  Then theres The Incredibles.  A movie about a family of retired superheros that have to save the world again, fifteen years into their retirement.  And with this entry, Pixar have made their best movie yet.<br /><br />The movie is about superheros, of course, that are forced into hiding when constant law suits are filed against them from people who either don't want to be saved or have suffer heavy financial loss from damaged personal property on behalf of the superheros.  So Bob Parr, a.k.a. Mr. Incredible, is forced to go work for an insurance company, working in a cubicle that is almost the same size as him (I could sense the reference to Office Space).  He is bored with his life and always thinks about the glory days when he was fighting crime and saving the day.  He goes home every night to his family: His wife Helen, Mrs. Elastic, his son Dash, who can run super fast, his daughter Violet, who can make herself invisible and can create a unbreakable force-field, and his son Jak-Jak, who is the only "normal" one in the family.  Occasionally Bob will sneak out with his friend Frozone (voiced brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) to go listen to police radio to try to stop a crime.  One day Bob receives a mysterious invitation to go stop an out-of-control robot and a job offer to be a persons personal superhero.  He gets captured by his hirer, Buddy.  Buddy was the president of Mr. Incredible's fan club when he was a kid, and was always ignored by Mr. Incredible.  Now Buddy wants to be a superhero himself, Syndrome.  So Mr. Incredible's family has to send out on a rescue mission to find him and stop Buddy's evil plan.<br /><br />First of all, the graphics in this movie are amazing.  Pizar keeps outdoing themselves with every release.  This movie was by far their best.  The voice talents were very good and believable.  I especially like Jackson as Frozone and Craig T. Nelson's booming voice made for a good Mr. Incredible.  The storyline in this movie was a little more advanced than previous Pixar movies.  This one involved marital problems between Bob and Helen.  The kids were having problems fitting in with the other kids at school.  And of course, a villian trying to take over the world.  Also people died in this movie, which is unprecedented for Pixar.  So maybe this movie leaned a little more to the older kid demographic.<br /><br />Overall this movie was the best I've seen this year.  This movie may even be the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.  Everything is just beautifully meshed together to create an almost perfect movie.  It is visually stunning, voiced powerfully and very smartly written.  I guess my one word review for The Incredibles would be...well, INCREDIBLE.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>Pixar Animation Studios produced another brilliant and superbly animated film in 2004 entitled "The Incredibles".  Beginning several decades earlier, the story begins in an age when many superheroes were saving lives and stopping criminals and were highly respected by law enforcement and the general public.  However, this thankful climate changed when people who had been injured began to sue the superheroes for injuries incurred during one their attempts at rescuing.  Three such superheroes were Mr. Incredible (a.k.a. Bob Parr; voice of Craig T. Nelson), his wife Elastica (a.k.a. Helen Parr, voice of Holly Hunter) and Frozone (a.k.a. Lucius Best, voice of Samuel L. Jackson).  To stop the numerous lawsuits and damage, the government decided to force all of the superheroes into retirement and to place them into a program to keep them hidden.  Of course, they were not permitted to use their superpowers anymore, even though that is exactly what they all wanted to do.  After many years, Bob & Helen Parr had three children: the oldest a daughter named Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), the next oldest a son named Dashiell 'Dash' (voice of Spencer Fox) and the youngest a baby named Jack Jack (voices of Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews).  The Parr family does its best to live normal lives, but Bob is really miserable in his job, especially because of his very unpleasant boss.  He yearns to relive the good old days of saving people and one night, while he and Lucius are looking for someone to save while listening to a police scanner in a car, they are being watched.  The person watching them is a woman named Mirage (voice of Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a), who works for a mysterious man named Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee).  She offers Bob a chance to use his abilities as Mr. Incredible and to be paid handsomely for it, but there may be an ulterior motive.  Another fun character is the superhero costume designer named Edna 'E' Mode (voice of Brad Bird).<br /><br />The quality of animation used by Pixar in creating "The Incredibles" is some of their most realistic work to date.  It is no wonder that "The Incredibles" won the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Sound Editing, and received Oscar nominations for Best Achievement in Sound and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  The film's story was one of the best that Pixar has ever produced (ranking right up there with "Finding Nemo" from 2003), and I wholeheartedly recommend it.  Overall, I rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Many thanks go to the numerous people that helped to create the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"The Incredibles" (2004) is a computer animated Pixar film in which a group of Superheroes have been sued and become a financial burden to the government. Before that Mr. Incredible and his girlfriend Elastigirl had a great old time fighting crime and evildoers. They and their super-ilk are exiled and put into a Superhero protection program. The government officer who sends Mr. Incredible into obscurity looks like ex-President Richard Nixon.<br />Later, after years of boring suburban life, Bob Carr, Mr. Incredible, is chafing to get back to work thwarting villains. He lives with his wife Elastigirl and three kids who also have superpowers that they have to keep hidden.<br />Bob is a very real and believable. He's a superhero with a lot of human flaws. He's a klutz, none too bright, overweight, and he's a henpecked husband; wife Elastigirl is a nag. It's ordinary family life: their kid, Dash, gets sent to the principal's office for misbehavior involving his super speed.<br />Bob serves as an insurance adjustor and has to put up with a nasty little boss. He's a husband who fears his boss and has a long-suffering wife. It's like an old-fashioned situation comedy where the father is a schlemiel Dagwood Bumstead type.<br />The office cubicle scenes are very well-done. Bob favors the customers and eventually gets fired. The scene where the diminutive fashion designer makes him a new costume is funny and clever. He is lured back into service as a superguy fighting for humanity to stop a menacing force that is out for world destruction.<br />When he was an active Superhero, Mr. Incredible had failed to encourage Buddy Pine, a Superhero-wannabe, who has now devolved into the evil super-villain mastermind Syndrone with superpowers of his own. He becomes Mr. Incredible's nemesis. Superheroes are being knocked off by Syndrone.<br />It congeals into a James Bondish film (remember this is all animated cartoon stuff), an action flick where good guys are fighting the superbad guys on an island. The action sequences may thrill the kiddies, but parents will have to stifle yawns. "Oh, this stuff again." The film is overly long, and the tedious action sequences aren't highly original.<br />The movie if full of satiric touches, but it's too drawn-out, and needs tighter editing.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Successful animated films such as Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story are a number of films that Pixar Studios has made during the last decade.  This time Pixar releases another hit, Incredibles, which brings an important social issue to the silver screen for the whole family to enjoy in witty, fast-paced, animated action comedy.<br /><br />Socially acceptable tendencies usually encourage people to behave in a manner of conformity, as negative responses from the community could possibly harm the individual if the individual does not conform.  Assimilation is the process adjusting with conformity to new information or situations.  This means that a person who changes his or her own unique identity does so in order to fit in with the majority.  On occasion, the majority forcefully pushes their values on the minority, which forces the small group to assimilate to the standards of the majority.  In essence, assimilation can be far worse than persecution, as the individual's identity could be erased to nothingness.  Incredibles applies this notion to superheroes, as they are forced to go into hiding and conceal their natural superhuman abilities.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has superhuman strength that he uses to save people and prevent crimes.  However, Mr. Incredible's superhuman strength gets him into trouble when he saves a person who tries to commit suicide.  It leads him and other superheroes into persecution, which forces them to assimilate into the society.  Mr. Incredible assumes his true identity, Bob Parr, a very unhappy insurance agent, without ever returning to the life of being a superhero.<br /><br />Some fifteen years later Bob still drives a small car back and forth from his job and home in a suburban neighborhood where all homes look identical.  At home his wife, Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), formerly known as Elastigirl, maintains the home as a homemaker, which includes raising three children.  Bob and Helen's children have also acquired superhuman powers, which they are not allowed to use since it could bring them trouble.  Nonetheless, it happens that they use their powers to get into mischief and other troubles at home.<br /><br />Bob breaks the monotony in life by hanging out with Lucius Best (Samuel L. Jackson) who used to be the superhero Frozone.  Together these two ex-superheroes sit and listen to the police radio, while occasionally acting on a distress signal without consideration for the consequences.  Helen finds out about Bob's nightly adventures and tells him to stop as it could bring more danger to the family.<br /><br />Out of the blue a woman approaches Bob and informs him that his special talent is needed.  Again without thinking things through Bob turns into Mr. Incredible, as he wants to do something to feel alive again and not feel trapped in the suburban tomb for the living dead.  This time the danger seems to be more dubious and more dangerous than what he has ever before encountered and he might need some extra help in order to defeat the evil that is coming his way through the villain Syndrome.<br /><br />The filmmakers at Pixar bring the audience a terrific cinematic experience through superheroes that are forced into hiding.  Incredibles deals with several issues besides assimilation such as coming of age, love, parenting, and much more.  These issues are brought to the audience through drama, humor, and suspense, which are depicted through some remarkable computer animation.  The film gives the audience an opportunity to burst out laughing and bite their nails in suspense while leaving the audience with an entertaining experience that will leave some pondering about the issues presented in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Pixar's name on a movie is almost a promise of quality, and this movie keeps that promise.<br /><br />It's about your basic, everyday family of superheroes living out their basic, everyday secret identities. After some ugly legal problems, their supering days are over. As cramped and constraining as those idenitites are, they are the only identities left. Then, at the peak of Mr. Incredible's mid-life crisis, the call comes from a mysterious source, and --<br /><br />Well, a lot happens, but you'll see that for yourself. Pixar gives good reason to sit through it, more than just Edna, Mirage (a Storm look-alike), and the self-declared Incredi-boy. Mr. and Mrs. Incredible have a lot to deal with, as in any marriage, and the super life is the least of it.<br /><br />The older children, Dash and Violet, are good characters, but a lot more could have been done with them. Violet, especially, is at an early teen age that can be very complicated, but breezes through it with surprising ease. I like the Incredible kids, but I would have liked more development of both characters.<br /><br />Oh, and yes. Keep watching. The littlest one does have "special needs."<br /><br />This is good, silly fun. It has characters worth caring about, and enough in it to be worth seeing again. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release of the movie</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson (The Skulls, Poltergiest), is one of the biggest super heroes around and his wife, ElastiGirl, voiced by Holly Hunter (Thirteen, A Life Less Ordinary), as well. They fight crime where ever they go but soon people dont want super heroes saving their lives anymore and soon they just become not wanted and they all become everyday citizens. 15 years later Mr. Incredible is working at a office company working for with this snotty boss, voiced by Wallace Shawn (Princess Bride, Clueless). What Mr. Incredible's wife doesnt know is that him and his friend, Frozone, voiced by Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 2) go out and fight crime. Soon, Mr.Incredible is back in action as he goes to visit a secluded island where there he meets a badguy named<br /><br />Syndrome, voiced by Jason Lee (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), who years ago was put down by Mr. Incredible. Syndrome has evil plans ahead. Mr. Incredible's wife and his kids, Dash and Violet soon come to rescue him. Pixar and Disney have done it again creating a fun filled adventure for the whole entire family and it plays off like a super hero movie as well. The characters are enjoyable especially the old lady who creates the super outfits. Elizabeth Pena (Rush Hour) voices the sidekick lady of Syndrome. A winner of incredible proportions though it's fun and exciting it isnt a masterpiece</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Incredibles has incredible art work. The images are great. The hair glissens in the water and the textures are great. The story is what makes the movie suffer. It's hardly funny and the begining is eally slow. Pixar has done better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I had extremely high expectations for this movie and it just did not live up to them.  I thought the movie was cute and it was funny.  But, I didn't feel it captivated me like the other Pixar movies did.  I would never discourage anyone from seeing this movie, because the people I went with loved it.  Yet, for me it was not what I personally expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>If you saw this, imagine it without the music. It'd lose a lot. We have a cartoon family of superheroes doing what superheroes do. Damn impressive cartoon technology, but so what? They're never going to be as convincing as human actors. So what do we do with this technology? Move it to the fringes where acting isn't so important, like talking animals, science fiction, fantasy, superhero stuff. TERMINATOR II was an awesome use of the technology, but what else is it good for? This movie is good if you're too exhausted to do anything constructive, like thinking, but I doubt any adult will sit through it twice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>I really wanted to love this movie, but I found alot<br />of it to be boring. So many people giving this movie<br />5 stars, is insane! Not enough superheros in it for<br />me, and Frozone was left out of most of the movie.<br />They always do a great job on the animation, but the<br />story as usual, not so incredible!</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>well,this family is in the fedreal witness relocation program hiding out due to their super powers.theres the dad who has super strength like the thing from the fantastic four.his wife has powers much like those of mr fantastic from the ff.she stretches and stuff.the daughter can create invisible shields a lot like the invisible girl from the ff.the son runs really fast like quicksilverv from .........hahaha....the x-men.but,oh well,i guess theres only so many super powers to go around.the dad secretly goes about helping out anyhow and the ol lady finds out.of course she intervenes and makes everything way worse.the kids even get involved.the characters and the portrayal of thier unique abilities is done fantasticly.[hahaha].the part i liked was the super fast son,zipping through the jungle to escape the bad guys.i know that does it little justice but its the best part.trust me.its really cool for the kiddies and is thankfully free from the poop,fart, and puke humor the kid movies are so prone to these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Few things in the world of DVDs are more predictable than making-of featurettes. Pixar, the 3-D animation outfit that loves to think different, does so in the making-of content for "The Incredibles." Energetic, visually adventurous and surprisingly edgy, the half-hour docu directed by Rick Butler distills the story behind the hit film about a family of undercover superheroes -- and unmasks the offbeat gang at Pixar that made it happen.<br /><br />Listen in: "Businessmen hate the film business" because they're gambling, not making widgets, producer John Walker says. Writer-director Brad Bird, an outsider, was "a strong cup of coffee" to deal with, one Pixar staffer reports with a nervous laugh. Bird says he was brought into Pixar because it really needed to be "shaken up a bit" -- and the Randy Newman music really had to go. Budget-minder Walker complains, "Whoever thought of making movies this way is out of his mind." Downright subversive by making-of standards.<br /><br />The docu is backed by an unusual "more making-of" section that tops 40 minutes, with chapters allowing viewers to pursue their interests, such as story development, lighting, sets or music.<br /><br />That's just the tip of Frozone's iceberg on the double-disc DVD of "The Incredibles."  Most of the content is worthwhile and non-repetitive. With the double commentaries mixed in, fans could kill a day taking in the extras. Or just a fulfilling half hour with the making-of.<br /><br />The Oscar-winning CG feature looks sensational in its pure digital-domain visuals. The letterboxed images set at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 keep the action tight (avoid the full-screen version). The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound boasts EX encoding and has plenty of punch, but as is typical with Disney-related DVDs, the rear soundstage feels a bit underused.<br /><br />One must-see extra is the lengthy black-and-white animatic of Bird's original opening, considerably darker than the finished intro. Like other bits in the movie, it feels like Sean Connery-era 007.<br /><br />The docu crew caught Bird and producer Walker testily doing battle over finances and creative priorities, but they'd made up by the time their commentary was recorded, just before the film was released. The men speculate about reaction to "The Incredibles," but, c'mon, they knew it was in the bag.<br /><br />A second group commentary with animators digs deep into animation theory and CG processes. Some of the illustrators Bird brought with him reflect on making the transition from traditional ("2-D") work to 3-D. The commentary menu contains an animated Easter egg, as do most of the other menus (wait out the music; watch for little creatures).<br /><br />Other winning extras include a DVD-exclusive short featuring the cute-but-creepy baby and his panicked babysitter; the theatrical toon "Boundin' " with a fun talk from its folksy creator; a handful of segments on the way-cool retro score and its old-school recording process (actual musicians playing live, without computers!); and a faux-dated TV cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone, who do a commentary but can't believe how stupid the episode is. Feel free to skip the character sit-downs with TV interviewers and the grating live short featuring the young woman who voices Violet Parr.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>It's rare that a movie lives up to its title. "The Incredibles" does precisely that by combining the excitement of the 60's Bond films, superhero epics and the dysfunctional American family. Taking place in a world drawn from the 60's (and how we viewed the future then), "The Incredibles" allows Brad Bird ("The Iron Giant") to pursue his unique vision as a film director. His style energizes the Pixar approach to animation allowing the studio to rival the more manic energy of Dreamworks while staying true to the character driven stories that make Pixar's films unique.<br /><br />When superheroes are driven underground by lawsuits, the "Supers" as they are called begin life as ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, the temptation of saving people seduces one of America's greatest superheroes Bob Parr/ Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) back into the ring of fighting evil. When a company contacts Mr. Incredible to help them stop a robot that has started thinking for itself on an isolated Pacific island Mr. Incredible resumes fighting evil despite the wishes of his superhero wife Helen Parr/ Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). With her two children (each of whom has their own unique powers) in tow, Helen goes after Bob believing that he's having an affair, or worse has gone back to fighting crime and risking their family in the process.<br /><br /> Another "Super" transfer from Disney and Pixar, the Academy Award winning "The Incredibles" really was one of the highlights of last year. The bright, vivid cartoon colors and sharp images create a convincing world for this family of superheroes. I found the transfer to be virtually flaw free and the resolution to be, well, incredible. Likewise, the active and imaginative soundmix remains a highlight on home video as well. This is an example of perfectly capturing the original theatrical experience as close as possible and transferring it to the home environment. The only thing missing was the commercials we see all too frequently (and which should be banned from theaters I might add), overpriced popcorn and giant boxes of candy you'll never be able to finish.<br /><br /> Once again we get an action packed group of extras on the second disc of this two DVD set. Two original shorts debut here. "Jack Jack Attack" shows exactly what happened to the babysitter during those horrified and frantic sounding phone calls to Helen/Elastigirl. It's just as funny as the feature. We also get "Mr. Incredible and Pals" a short cartoon that emulates those funky 1960's TV series (like "Captain Fathom" and "Clutch Cargo") where they used minimum animation, funky graphics and footage of real human lips matted on to the characters. It's corny and a lot of fun. This cartoon also has a tongue-in-cheek commentary track from Mr. Incredible and Frozone the two featured superheroes in the cartoon. The charming Pixar short "Boundin'" which played with the movie appears here as well. We also get deleted scenes and alternate an alternate opening sequence in various stages of completion. The alternate opening which is presented in its storyboard format features commentary by Brad Bird explaining what the thought process was behind the sequence and why it was abandoned. "Incredi-Blunders" features various animation mistakes that occurred during the making of the film. They vary from characters missing everything but their teeth, eyes and hair to uncoordinated sequences where the costumes are missing are move out of alignment with the characters.<br /><br />The first "Making of" featurette runs about 27 minutes and provides us with a comprehensive look into the difficulties Bird and his crew faced making the movie.  The second "Making of" featurette is composed of smaller parts provide information about the making of this great movie from conception to alternate storylines and the final product. Combined they run about 70 minutes.  We start with the story by Brad Bird with excerpts from Bird's video diary while writing the script, interviews during production and after. You'll understand why it takes a couple of years to create a film of this caliber.  Story Supervisor Mark Andrews shows us the storyboarding process and we see how he and director/writer Bird interact.  "Vowellet" who plays Violet in the movie discusses what she does on the side such as writing a history book "Assassination Vacation" discussing the assassination of various American Presidents. It's actually pretty funny and entertaining. "Making of The Incredibles" and "More Making of The Incredibles" gives us a glimpse into the creation of the various characters with the animators discussing the difficulty in making the characters come alive. We also get a glimpse into the various unfinished animatics, and the animation at various levels of creation. The "Music" portion of this 40 minute "featurette" is the most fascinating more me as the composer managed to recall the classic spy themes of the 60's and 70's without imitating them. We hear comments from the various musicians involved in the session along with the composer discussing the challenges and fun of making music of this sort with a glimpse into the scoring session. Brad Bird discusses the biggest challenge of the film-the scale of it which is not unlike a Bond film in terms of creating the environments. Brad Bird himself did the voice for Edna and it's pretty funny to hear the voice and see the character. Clearly the character combines Yoko Ono with Bette Midler and costume designer Edith Head and also manages to steal the film in every scene she's in. Bill Wise one of the technical supervisors discusses how difficult it was to create the characters for the crowd scenes.<br /><br />Brad Bird discusses how he immediately tried to subvert audience expectations in making "The Incredibles" and tried to make the film an unusual project from the very beginning. Bird sets up the opening sequence as larger than life (both in the golden hued color to the actions that occur) to contrast with Bob and Helen's life much later on. Bird reveals, for example, that Jason Lee played Buddy both as an adult and as a child altering the way that Lee spoke with Protools (a computer program that allows you to record and alter digital recordings) and by having Lee raise his voice half an octave. All sorts of fascinating bits from Bird and producer Walker crop up throughout the commentary from influences to visual tributes to other movies and mediums.<br /><br />The main animators discuss the difficulty in animating a much more physical film like an action-adventure movie. The amount of detail and types of motions are much, much more complex and forced the animators to develop new techniques and new software to make those moves realistic. The animators are also quite frank about the budget and time difficulties that they faced in creating the "universe" around the main characters. Evidently the animators used all the same models to create the background characters slightly manipulating the nose, chin and head here or there to create credible background characters that don't all look the same. They also discuss the variations from the actual storyboards and where inspiration struck (such as "Santa Claus is Coming to Town") as inspiration for certain sequences.<br /><br /> A great American film (not just a great animated film), "The Incredibles" got the deserved recognition with an oscar. It's the best, most intense and original CGI animated cartoons produced to date. It's also helped Pixar reinvent itself yet again by NOT duplicating previous successes. Bird demonstrated his special talents in the film "The Iron Giant" and he continues to break new ground in storytelling. Packed with a second disc of great extras, you'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about the making of this classic film. Here's hoping Bird will continue to break new ground and help keep Pixar fresh.</p></br></body></html>

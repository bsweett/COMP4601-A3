The movie, a political thriller set in Washington DC, was so uninspiring that I found it hard to put my thoughts into words. I guess the main point is you should not watch this movie for Keifer Sutherland. If you're a 24 fan, then you might be intrigued by this movie. It is one of Sutherland's few big screen appearances since becoming the star of 24. In Sentinel, Sutherland plays Jack Bauer without the motivation, the nuances or the common sense. You'll see nothing new in Sutherland. Eva Longoria plays his rookie partner. The movie needed a good looking cast member for a thankless, generic part, so they got someone with a name. Michael Douglass and Kim Basinger also star and they both are good in their roles and made the movie someone tolerable. In fact, I enjoyed parts of the movie and most of the cast was on top of their game, but the suspense and action scenes were clumsily put together and hard to follow.<br /><br />Michael Douglass plays a secret service agent assigned to First Lady. It seems he had a falling out with Sutherland concerning Sutherland's wife. The final line in the movie about Sutherland and his wife is cringe inducing and an example of incredible mediocricy in filmmaking. I can't really even recommend this movie as a rental. Perhaps you can check it out on HBO like I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>""The Sentinel" plays like a 108 minute episode of "Hawaii 5-0," minus the exotic locale (unless Toronto counts). It's fitting, because writer George Nolfi is also penning the upcoming "5-0" remake, but `70s cop shows are hardly the template one wants to use for compelling suspense. The slick production and decent direction (by "Homicide's" Clark Johnson) are sabotaged by plot holes you could fly Marine One through. When Garrison rabbits, for example." Pete Haar<br /><br />The plot lines of this movie were easy enough to follow. A disgraced Secret Service Man, Michael Douglas as Pete Garrison, tries to find the people who are blackmailing him. You see he is having an affair with the First Lady. The same First Lady he is hired to protect. Several secret Servicemen are killed and it is up to Kiefer Sutherland, as David Breckinridge, to find the source of the killings, and to investigate Garrison.  Alot of action filled sequences bring us to the Maryland shore where the one person who knows what is going on is mysteriously killed. Eva Longoria as a new Secret Service person is assigned to assist. She would play the love interest, except it seems, the movie's plot line has her being looked at as the 'sex object'. Could it be the low cut fitted pant suits she wears? In the end all is saved and everyone seems happy enough- though the dead kill seems to be mounting. The President is kept out of the action and appears to be clueless. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Adequate acting and a fast paced film keep this movie from sinking. A good movie for a long winter's night.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 2-14-07</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>The Sentinel contains parts of many other movies, most notably the superior In the Line of Fire, starring Clint Eastwood which was also about an assassination attempt on the President and the Secret Service agents who try to thwart it. The cast is very good -- Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland, Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger -- and the film is well written and directed. Douglas plays a secret service agent who is having an affair with the First Lady (Basinger). The secret service gets wind of an assassination plot that is to be carried out by a mole in the secret service. Douglas is accused of being the mole and must find the real traitor in order to clear his name and save the President. It's never boring and holds the audience's interest, but it's like a fast food meal you forget about right after you eat it. It seems as if Douglas has a clause in the contract of every film he does that he has to have an affair with at least one beautiful woman. Sutherland's agent is a close relative of Jack Bauer on 24. Basinger is beautiful as usual and convincingly portray's the First Lady vulnerability, but its same old, same old for her. Eva Longoria comes off very well as Sutherland's assistant. She clearly proves that she's much more than her sex kitten image from Desperate Housewives. However, most everything else is pretty standard. Overall, good, not great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Here Michael Douglas plays the agent that took a bullet for the president and now as an aging Secret Service agent, he must uncover an assassination plot. Fans of "In the Line of Fire", "Enemy of the State", and the "24" TV series should enjoy this fast moving actioner. At first I thought this is another "In the Line of Fire", but the story was different and I actually enjoyed it more even if once again I thought this guys is to old to be secret service.<br /><br />Good cast, sets, directing, and story make this a good one for most the family. The rating suffices it to say there is some adult situations and language. Although you can't help thinking Clint Eastwood and Michael Douglas are to old to playing active agents, you have to give them credit for doing their best. I would be interested to know the mandatory retirement age of agents guarding the president. It unlike many jobs should not be handcuffed by age discrimination. I say that as a member of AARP.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>A pleasant surprise, all too rare at the movies today.

I believe that show is one of the greatest action packed hours of television you can find at the current time.  After watching Kiefer Sutherland promote the Sentinel like it was going to be similar to 24, my expectations were pretty high to say the least...<br /><br />and what we got was a below average action flick that didn't really feature as much action as I hoped.  The first 45 minutes of the film positively dragged.  The idea was to build suspense, but it didn't work in my opinion.  Kiefer's character was on the same awesome level as usual, though.<br /><br />Michael Douglas could have been better.  His character was convincing, but just barely.  The movie seriously doesn't live up to the hype.  Watch the TV show 24 instead to show the proper way to glue viewers into a plotline.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Sentinel brings to the screen the story of a Secret Service agent who is framed for allegedly plotting to kill the President.<br /><br />Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland (!!!) carry out their performances well, though Eva Longoria, who is otherwise wonderful in Desperate Housewives, not to mention gorgeous, does not really "belong" in this movie.<br /><br />The acting and the music are pretty good, while the plot and the dialogues by being unoriginal and rather uninteresting are average and sometimes below average (been there done that...).<br /><br />In a nutshell, The Sentinel is like a mediocre episode of 24, therefore, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The story revolves around a Secret Service Agent, Pete Garrison  (played by Kirk Douglas) who is aging, but also having an affair with the President of the United States Wife, played by Kim Bassinger.  Twenty years ago he saved a president's life by jumping in front of a bullet.  In the opening scenes it is established he is a respected and has camaraderie with the Secret Service Presidential team.<br /><br />So after his friend, Merriweather is shot and killed at his house the secrets of all come forth in the plot.  The killing looks like a botched robbery, but it is soon established it was made to look that way.  David Breckinridge (another Secret Service Agent played by Kiefer Sutherland) is a great detective and investigator.<br /><br />All this unravels to be a secret plot by an "insider" to assassinate the president.  This astounding revelation stuns the team as it has never happened before.  Somehow they begin to suspect Garrison, who is being framed.  Garrison knows he is a weak link because he is hiding a monumental secret, an affair with the first lady.<br /><br />The film drags on the last half with gunfights and chases, and the plot seems familiar in many ways to Manchurian Candidate and other Presidential who-dun-its...</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Sentinel (Clark Johnson, 2006)<br /><br />Back before this movie came out, I was a little confused-- it got very little marketing for a movie with a cast as respectable as this one has. Well, now I've seen it, and I think I know why-- I'm guessing Fox, once it saw the finished product, was a bit reluctant to release it. That, or embarrassed. Clark Johnson (probably best remembered for his acting-- he played Meldrick Lewis on the wonderful Homicide: Life on the Street) is very good at directing for the small screen-- he's done some great work on The Shield, including the pilot episode-- but as his big-screen adventures have shown, it's not translating well.<br /><br />The plot, for those of you who missed it in the trailers: Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas), a decorated Secret Service member, is accused of being a mole. His former best friend, David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland), is pursuing the case with, shall we say, a good deal of overeagerness thanks to a fallout between the two some years before. Meanwhile, the real mole is planning something dastardly having to do with the President (United 93's David Rasche).<br /><br />Much of the movie's lackluster pace and overall silliness can be pinned on scriptwriter George Nolfi (whose previous claim to fame was Ocean's Twelve; need I say more?), but its disheveled appearance is all on Johnson. You'd think someone who can make The Shield almost palpably slimy would be able to work with this stuff. And I've never quite figured out why it's so tough for successful TV directors to make the switch to the big screen, but The Sentinel provides more evidence for the hypothesis that it's so. **</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>The purpose of the United States Secret Service is to protect the lives of the President and his family at all costs.  They are a group of people that many Presidents have trusted with their lives for many years, and for many more to come.  There has never been a traitorous agent in all the years the Secret Service has existed, until now.  At least that is the premise for the movie "The Sentinel", starring Keifer Sutherland and Michael Douglas.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" begins with the Secret Service dealing with the standard, every day threats that the President receives on his life.  But when a plot on the President's life appears to involve a traitorous Secret Service agent, and the evidence points to one of the most decorated agents in the service, Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas), this threat becomes anything but standard.  As two federal investigators (Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing all the facts and zeroing in on the traitorous agent, the only thing Garrison, who knows he is being framed, can do is go on the run and try to prove his innocence by finding those responsible.<br /><br />Let me say that the premise of the movie is one of pure fiction, there has never been a traitor within the Secret Service, the men and women that serve in this job continue day in and day out to put their lives on the line to protect one man and his family no matter the cost.  With that being said, lets move on to my thoughts on the movie at hand.<br /><br />When I saw the trailers for this movie, I instantly wanted to see it.  For two reasons, 1) I was a fan of Keifer Sutherland's work on Fox's hit show "24", and 2) the story seemed intriguing and looked like it would be a really solid action movie, with a good mystery thrown into the mix.  Now that I've finally watched the movie, I have to say that I thought it was really well done, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  All of the actors did excellent jobs, Michael Douglas even surprised me with how physical he was for as old as he is.  Keifer Sutherland turned in a solid performance, though this role didn't test him much, since he was essentially playing his character Jack Bauer from "24".  Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger rounded out the main cast, and both managed to do very well with not a whole lot of screen time.  The story was very well put together, with plenty of suspense to keep things interesting, and the mystery element was a nice touch to shake things up a bit.  Although the final reveal of who was behind the whole thing wasn't all that big of a surprise for me, I had the character pegged fairly early on.  Even though I had a strong suspicion as to who was the traitor, that didn't bring the movie down for me at all.  This may have been helped by the amount of detail that was shown as to what the Secret Service must go through every day to ensure the safety of the President and his family, which was really interesting to witness.<br /><br />I'm sure after watching this movie that any President, past, present, or future, will be very appreciative of the loyal service provided by these good men and women, but they may also be a little suspicious that one of them may betray them someday.  It's a scary thought, but a realistic one, when you know someone else is holding your life and the lives of your loved one in their hands.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Kiefer Sutherland's Toronto gets a feature when the American President is almost taken down near City Hall. Keifer Sutherland is one of the best sleuths with the American Secret Service. His former best friend and mentor is having an affair with the First Lady and now framed for attempted treason. While Douglas tries to clear his name... the Secret Service must heighten efforts to protect the Commander in Chief.  Sure its Agent Bauer from 24 on the big screen but it's cool to see a rouge agent break into the Metro Toronto Police Headquarters just by flashing his badge despite a US Federal Warrant out for his capture.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) has spent his whole life working for the Secret Service.  He's risen through the ranks, and his current job is head of the First Lady's (Kim Basinger) security detail.<br /><br />Complicating his life, he and the first lady have fallen in love and are having a secret affair.  Someone has found out, however, and sent the incriminating pictures to Pete.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Walter (Raynor Scheine), a former informant of Pete's, tells him someone is planning to kill the President (David Rasche).  When the little intel that Walter was willing to part with proves true, the Secret Service springs into action.  They have a mole in their department and need to find him or her before the murder takes place.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the clues begin pointing to Pete.  Internal investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland) is convinced Pete's the mole.  Pete has no choice but to take off and find the truth himself.  But can he do that without being arrested?<br /><br />I'll admit, I was lured to see this movie based on TV advertisement placement.  I am a huge fan of the show 24, and this movie looked like it could be similar.  Plus it starred that show's Kiefer Sutherland.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie didn't live up to my high expectations.  The story is weak.  Things came to the main characters, especially Pete, way too easily.  I like seeing characters search for the information they need.  Several pieces of information came so quickly, I had to guess how the character figured things out.  That's hardly good story telling.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the climax.  Several characters, including the villain, behave in completely illogical ways.  Additionally, one plot thread is dropped, giving no resolution to that aspect of the story.<br /><br />Since this is a thriller, I expected some tense moments.  While I will admit to jumping a time or two, most of the time I wasn't pulled into the story.  I cared about the characters, but the scenes that should have had me on the edge of my seat were rather ordinary.<br /><br />The thing that works in this movie is the characters.  The actors do a great job of making us care about what happens.  Michael Douglas is in most every scene and does a fine job.  Kiefer Sutherland gets to play the guy we're all hoping our hero can work around to save the day, a switch from his 24 character.  He's up to the part.  Not being a fan of Desperate Housewives, I hadn't seen Eva Longoria before, but she does a great job of playing the rookie caught between the two leads.  Finally, Kim Basinger makes a great First Lady.<br /><br />Another thing that sets this movie apart is the setting.  Not only do we get great shots of Washington, DC, but we get to see the inside workings of the Secret Service, something I had no idea about.  I found those parts of the movie fascinating.  Additionally, several scenes take place in the country, and the settings are beautiful.<br /><br />Honestly, this felt like half a movie, with scenes cut out from start to finish.  I'm sure if I'd been able to see the whole movie, this would have been great.  If you're interested, it's worth seeing, but wait for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>A mediocre, instantly forgettable espionage American government crime thriller, The Sentinel plays out more like a trumped-up network television show than a fully-fledged motion picture crime thriller. This fractured, overly convoluted tale of a spy within the Secret Service who is trying to assassinate the President is so laughable and implausible that you'll end up being cynically amused at most of what goes on.<br /><br />The movie is totally dumb, and gets even dumber as it goes on. Michael Douglas - who indeed seems to be fighting the hands of time - plays Special Agent Pete Garrison. A few years back, he slept with the wife of his best friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland). Now he's having an affair with first lady Sarah Ballentine (Kim Basinger).<br /><br />When Pete receives incriminating photos of himself and Sarah he realizes he's being blackmailed. At the same time he also learns that there's a "mole" working in the secret service plotting to assassinate the president. Things go really haywire when he realizes that someone's trying to frame him as the perpetrator.<br /><br />Beaten into a corner and in danger of being charged with treason, Garrison goes on the run, partly in order to clear his name and also to hopefully uncover the real architects behind presidential assassination plot. But Breckinridge stays hot on his tale, chasing his former pal with the gorgeous rookie (Eva Longoria) who adds a bit of glamour to the chase. (Eva Longoria as a Secret Service Agent?).<br /><br />Unfortunately The Sentinel doesn't really work that well. Apart from that fact that you can figure out whom the mole is after about twenty minutes, director Clark Johnson allows his pursuit scenes to run on for far too long. Most of the action is made up of a lot of gratuitous running, crouching, skulking around corners, aiming guns and shooting them. This of course gets a bit boring when carried on for so long.<br /><br />Johnson uses jerky camera work to heighten suspense and to make the film look a little more prestigious that it really is, but this ends up being annoying instead. The same can be said about the film's overpowering background music as well as its choppy editing. And are the Secret Service really this efficient and on top of things in the real world? When you think of how the government has handled recent tragedies, something tells me they're not.<br /><br />The Sentinel becomes even more preposterous as it lurches along. The rationale behind the assassination plot is murky at best. And then there's the big, hugely far-fetched shoot-out at the close, which suggests that infiltrating a small army of gunmen into an international assembly that is supposed to be a G8 summit must be the easiest thing in the world to do. It's also never really made that clear whom the gunmen actually are, but at least the scenes are shot in Toronto so we get to see some of the City.<br /><br />The movie gradually sinks into a pit of conspiracy clich&eacute;s, from the D.C. detective who talks like he's from a Manhattan borough to Pete's unkempt on-the-street informer who seems to know everything. Even worse, the characters lack in-depth development. It's also criminally sloppy writing when towards the end of the movie Sutherland's Breckinridge changes his attitude towards Garrison for the flimsiest of reasons.<br /><br />The performances are pretty much what you see is what you get. Douglas goes through his usual tight-lipped shtick - you would think after thirty years in the business he'd be stretching himself and taking on more interesting roles. Sutherland does his TV show spiel and Longoria - who is never going to the world's greatest actress - is wasted in a role anybody could have phoned in. And Basinger looks svelte and gorgeous but offers little beyond her appearance as a meek and decorous First Lady.

When an off duty Secret Service Agent is gunned down outside his home, talk begins to circle about a plot to kill the President and a potential MOLE among the Secret Service. So, when SSA Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) fails a polygraph, the heat is not far behind.<br /><br />All sounds very intriguing, and it is, but the problem is with the delivery. Watching the film, it seemed like an entire season of 24 crammed into a 2 hour movie. There was SO MUCH going on. Bad guys. Possible bad guys. Moles. Possible moles. Affairs. Suspected Mole on the lamb. Informants. Assassins. A shoot out in a public place. Murders. Secrets. It all seemed too choppy.<br /><br />The movie sort of has an empty feeling. People do heroic things, but they didn't grab my gut. Shocking things happen, but the movie is so hyperactive that you never truly get the desired feeling from it. Characters are established, but not really fleshed out... like Jill Marin (Eva Longoria). We meet her. We see how swift she is and why she has gotten this new job, but by the end of the film, we realize that she wasn't all that necessary cause she didn't do much.<br /><br />But the main gripe I have is the lack of exploration and explantion given to the BRAINS behind the assassination plot. You never truly feel the danger from them because you don't know them. Why are they dangerous? Why are they doing what they're doing? There personalities are only highlighted but not given enough attention.<br /><br />Finally, there are a couple of VERY questionable incidents involving the bad guys. Why would the assassin open fire in a crowded mall where everyone can see him? Not only that, but why would he instigate it? They didn't know who he was. What's he shopping for anyway? The second incident would give away too much of the ending, but the brains behind the operation seemed to leave his brain in the trunk when he got there.<br /><br />Then of course, there was the cheesy 80s music ending. I was completely expecting Michael Douglas, as he walked away from the capital, to jump into the air, kick his heels together with glee which would be captured in freeze frame glory.<br /><br />The SENTINEL could have been a good film. Kiefer Sutherland is his solid self, playing David Breckinridge, a variation of Jack Bauer from 24. Michael Douglas is real, sympathetic and solid. Yet, the rest of the characters are one dimensional, not unlike the story and the execution.<br /><br />It's not a horrible way to spend a couple of hours, but had I spent money to see this at the movie theatre, I would have REALLY been disappointed. I expected more than what we got with the talent that was involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Clark Johnson who has directed lots of TV shows including "The Shield," "West Wing," & "NYPD Blue" in addition to the film "S.W.A.T." was hired to helm this project.  He does an adequate job of keeping the action moving.  Following "Timeline" with Peter Walker & "Oceans 12," screenwriter George Nolfi's 3rd screenplay bears some of the problems why this film doesn't work completely.  The major problem is that Michael Douglas' character is part hero & anti-hero.  As a loyal patriot trying to protect the president, we cheer him on.  But as the two-timing adulterer who has an affair with the First Lady, we wonder how stupid he really is & how can a hero be morally inferior?  This is the crux for me of why it's hard to cheer for the film.<br /><br />However, given the material, Michael Douglas turns in a good performance as Pete Garrison.  It's been a long time since Douglas first broke on the scene with TV's "The Streets of San Francisco" & since his 1987 Oscar for "Wall Street."  He still brings a good studied intensity to the screen and gives a believable performance, while not really addressing why this man has character flaws that lead him to cheat on the president.  For the story's purpose, it is this vulnerability that leads to Garrison's compromise and pursuit to prove his innocence.<br /><br />Other actors also do a good job.  Kim Basinger who won her Oscar a decade after Doglas (1997) for "L.A. Confidential" does a good job as Sarah Ballentine.  She exudes a studied elegance that well suits a first lady, but again we fail to understand why she's so overcome with passion for Douglas.  Kiefer Sutherland who won the Golden Globe for TV's "24" in 2001 and has appeared in the movies in "Eye of the Killer," "Phone Booth," & "Taking Lives," does a good job as David Breckinridge who bears a grudge against his former best friend, but seeks out the truth.  Eva Longoria from "Desperate Housewives" on TV does a by-the-book performance as Jill Maren.  Blair Brown cameos as the press secretary.  David Rasche does a good job as a president.  His is a familiar face from films like "United 93" & "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."  All in all, this is an interesting evening's entertainment, even if it does not make you stand around and cheer afterwards.

Loads of action and a plot that doesn't completely slip into the absurd as is so often the case with modern movies.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays Secret Service agent Pete Garrison.  He is having an affair with the US President's wife (Kim Basinger).  This information comes to the attention of a group intent on killing the President.  Garrison is suspended from the service when he fails a polygraph test although this test is not directly related to the affair.

Just from the trailers, I knew who the real mole was and a lot of the really big moments are revealed there too. I mean, how much more suspense would have been gained by not showing the shooting-down of Marine One in the trailer? It would have generated a did-they-get-him moment for at least a few minutes, but this is the problem with most recent film marketing. They show too much in the trailers. As far as the film is concerned, Clark Johnson does a good job of directing and the performances are good, but it's a little too flat as far as some of the key players. Of course Douglas and Sutherland are good, but Longoria doesn't really have much to do other than stand around looking hot, and pretty much the same thing with Basinger. Martin Donovan, who is a brilliant indie actor, and has shown such in films like AMATEUR and TRUST, just seems very out of his element here. However, the biggest problem with this film is its villains. It is never REALLY revealed who they are, and it is not revealed AT ALL why they want to assassinate the President. All in all this film is really THE FUGITIVE meets IN THE LINE OF FIRE, which are two much better films. At its best moments, it works, but they're too few and far between for me to truly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Tough to go wrong with a Douglas/Sutherland vehicle.

David Breckenridge (Keifer Sutherland) and his new partner, a rookie, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria) are called in to investigate. David is a former best friend of Pete's and Jill was trained by Pete. An informant tells Pete there is a plot to assassinate the President. Soon David suspects Pete of the murder and the plot and Pete has to work on his own to uncover the mastermind behind the attempt to assassinate the President.<br /><br />"The Sentinel", directed by Clark Johnson, is an okay entry in the thriller genre. Certainly one of Michael Douglas' best efforts in a while (Mr. Douglas, see "Don't Say a Word" for an example of what NOT TO DO again), the film holds your attention for a while, but is rife with problems.<br /><br />From the moment the plot is revealed, there are basically three people who could be at the heart of the plot to assassinate the President. The film does a fairly good job of throwing doubt on all three. In fact, it does such a good job that the final revelation is a letdown. In fact, when we learn who is behind the plot, an earlier scene makes little sense. They seem to be sabotaging their own effort. Presumably, we are supposed to believe the characters is having second thoughts, but this isn't adequately conveyed. So typical. It would have been much more fun to have a more outlandish mastermind, someone who really stretched the credibility. That way, if the film did its work and provided all of the clues, we would have a very memorable exercise, something we could tell all our friends about. As it is, this is the type of film you would recommend to people who read every James Patterson novel and remark "It was pretty good. Almost as good as the last one". (Get it. They're all the same!)<br /><br />In fact there are many things which aren't adequately conveyed. In an early scene, as Pete is walking to work, he passes a protester who is protesting Bush and another war. Huh? The President in the film is named Ballentine. Is the protester caught in a time warp? This is an insignificant example, but it shows the type of attention paid to the story and the film.<br /><br />Douglas does a good job with the role. Pete puts his heart and soul into the job and we believe wholeheartedly he could never be the mastermind. While this is good for the performance, it also hinders the film. It removes yet another person from the equation. If Pete can't have done it, it leaves a smaller circle of suspects. As he goes about his job, we see the professionalism, the attention to detail he brings to everything. Later, when a secret is revealed about Pete, it makes his character all the more interesting. It simply proves he isn't perfect.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the television series "24" and it has resuscitated Keifer Sutherland's career. Unfortunately, I feel the character of Jack Bauer (from "24") is so memorable, that Sutherland is getting typecast in `Government Operative' roles. David Breckenridge is a softer, gentler government agent, but not by much. He has a bone to pick with Pete, because of some bad history, which causes him to pursue the leads like a rabid dog. He has a job and will let nothing, nothing stand in his way. The role is extremely similar to Jack Bauer, but Breckenridge does manage to show a little humanity. Very late in the film.<br /><br />Eva Longoria's first big screen appearance is a bit disappointing. Her character Jill Marin doesn't really play an integral part to the story. She seems to be included merely to give the male Secret Service Agents something to oogle at. When she first arrives at the White House, there is an ongoing interaction with one of Breckenridge's assistants. He can't keep his eyes off of her. It is an amusing touch, but it doesn't add anything to the story and seems an odd addition. Later, as the mechanics of the investigation get into gear, she becomes a true supporting character. "Jill, did you get those fingerprints." "Yes, they are a match". This is the type of interaction she is reduced to, as the two male leads are running all over the place, trying to solve the mystery. It is basically a role anyone could have played.<br /><br />Director Johnson does manage to keep the action moving. But throughout the film, he overuses a technique, wearing the effectiveness down. Early on, he starts shooting things as we might see them if we were on a surveillance team. A lot of long distance shots, through telephoto lens, with abrupt moves and zooms. It is interesting, but when the majority of the camera movements are done with this technique, it makes them less effective. It also jars us out of the story when we are constantly aware that there is a camera. The key to an effective film is when we feel as though we are a participant. If you draw attention to the fact that we are watching a film, we can't feel as though we are a participant. It feels like an exercise in filmmaking, not an exercise in storytelling.<br /><br />Late in the film, Breckenridge seemingly shifts his character 180 degrees and suddenly becomes Pete's ally. This shift is entirely unconvincing, because it happens so quickly and isn't sufficiently explained or detailed.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" is a mildly entertaining film, worthy of a bargain matinee or DVD rental. Much more than that and you will probably feel like you have paid too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>Michael Douglas trys hard as a secret service agent who appears to be framed. Kiefer Sutherland plays a co worker whos suspicious of him as he projects credible acting. Kim Bassinger as the typical frail, shaken first lady is a bore. That would basically sum it up. I was expecting more mystery and action and was disapointed on both. I can not find anything further to say about this film, and thats whats known as average. Destined for the back shelf . Oh, I came up with one more thing. The movie was full of camera jutting along with quick cuts in and out of scenes at an attempt to give big screen splendour. Great audio and picture quality .</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie serves as a sharp reminder of how paramount it is to the success of a film to have decent writers on board. I know it may sound like an utterly trite, common-sense lesson, but the fact that this movie turned out the way it did shows that there are people out there in Hollywood who have not yet learned. This movie had a really solid cast, a big budget, and an exciting premise. And yet, from beginning to end, viewers are served up forgettable characters with poorly-developed back-stories, going through the motions in a plot that never hooks their interest. I watched the whole movie and could care less about Michael Douglas's fugitive character. This one does not measure up to the level of The Fugitive (1993). It is definitely more on par with say, U.S. Marshals (1998).<br /><br />In fact, the only thing about this film that is worthy of discussion is which of its many facets was the most one-dimensional? There is a serious competition going on between: the main-character's relationship with the first lady, his feud with Keifer Sutherland's character, the secret plot to kill the President, the rookie agent played by Eva Longoria, and finally the question of which member of the Secret Service is a mole.<br /><br />The film's climax and subsequent resolution one finds boring, banal answers to all of those questions that they never really cared much about to begin with. The overall impact on the viewer was virtually non-existent. This movie was lighter than air.<br /><br />Overall, I think a 3 stars' is reasonable mark: the movie could have gone straight to the TV (as some other users say). There's not so much difference between this film and the ones you might see at home. `The Sentinel' is a forgettable thriller and there is absolutely no reason to recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It was a kind of surprise that Hollywood still keeps making a political thriller about the criminals engineering a conspiracy to kill the VIPs, and a super-human agent who almost single-handedly fights it. Luckily `The Sentinel' is a reasonably entertaining if not original thriller, far better than other flops like `Shadow Conspiracy.' Director Clark Johnson (`S.W.A.T') keeps the ball rolling, and the pace is fast enough to make us forget the countless plot holes and implausible motives of the characters.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, veteran secret service agent who once saved the life of President Ronald Reagan. After one of his colleagues gets killed, an informer reaches him, telling him that there is another assassination plan that is going on.<br /><br />Well, I can go on writing about the convoluted story, but maybe I shouldn't. There is an ex-best friend (and agent) played by Kiefer Sutherland in his `24' mood and he still wouldn't agree to bury the hatchet with Pete. There is a new recruit Eva Longoria in tailored suit who has not much to do in the story. Those who know something about the political thrillers can predict what will happen to each character, perhaps except one love affair involving the First Lady played by Kim Basinger, but that part looks sometimes out of place (partly because they altered the original book's story, which is more surprising).<br /><br />But the film itself is not bad. It keeps good pace, and the cast especially the lead Michael Douglas did a fine job. Usually I am not much interested in the assassination story - not because it is implausible, but too many films did that, didn't they? - but `The Sentinel' has a good rhythm that barely covers the impossibilities of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>Ok, ok.  Here we go.  24 is a.......what the heck did I just watch!  Oh, The Sentinel.  Okay.  Sorry it just reminded me of all those movies(which are better bye the way).  I was thinking of seeing this in theatres, thank goodness I didn't.  Its not really a bad movie, its just seems like its been done so many times before.  It was kind've like a special 1 and a half hour episode of 24, with a cool helicopter blowing up added in.  I'm just happy that Harrison Ford didn't join up on this project, Firewall was misguided, BUT I enjoyed that more than this, of course Ford is one of my favorite actors so I'm biased a bit.<br /><br />The acting was good, like I said before it was a bit like a made for TV movie.  It would be great to watch it on the SCI-FI channel or FOX, BUT for a movie that came out in theatres it was bland.<br /><br />Overall only rent this if you want to see Michael Douglas or are a huge 24 fan.  I, personally would rather watch Jack Bauer for an hour than this, but thats just me.....</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I expected a fun action thriller and this movie is a little too slow and sometimes even uninvolving. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland are still in good form though. Douglas plays a secret service agent who finds himself wanted after failing a lie detector test. The presidents life is in danger and he is a suspect due to failing the test. Meanwhile his secret affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger) could be a good reason why he failed the test. Sutherland plays a former partner and friend of his that is now after him to bring him in. Eva Longoria is good too as Sutherland's new sexy partner in training who also looks up to Douglas' character and doesn't like having to chase him.<br /><br />  Newsday gave both Firewall and the Sentinel * 1/2 stars saying that Harrison Ford and Michael Douglas are basically too old for roles that have them in action. I disagree though, especially about Michael Douglas. He's in great shape here and looks pretty good for his age. I guess this isn't that much of a new role for him though. I mean how many movies has he done where he's having an affair ? lol. Still though it's fun seeing this guy in action, no not the kind of action we see him in, in Basic Instinct lol. He's good here as a secret service agent, maybe not as good as Clint Eastwood in In The Line of Fire, but still really good. While Sutherland is such a good actor that he manages to not be too Jack Bauerish eventhough he's playing an agent trying to stop this or that from happening. He manages to have David Breckinridge  a bit different than Jack Bauer. He's not as ruthless, that's for sure lol. He's good here but I admit he has a stronger presence on 24.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>You'd think Michael Douglas would have learned his lesson by this time, but apparently he hasn`t.  For even after all the trouble he had with an adulterous romance in "Fatal Attraction," here he is in "The Sentinel" playing the role of Pete Garrison, a veteran secret service agent who's having an affair with none other than the First Lady of the United States.  Even worse, when it is discovered that there may be a mole secretly operating in the service, the finger of suspicion begins to point directly at Mr. Garrison.  Is he truly the undercover operative working to bring down the President, or is he merely a tool being set up as a convenient fall guy in a plot to rub out the nation`s chief executive?<br /><br />Based on the novel by Gerald Petievich, "The Sentinel" is a decent enough thriller set in the high stakes world of political assassination.  Although it frequently strains credibility, gets lost in a maze of cyber/techno mumbo jumbo, and succumbs to a few too many man-on-the-run cliches, the movie still manages to generate enough mystery and suspense to see us through most of its many rough patches.  Prime credit goes to Douglas, who after all these years, could clearly do these roles in his sleep, and to Keifer Sutherland, who plays a fellow agent with personal reasons for doubting Garrison's probity and loyalty to the institution.  Kim Basinger also does a fine job as the beautiful First Lady torn between duty towards her husband and the man she loves.<br /><br />You'll probably forget this movie the moment you walk out of the theater, but you should have a reasonably fun time while you`re still in your seat.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>The Sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, it's all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserving public.<br /><br />A plot about a Secret Service Agent planning to assassinate the Prez could well be entertaining. If handled by a good director or caring cast that is. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the First Lady, with whom he is having an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved plot contrivance). Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and...that's it. I guess there are less requirements for women when entering the Secret Service. As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a token and is very badly written.<br /><br />Clark Johnson's, he who gave us the equally as pathetic SWAT back in 2003, mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV-movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, the most over-exposed woman of the 21st Century, is basically only in this to attract to the Desperate Housewives audience. Her role is 100% pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development. She barely has 2 lines to rub together. A truly shameless marketing ploy.<br /><br />If you're a glutton for punishment then don't let me stop you. But is IS time and money you won't be getting back.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Trying to conceive of something as insipid as THE SENTINEL would be pretty difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes.<br /><br />Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who "took one" for Reagan during the attempt on his life. Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Troubles arise as we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady, and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails a polygraph test, he's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series).<br /><br />As the presidential assassination plot unfolds, Pete finds himself on the run from his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady, and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another (which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service?<br /><br />The one, big, overwhelming problem with this film is that there's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Isn't that what the movie's supposed to be about? One would think so! But the audience is never let in on why the assassin(s) want to kill the Prez. Hmm. Someone forget to put that in the script somewhere?<br /><br />And what's with David Breckinridge's (Kiefer's) new partner, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? What was her purpose again? Did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low-cut blouse?<br /><br />There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel as to be laughable. The action is too easily stymied by the "What the...?" responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"The Sentinel" isn't a movie I entirely expected to like, although I've wanted to see it since it was in theatres. Even though the plot is different, it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called "Firewall." Even while watching this movie, I thought it was similar to "Firewall" in many ways...But I also found myself entertained by it. Now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now; but a few good ones do come around. My favorite movie of this kind is "In the Line of Fire." It was entertaining, well acted, made sense, and was a great film. The Sentinel has good performances, it's entertaining, but it doesn't always make sense. It's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president. Even if they just want to do it to do it, they could've told us that. Inside Man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning. Anyway, Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who once took a bullet for Ronald Reagan. Years later, Pete is having an affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger) and is at odds with his former best friend David Breckinridge (a marvelous Kiefer Sutherland), also a Secret service agent. See David is under the impression that Pete had an affair with his wife. Anyway, through a rat, Pete discovers that there's a mole in the Secret Service who's helping terrorists plot to kill the President. At the same time, Pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and, as a result of that, evidence is piling up on the fact that Pete maybe the mole. Now with the entire Secret Service after him, including David and his new partner Jill (Eva Longoria, who's got some good acting chops away from Wisteria Lane). This movie has its share of cliches. There was a few times where I was watching this movie and thinking to myself "that sounds/looks familiar." I saw the end coming from a mile away. But, the ending quickly redeems itself (from my point-of-view anyway) with the relationship between Pete and the first lady not going in the direction you'd think. A lot of people won't like this film for reasons I've mentioned and more...But if you want some semi-mindless entertainment (although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws), then The Sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time. Due to its flaws, with only the fact that I enjoyed it to support my case, I should give it 4 stars...But I think that it's worthy enough of 5.<br /><br />Entertainment goes a long way.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>It's good to see Michael Douglas back onscreen and in top form as a morally and ethically flawed Secret Service agent Pete Garrison. And the movie that surrounds him is pretty good, also.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" is fast paced thriller about Garrison, his once best friend, fellow agent  David Breckinridge (a "24"-ish Keifer Sutherland), First Lady Sarah Ballentine (an at first tentative, then reactive and proactive Kim Basinger) and a plot, thought to be the work of a Secret Service Agent, to assassinate the President of the USA.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" rises or falls on Douglas' performance and he does his very best to keep us interested and he succeeds much of the time. Add to this the sharp, aware direction of Clark Johnson ("Swat") and "The Sentinel" adds up to good, intelligent entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>I had a good time with this one.

He's ageing comfortably well and spending his life in service to the office of the President as a personal protector to the First Lady.  Unfortunately, Garrison has also fallen in love with Sarah Ballentine and he's been compromised for some time.<br /><br />In short order, a plot to kill the president is discovered.  All indications are that the plot is coming from within the Secret Service.  They go on a mole hunt at the same time one of Garrison's confidential informers tells him about the mole.  Someone also knows about Garrison's affair with the first lady.<br /><br />After a few tense cat-and-mouse moments, Garrison is placed in the cross-hairs of the Secret Service investigation.  His one-time best friend David Breckinridge (Keifer Sutherland) comes after him with a vengeance because he believes Garrison had an affair with his wife.  Eva Longoria stars as new Secret Service recruit Jill Marin.<br /><br />The movie evolves into a series of chases and mystery-solving that runs tight and neat to the end, although it doesn't really break any new ground.  The movie is a great rental for movie night for both sexes that enjoy suspense stories with well-choreographed action sequences.<br /><br />I watched the Blu-ray version.

I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who the mole is and hoping that Garrison didn't get himself killed in his efforts to find the guy.

They revive the KGB to go back to the good old cold war model, but move them to Kazakhstan. Is it because the Kazakhs have built a pipeline to sell their oil to China instead of building a pipeline across Afghanistan and Iran and Irak to sell their oil to the US ? The president ot the USA is the most wanted president in the world at least by would-be terrorists and assassins. It is true that a fair number of US presidents have been assassinated or assaulted. But hasn't it always been by Americans, and even in this case it is said to be impossible without an American mole inside the secret services ? Forget it, man, the second cold war has just been declared by Hollywood. Of course the US president gets out of it unscathed. But the film becomes ridiculous when it states a sexual affair between the oldest of the security agents and the First Lady. Both ridiculous and absurd, including pictures of the sexual meeting between the two inside the First Lady's bedroom. That is really more than a mole. Why are our western countries suddenly so obsessed by heads of states and political fiction (three films and one TV series that I know of over the last three months, and I am not in the know of everything) ? Hollywood, and other western producers, would be very much inspired if they tried to take some distance from their political object if not objective.

Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) is a veteran member of the White House Security but has some problems: his ex-partner David (Kiefer Sutherland), convinced that Pete slept with his wife, is suspicious of Pete; Pete is having an affair with the President's wife (Kim Bassinger); Pete is pulled into dangerous territory trying to cover his secret and use a reliable old informer (Raynor Scheine) to give him clues; a new officer appears on the scene to accompany David and is a friend, Jill (Eva Longoria).  Once the evidence points to Pete as the planner of the assassination he is the victim of a chase, a chase that eventually uncovers the true insider perpetrator of the plot.<br /><br />The action is well paced and the actors make their roles as credible as possible.  One of the best parts of the film is the musical score by the very talented Christophe Beck who finally gets to demonstrate his skills as an orchestrator.  The fault of the film lies in the seemingly ignored fact that when well known actors are placed in a suspense movie and given very little to do except in the beginning, then the fact that they are in the cast points a big finger that they are going to be the true culprit - and that is very much the case here.  But for an evening's diversion the film provides some fine action work and the storyline is tense enough to hold your interest.

Then, when Douglas is blackmailed for having an affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger), I was totally hooked.<br /><br />From there, the film takes on a bit of the `No Way Out' (film with Kevin Costner)theme, and THEN becomes a noir version of The Fugitive with Keifer pursuing Douglas with Douglas being suspected as mole in a plot against the President. Thankfully, the writers decided Keifer wasn't a mindless drone and was able to figure out Douglas was framed.<br /><br />From there, it becomes a run against the clock to stop the assasination of the President.<br /><br />Any more info gives the movie away. Just trust me, I do NOT give good reviews to Hollywood pap like some reviewers who think good reviews get them on Amazon. You will enjoy this film. It is a top notch thriller.<br /><br />4 stars, only because I pictured Harrison Ford in Michael Douglas' part.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Check reality at the door and The Sentinel will entertain you for a good hour and forty-five minutes. It moves fast; it's suspenseful and very well acted and directed.<br /><br />There are two plot lines going on: A Secret Service agent is having an affair with The President's wife, and there is a conspiracy plot to assassinate The President. (This President is really down on his luck!)<br /><br />The film is well put together, but the whole idea that someone in The President's close personal Secret Service entourage could actually be turned as a spy, not just as an informant, but as an assassin's aide is...well...far-fetched.<br /><br />And that The President's wife could ever be out of the public eye or the Secret Service's eye long enough to start an affair is...well...just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />Plus you have Eva Longoria as a special agent which is about as believable as Pamela Anderson was as a Hollywood bodyguard in V.I.P. (1998 - 2002 TV series).<br /><br />That all said, The Sentinel was a good movie. I was entertained enough to want to keep watching without getting up for a break. Kind of like a Tom Clancy novel meets Desperate Housewives.<br /><br />Rent it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I expected to open up the intro page for this movie, and see over 100 reviews.  I thought this was a dead on classic thriller.  Granted, it helps to be a big 24 fan, as my wife and I are, but we loved this one!  I started to watch 15 minutes early, and could barely wait to have my wife come home from work and watch the whole thing with me, last Friday night.<br /><br />Keifer Sutherland and Michael Douglas make an awesome onscreen team. I also enjoyed Eva Longoria, but she felt like "flavor of the month" eye candy, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy her. And my wife are both Desparate Housewives fans, too, so that also helps.<br /><br />The story was a bit hackneyed with use, but I didn't think it was predictable at all, as the commentary tells us that having a mole in the Secret Service is just unheard of, having never happened.  I liked the freshness of having the story in Washington (I hate how all the 24's are in LA, like its so common the President spends his time there.  Why can't it be in Washington DC one season?) as this is where the president is most of the time, correct?  I loved Sledge Hammer, the show, and was glad to see the main character from that series as the President.  Very surprising, and unpredicatable.  He did a great job, I thought!<br /><br />I would recommend this movie, and if you're not sure, rent it like I did, before you buy.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />MC White said: Check it out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>This is a run-of-the-mill political thriller, and only the presence of Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland and Kim Basinger gets it as high as mediocrity. Michael Douglas plays Garrison, a secret agent whose inability to keep his pants on has cost him his best friend (secret agent Breckinridge, played by Sutherland) and compromised his position as head of security for the first lady (and he's the hero!). Some guys with various foreign accents want to murder the president and suspicion of being the mole in the secret service supplying them with information falls on Garrison. By an amazing coincidence, the agent chosen to bring in Garrison is Breckinridge. From then on the movie follows a pattern we've all seen many times before- Garrison fleeing, the secret service after him, the bad guys setting up a plot with the real mole, Garrison searching for evidence to clear himself and prevent the conspirators from succeeding in their vile machinations and the climactic gunfight at the OK Corral, or in this case Toronto City Hall.<br /><br />It's not a terrible movie, the action is exciting and the cinematography is good- some great views of Toronto, which was my home town for 25 years. The acting is excellent, as you'd expect from this cast. There just isn't any unexpected twist to lift it out of the ordinary. A DVD to watch when it's a slow night on TV, which is exactly when I watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>The opening scene of "The Sentinel", which shows the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, gives this movie a feeling of gravitas and importance.  Sadly, the direction and overall general production value of the experience fails to live up to that opening scene and instead produces little more than stock fare for this genre.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Sentinel" focuses on the Secret Service for the U.S. President (David Rasche).  When the head of the President's protection detail (Michael Douglas) is accused is being a mole, lead investigator Dave Breckenridge (Kiefer Sutherland) and his rookie partner (Eva Longoria) are called in to investigate.<br /><br />The simple reason this film was made was as a vehicle for the rising stars of Sutherland (who pretty much plays Jack Bauer of 24 in this film) and Longeria (sex symbol from Desperate Housewives trying to branch into more serious fare).  Douglas is thrown in for his personal background in political flicks.<br /><br />Thus, while there is most definitely enough ensemble acting talent to carry the movie, the story doesn't come anywhere near to supporting them.  The plot of "The Sentinel" is one that has been recycled time after time and adds nothing new into the mix.  The build-up is decent, but the execution leaves one wondering "is that it...really?".<br /><br />One bright spot, as usual, is the acting performance from Kiefer.  This genre suits him perfectly, and he could have been utilized even further (perhaps an interrogation scene?!).  Unfortunately, Douglas is only decent and Longoria isn't given much to do.  Perhaps, however, there just wasn't enough "meat" in the script to do anything with.<br /><br />Overall, then, "The Sentinel" is a stock political thriller and absolutely nothing more.  If you haven't seen many of these movies, this one will appeal to you.  If you are a veteran of the genre, though, please move along.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I found, The Sentinel not very interesting and kind of boring.  The plot seemed to be attractive but for some reason just could not really get into the film.  Might be good enough to watch once for the serious Douglas fan but if you pass on it don't think your missing much.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The first film that overtly had to do with the remembrances of a secret service agent trying for keeping alive the life of a President was "In the line of fire".<br /><br />Nevertheless, this movie experiences a sensible twist of fate, when precisely there's a love affair between the President's wife and one of the best agents (Michael Douglas), who likes to seduce wives of married men. As a matter of fact he was involved into a painful incident with a colleague ten years ago (Kiefer Sutherland). But soon the things will change for hi, when a sinister plan in order to kill the President begins to appear.<br /><br />The rhythmic vitality of the film, the unbearable dramatic tension, the stunning cast, the formidable direction, the splendid photograph  and the solid edition, make of this thriller a must-see.<br /><br />A winner!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Having just looked up when he was born and when the film was made, I can go ahead with what I was going to lead off with; that Michael Douglas looked his age and that fit the part he played, a very senior secret service agent. Perhaps he looked too old for all that running around but, then, those guys do keep in good shape.<br />Oh, yes, as to the picture. I liked it. It was a good action picture by a competent group of actors and a director who knew that one of the secrets of using a hackneyed plot, as most film plots are, is to keep up a fast pace so that people don't have slow stretches in which they might start thinking of all the holes you are trying to paper over. Douglas handles himself as the old pro he is as do the other younger pros. I suppose, before we learned what  some Presidents have been doing in the White House (and, presumably, at other locations) it might have seemed a bit of a stretch to have the First Lady involved; now, of course, I shouldn't think it raised even a flicker of "oh, that could never happen".<br />So, not much to say that is not reported in the description of the film and the previous reviewers remarks. There is more than enough to grab and hold your attention until the end without any depressing thoughts about reality to jar your involvement.<br />Now its two years later and I have just seen the DVD again. Funny thing: I had already framed the same response I gave originally. I suppose that means something about the film and/or me.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a Secret Service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot.<br /><br />This is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish. Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments. However, it is unfairly bashed here.  My advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment.....which is what movies are all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Michael Douglas plays a long-time Secret Service agent who took a bullet in place of Ronald Reagan during his [...] attempt.  Word has it that there is a plot to kill the current President and Douglas is supposed to be the man working on the inside to see that the [...] is successful.  Investigators don't have to look far to uncover a motive, as Douglas has been carrying on an affair with the First Lady.  Douglas has a tough job in eluding the investigators who are after him and trying to find the real Secret Service mole.  This is a slick, fast-paced movie with plenty of star power in Douglas and Eva Longoria.  It will provide you a good evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>This is a well casted film with a interesting plotline- a presidential security agent is accused of treason and while he is hunted he has to find the real mole.  However the film never really takes off as promised.  So why does it earn three stars?  As I wrote above, the cast is quite good and it is watchable so long that you do not have high expectations. Eva Longoria shines as a beautiful rookie and Kiefer Sutherland plays a role that mirrors his tv character is 24.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>The acting here is ordinary although it was good enough to give a 2 star movie a three.

Michael Douglas (also a producer on the film) & Kiefer Sutherland are great together. This is a great, political, action ride. Clark Johnson's (who also directed "S.W.A.T." (2003) & who also appears in a small, but crucial role to the film) directing is excellent. George Nolfi's (who also wrote the screenplay to "Timeline" (2003) & the story & screenplay to "Ocean's Twelve" (2004), screenplay, based on the novel by Gerald Petievich (who was a Secret Service agent), is excellent. The music by Christophe Beck (who also did the score to "The Pink Panther" (2006) is excellent. The cinematography by Gabriel Beristain (who also did the cinematography to "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) & also did the cinematography to Johnson's "S.W.A.T" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Cindy Mollo is great. The casting by Robin D. Cook (who also did the casting to "16 Blocks" (2006) & "Lucky Number Slevin" (2006) & Avy Kaufman (who also does the casting to the upcoming "All The King's Men" (2006) is great. The production design by Andrew McAlpine is excellent. The art direction by Halina Gebarowicz & Rocco Matteo is excellent. The set decoration by Carolyn 'Cal' Loucks is excellent. The costume design by Ellen Mirojnick (who also did the costume design to "Failure To Launch" (2006) & the upcoming "Deja Vu" (2006) is excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>This a movie that you would love even though you can pretty much guess the outcome.

Then add to the spice he being framed while there's a plot to kill the president. While who called to lead the investigation but Michael Douglas protege played by Keifer Sutherland who is bitter and resentful towards Douglas character. Who part by the way I enjoyed. Then Eva Longoria who is Sutherland partner who more like the eye candy of the movie.

Of their releases there is only one that I cannot stand (`Cars') but there are quite a few I consider absolutely wonderful (`Ratatouille', `The Incredibles') and one that I consider a near masterpiece (`Finding Nemo').  In my personal opinion, `Up' is the best thing they have ever done.  It is, quite frankly, a modern masterpiece in animated filmmaking.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple on the outset.  Carl Fredricksen (who looks an awful lot like Spencer Tracy) is a crotchety old widower who is holding onto the only memory he has of his departed wife; their home and a dream of adventure.  When circumstances shift, paving the way for Carl to be court ordered to a nursing home, he decides to try his hand at adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his roof and going up, up, up and away.  With a young stowaway named Russell, an overweight boy-scout of sorts, Carl sets off in hot pursuit of Paradise Falls, the land he and his beloved wife always dreamed of exploring.<br /><br />Let's get one thing straight; this is a story about a floating house, so don't expect it to be realistic.  To those who pick apart plot holes such as "where was Russell's mother this whole time" and the like, sure it isn't realistic, but are you really expecting it to be?<br /><br />One thing I will agree on is that this is a very sad and dramatic film that may not be suitable for all children.  I do feel that it may be good for children who face similar situations as Russell to see their home life displayed in a sweetly appealing setting like the one presented in this animated film, but I do also feel that some subjects discussed may be too deep or even unsettling at times for young ones.  It was choking me up.  Within the first ten minutes we are introduced to themes such as the inability to have children (or it possibly could have been a miscarriage) and the death of a spouse.  Themes such as single parent families and neglect come into play as well, and the ending, which is sweet, is also laced with sadness.<br /><br />The film will make you smile and laugh, but it will make you cry A LOT.<br /><br />With that solitary caution (it does tend to get very violent towards the end as well, and with attacks made on a child I find that it may be a concern to a parent) I have to say that this is a very, very, very good movie; great even.  No, better than great; it is a MASTERPIECE.  The animation is stellar, the concept is original and engaging, the humor is strong and the gags are all on point, fresh and welcome.  For me, it was nice to see such strong emotional themes explored in this context.  It adds a different layer to the general consensus of dramatic entertainment.  Sure, this is no where near as gritty or as overwhelming as `Grave of the Fireflies', but `Up' allows the humor to play a perfect balance to the mature point of view this film is taking.<br /><br />There are very few animated films that can handle both sides of the spectrum with such grace and eloquence.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Like an another reviewer intimated here, watching animated films the past five years, I have often shook my head and wondered, "How does it get any better than this?"  Then an animated film like this comes out and shows me.<br /><br />Overall movies may not be better today than "in the old days," but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation.  This is another example of that.<br /><br />The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning.  I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes.  From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny (and it's cheaper here at Amazon) to anyone who appreciates art.<br /><br />By the way, this is not "a funny cartoon" but a suspenseful and sentimental adventure story, with a few laughs along the way. I would think adults would like this more than kids.  Meanwhile, everyone - regardless - will have their jaw drop more than once - viewing the incredible-looking scenes. Finally, if you like extras, sit back and enjoy: there are tons of them in this four-disc set.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I'm not an aficionado on animated films and, truth be told, I rarely watch them. With that said, I have not seen every Pixar film, but I can tell you there's never been one I didn't like. Whenever I end up watching one I'm stunned at how many levels it succeeds on as a motion picture and it's probably not a bold statement to imply that Pixar is the most consistently reliable animation studio.<br /><br />The film's opening is an achievement in the animated medium simply for the emotional response it evokes from it's viewers with stark simplicity. Carl Fredericksen and Ellie meet as children, brought together by their mutual yearning for adventure. The story of their entire relationship concluding with her death is told using no words and is handled more poignantly than it would have been in many live-action films. Carl (now voiced by Ed Asner), a balloon salesman, adjusts to life without Ellie wandering his home without purpose and frequently annoyed by the construction occurring right outside. After city officials decide to place Carl in a nursing home, he attaches a great number of balloons to his house and begins steering his floating house to Paradise Falls, a place Ellie and himself had for years dreamed of going. Of course, Russell, a young, na?ve Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his "help a Senior citizen" badge is standing on the porch of the floating house.<br /><br />The story picks up steam upon their landing, where they discover a rare bird (nick-named Kevin by Russell) that begins following them. Problem is there's a group of mysterious dogs with collars allowing them to speak tracking the bird. One of these dogs is Dug, a marvelous creation courtesy of Pixar. Dug, the comic relief of this film is an adorable, funny, sympathetic character in a film that already has more memorable characters than just about any film this year.<br /><br />Up is such an impressive film. It uses none of the animated film-clich&eacute;s; there is no adult innuendo, no clich&eacute;d, mass-produced characters. It's geared towards children, but will appeal to all audiences because it's really a quality film. It has truly human characters that are emotionally complex and funny. The fact that Pixar continues to create characters that are both human and sympathetic is more of an achievement in animation than 3D is.<br /><br />With a beautifully vivid color palette and inspired voice work by Asner, Jordan Nagai (as Russell), Bob Peterson (as Dug), and Christopher Plummer (as the film's antagonist, you'll know about him when you see the film), Up is one of those films that makes it unfortunate the Academy has a Best Animated Film category. It will more than likely win this award come Oscar-time, but Up isn't just one of the best animated films of the year it's one of the best films of the year. It succeeds on so many levels that animated films should not and most live-action films do not. It's a great animated film, yes but also just a great film, period; A stunning achievement on all levels.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>When Carl Fredricksen was young, his hero was Charles Muntz.  Charles was a world renowned explorer.  It was that love that lead him to Ellie, a girl who also idolized Charles.  The two eventually married.<br /><br />The years went by, and the two never did fulfill their life long dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America.  Buy the time our story really begins, Carl (voiced now by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man.  The land around his house has been sold to a developer who seizes on one action by Carl to take away his house, too.<br /><br />The night before Carl has to leave, however, he seizes on an opportunity.  He blows up hundreds of helium balloons and sets out for South America.  He has a stowaway in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Explorer looking to get his badge for helping the elderly.  Together, the two set out on a wild adventure that includes a giant bird and Dug, a talking dog (Bob Peterson).  Will they reach Paradise Falls?<br /><br />I've got to admit that the last couple of Pixar movies haven't been the homeruns I've come to expect from them.  This movie was perfect in every way, however.<br /><br />So let's get the negative out of the way first.  This movie is fairly predictable.  I guessed most of the major plot points for the first two thirds of the film not too far into it.  But, as always, the ride through those elements is absolutely wonderful.  And the movie features the return of Pixar's patented climax that will not quit.<br /><br />The movie expertly balances comedic and tender moments.  This is especially true when Dug shows up.  I can't stop laughing at his antics.  But a musical montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the climax also moved me to tears.  Some have found it too serious, but I think the two are blended perfectly to present us with an uplifting message on the power of people who love us in our lives.<br /><br />Of course, they bring all this together with the perfect visuals.  Once again, there are some truly breathtaking moments.  I don't know how they keep topping themselves in this department, but they do every time.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG for mild peril related to a storm early on and elements of the climax.  I think only the easily frightened will have a problem with it.  Additionally, the movie does touch on death and divorce as it relates to our two main characters.  Frankly, I think both are handled well, but parents might want to be prepared to discuss that with their kids.<br /><br />This truly is an uplifting movie that will make you laugh and send leave you wanting to hug the ones you love.  I may just have a new Pixar favorite.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Someday, Pixar is going to do it -- they're going to create an emotionally uninspiring, lackluster animated movie.<br /><br />But in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful for-all-ages animated movies like "Up," which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety seventysomething old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little message about not letting the present be bogged down by the past.<br /><br />As a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their "clubhouse" together, and lived a long but sadly childless life together -- and when Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.<br /><br />Now crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't about to go quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away in the general direction of South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an "assisting the elderly" badge.<br /><br />But the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug ("I am jumping on you, bird!"), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.<br /><br />Industry experts were babbling about how "Up" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, that shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.<br /><br />In fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.<br /><br />But it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue ("Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything." "Cool! My mom loves that game!") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.<br /><br />Ed Asner is absolutely perfect as the ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his beloved wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing that what he's really clinging to is his past. Jordan Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, sweetly chattery Wilderness Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. He's really just a sweetie-pie.<br /><br />And the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk ("I hid under your porch because I love you") and act ("Scream all you want, small mailman!") the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.<br /><br />"Up" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy. With that, I have only one more thing to say... SQUIRREL!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>The first 10 minutes of this movie and the last 5 minutes of this movie are the most touching, romantic, and tear jerking moments in this film.  There's also some great metaphors sprinkled throughout the movie, too, especially about learning to let go of the past in order to appreciate the present.  I especially liked the scene where all his furniture comes flying out of his house and I took note of how the furniture landed on the ground.<br /><br />It surprised me that a kid's movie would be so meaningful.  I'm sure the meaning will be lost on little kids, but they should still appreciate this movie given the imaginative aspect of it (a flying house, a talking dog) and will probably think the little boy and dog are funny.  And adults will be reaching for the tissue box.  So this is a movie I see both adults and kids liking.<br /><br />The reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars (that was a hard thing to do since I loved this movie so much) was because it was slow moving at parts and the whole villain with attack dogs didn't quite work for me for some reason.  But other than that, a wonderful movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`Up' is another Pixar gem.  Able to transport the minds of young and old and enhance its story with sympathy and charm, the movie is understandably touted as one of the year's best.<br /><br />Since the beginning of their marriage, Carl Frederickson (Edward Asner) and his wife Ellie (Elie Docter) have yearned to move to Paradise Falls in South America.  Smitten by his childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), Carl and Ellie scrimp and save, but contingencies force them to open their savings jar until one day Ellie passes away, and Carl is forced to live alone with his dream broken and nothing but his memories intact.<br /><br />Around his house construction workers are building new city buildings, and a job foreman coaxes Carl to sell his house.  One day Carl confronts a worker who damages his mailbox, and the ordeal sets Carl up to be placed in a nursing home.  Carl then meets a young boy scout who wishes to earn his final merit badge, assisting an elderly person.  The boy gets more than he bargained for as Carl desperately tries to regain his footing and elude those who would change his life forever.<br /><br />Colorful and cute, Carl's journey and the characters he encounters are enough to enthrall, but the story is even more transporting.  The peril is enough to keep even teenagers interested, yet keep their sympathies for the elderly intact.  The way the animated scenes unfold is the most engrossing aspect of yet another successful Pixar project.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Many people disagree with me about this, but I'm sticking to my guns because of the level of enjoyment I received from these films. The disagreement is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWF8">Wall-E</a> was some sort of exceptional film and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007A2GSW">The Incredibles</a> was only so-so. I had the exact opposite experience. I found Wall-E to be so-so and The Incredibles to be a wonderful film because of the human element attached to it. Also, both The Incredibles and this film, UP, had a PG rating and not a G, which might mean that deeper, perhaps disturbing things, made this film carry more emotional weight. And it most certainly does.<br /><br />Edward Asner plays Carl Fredricksen, a man who's loved and lost. Yes, we ACTUALLY get to see an old person pass away at the end of their life ...in an animated feature. Imagine that. Reality. This gives Up more bite and we empathize with Carl on a very basic human level. Whereas with Wall-E, we're trying to gain empathy for a machine that's acting like a human. Not the same thing.<br /><br />Into Carl's lonely life comes wannabe boy scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's trying to earn a merit badge. But Carl wants none of his help, nor does he want to help Russell gain the badge.<br /><br />Amidst Carl's life is his understanding that his now dead wife Ellie never got to have any adventures. She married Carl and bought a home, which took over their lives and made them home-bodies. They both grew up worshipping adventurer Charles Muntz and wanting to go and find out what happened to him. But Ellie never made it. So, when Carl's house is being threatened by developers and his life steered toward Shady Oaks retirement facility, Carl attaches a mass of helium balloons to his house and floats away. Trouble is, that pesky boy scout is on-board, too.<br /><br />Eventually they make their way to South America and discover dangers, foes, friends, and, yes, adventure. Talking dogs with an obsession for squirrels add a high amount of hilarity to several scenes, as does a unique bird that befriends Russell and loves chocolate.<br /><br />More telling is the friendship that blossoms between Russell and Carl as the generation gap closes, and Carl learns to open his heart (and mind) to new experiences. Also learning to let go of Ellie's memory adds an incredibly deep plot-line to an amazing story.<br /><br />The animation, like most 3-D style animations, is impressive. The colors, shadows, and depth made the scenes come alive. But it's the story that makes it all worthwhile. Just like The Incredibles, this is a tale about human beings doing unique things but with regular challenges and mental hurdles. It is this that drives me to see complex animated films, not a robot .</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I enjoyed "Up" quite a bit, despite some slow stretches and a couple of obvious plot holes - if Carl is 78 years old, Muntz would be 100+. Production is superb, and the opening segment, showing us Carl's life with his beloved Ellie, is touching and true-to-life.  Once the main story begins, however, things spin slightly out of control; as with all Pixar movies, there's a lot of action for action's sake, even if it doesn't always make sense. Nonetheless, this is a fun movie, suitable for ages 8 and up. I'd give it 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Up is a great film and defiantly ranks as one of Pixar's best- as well as one of the best animated films of the last ten years.  The only films that can compare are Pixar's Wall-E and The Incredibles.  The film is just a pure delight and one of the most mature films to come from the company that is without a doubt the most consistently entertaining studio in all of Hollywood.  It was easily the most mature, well thought out film I viewed during the 2009 Summer Movie Season, and I'm sure it will be considered one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Story:  The story is one that has the light-hearted fantasy feel of a children's movie, while at the same time retaining the dark elements of an adult tale of obsession and greed.  Its plot is a very complex analysis about the passion of love, loss, and obsession and I was fascinated every-single second.  But, I should warn parents, behind the cute old man and the flying house this is ranks up with The Incredibles as one of the darkest films to receive the PG rating within the states.<br /><br />The story is about an old man who, after the death of his wife, lives a lonely, uneventful wife.  After assaulting a construction worker he is deemed a threat to the community and is told that he shall be removed from his home and forced into a retirement community.  With little choice he chooses to fulfill the dream that him and his spouse shared of placing their home near Paradise Falls in South America.<br /><br />Using thousands of helium filled balloons he begins this expedition, but along the way he is joined by many unexpected companions, ranging from a determined scout, a talking dog, and a large exotic bird.  In the end he is forced to decide what matters most in life.<br /><br />The film is modeled after the serials of the 1930s-1950s and carries along that fun, adventurous spirit throughout.<br /><br />Animation:  It's Pixar, what do you expect?  As usual it is top of the line and obviously had long hours of emotional effort put into it.  The animators for Pixar never seem fed-up with their jobs and always deliver the best.<br /><br />Voices:  Voice-acting is also top of the line.  Every voice actor is clearly treating the role seriously and having a fun time doing it.<br /><br />I highly recommend Up to children and adults- heck, I would recommend the movie to an adult, regardless of whether or not they had children.  It's just that good of a movie that it transcends age groups to be the most widely appealing film of the summer.<br /><br />Up emotionally compelling and full of fun with endless imagination.  It certainly deserves a rental and a space in your home movie collection to enjoy again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this was a really good and very funny film! Carl, Russell, and Dug are the perfect team of comedy! When Carl is a young boy, he meets a new friend named Ellie and find that they both love adventure. They get married and spend their lives together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes depressed and forgets about his old promise to Ellie about visiting Paradise Falls in South America. Carl is soon visited by a little boy named Russell, who is trying to get his "Assisting the Elderly" badge. Carl soon turns his house into an airship using thousands of balloons. He finds out that Russell was still on his house and assists him in his adventures. Carl runs into his boyhood hero, who actually turns out to be his enemy. With the help of Russell and Dug, the lovable talking dog, Carl tries to save a female bird named Kevin by any means necessary. I highly recommend that you go UP!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ATHTCOG6BB6WK.html">ATHTCOG6BB6WK</a><br/><p>What a wonderful story about life. Every curmudgeon was once an adventurous and wide eyed child but as life takes you on its unpredictable path, you can lose sight of that and forget. Up is an adventure story of the best kind. A disillusioned old man realizes that true joy, the stuff of life, isn't about the destination but lies in meaningful companionship while on the journey. The movie has serious undertones but young Russell keeps things lively. His youthful enthusiasm initially annoys the old man who is set on reaching his life long destination spot at Paradise Falls. At the outset of their unplanned adventure together, the old man is grouchy, impatient, and sees the kid as a nuisance. Later, in the true spirit of adventure, the old man discovers that he and Russell have something in common, they need each other.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>To be honest, the first time I saw Up in theatres, I liked it, but I just did not see what everyone was so excited about. I kept thinking to myself, "What's the big deal?" I am very happy to say that I finally see what the big deal is. Up is a beautiful, heartfelt story. It captures the life of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) perfectly from his youth, to his golden years. The montage near the beginning was one of the most wonderful things that I have ever seen, and probably the most wonderful thing that I have seen in a Pixar film to date. The scene itself set a variety of moods, from sad to joyous, but the music really brought it to life. It was perfectly set to another great score by Michael Giacchino, who also blew me away with his Star Trek score. In my opinion, Up has to be the best Pixar film yet. They have done nothing but good things for the last couple of decades. It seems like everything they make becomes a classic. Until I saw Up for the second time, I would never have imagined myself ever saying that it was the best they have done so far. But it is the truth. The imagination is a beautiful thing, and those guys over at the Disney Pixar studios have plenty of it. I loved the maturity in the tone of the story, even though it remained a children's' movie all the way through. I'm sure not too many kids would have picked up on the little hints like, *Possible Spoiler* why they were sad in the pregnancy doctor's office, or why Ellie couldn't make it up that hill, etc. But those are the kinds of things that make both children and adults love these movies so much. There is something in it for every single person in the crowd. Everything in the film is well done, but this story is undoubtedly character driven.<br /><br />The characters were all delightful. Carl reminded me so much of my own grandpa. So sad deep inside from the lost of his wife, and so grumpy because of his sadness, but also so caring for others and eager for adventure. Russell, I'll admit he annoyed me at first, but I soon realized that's what he was supposed to do. We were supposed to feel what Carl felt. Then over time, as we heard Russell's story and saw how nice of a person he was, we grew to care about him like we did for Carl. Doug and Kevin were great from the start. Even though Doug started off trying to capture Kevin for his master, he was always so sweet and funny that we never disliked him for it. Kevin made me laugh out loud a couple of times, especially when he mimicked Carl. Charles Muntz was an unlikely, yet great villain. He was the sole motivation for Ellie and Carl's fixation on South America, but his dedication to his quest drove him crazy. This was just an all around fantastic movie. The only reason I cannot give it a full score is the little things that I didn't like, like the dogs flew the airplanes and tied Russell up. The explanation for them being able to speak was acceptable, and the fact that they could speak added dimension to them as characters, and ultimately the story itself. But then they did those things that pulled me out of the story. Yeah, I do understand that the whole premise of a floating house, and everything is not really based on anything practical, and nor does it try to pretend that it is possible. Of course it's a children's movie, and they are expected to be like that. I just didn't like those aspects of it, but they didn't take anything away from how brilliant the overall film was. It was a masterpiece. I cannot wait for Toy Story 3, and whatever Pixar has slated after that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I had no expectations of being disappointed with a Disney/Pixar BD, and being that it took me a whole dedicated day to get through everything, I now feel it was worth every penny. The film was enjoyable, funny, sad, and scary filled with some nice messages about life and loss. I can understand why the majority of my customers loved it.<br /><br />The Blu clarity is outstanding, and the amount of reference points are extensive, but one that stands out the most for contrast lines would have to be when the house is entering the lair (balloons against the dark cavern). The sound is selectable between 5.1 DTS, 2.0 DTS and Descriptive English. The 5.1 was beautiful with tons of reference points, sometimes excruciating (that bird screeching) but thorough nonetheless. Now for the supplements (all times in minutes):<br /><br />DISC 1: (BD)<br />* 5:46 Partly Cloudy short film. Was hilarious. A great depth test for your display with the clouds. Nice little message of tolerance no matter how difficult someone might be.<br />* 4:40 Dug's Mission. An almost lo-def looking short take on our main dog dealing with the main three baddies on a chase.<br />* 22:17 Adventure Out There. A must see documentary about the crew taking the actual trip to the Tepui location in South America. A beautiful travel infomercial in itself. Loved how their guide only wore sandles for the ascent and hikes.<br />* 4:56 Alternate Scenes Ending of Muntz. Sketches and interviews regarding different endings for that bad guy that they had come up with.<br />* 1:00 How-to on using the Digital Copy.<br />* Cine Explore option while watching the film. The two directors give their commentary with multiple pop-up screens showing art, ideas, etc.<br />* Screen Saver. Allows you to set a time period for your screen saver to activate.<br />* Maximize Your Home Theater. The standard Pixar multi-step process for setting all of your theater capabilities.<br /><br />DISC 2: (BD)<br />Documentaries<br />* 6:24 Geriatric Hero. History behind the creation of our old guy. All of these documentaries are interview oriented with sketches and film clips to supplement.<br />* 8:26 Canine Companions. In depth analysis on the breed choices, training and dog behavior studied to get the dogs in the film to be more - dog like.<br />* 9:00 Russel Wild Explorer. Covers the reasons for his character to have the loss and why he was "egg" shaped as opposed to other sketch ideas.<br />* 5:04 Kevin (bird). Nice reference to the Swiss Family Robinson ostrich; covered the hardest part of any of these animation films - the feathers.<br />* 4:38 Homemakers Pixar. Enjoyed the work that went into them studying sub-floors and lighting options in making this look so real in the house.<br />* 6:25 Balloons and Flight. Tells the now famous number of balloons used; some interesting dirigible history; shows the Pixar group using that local Bay Area air service I keep seeing fly around here (research stuff).<br />* 7:37 Composing for Characters. Have to be into the musical/scoring stuff for this one.<br /><br />Extras<br />* Global Guardian Badge Game. After the initial setup of name, difficulty levels and tutorial material, the game has an extensive amount of country/geography material. Customers grouped around and we did fine for the United States section, but we randomly tried Africa and we bombed (some of the countries they were asking for I hadn't heard of in years) - good learning tool though.<br />* 9:15 Alternate Scene - Married Life. Another sketch/interview piece about more material being removed/added into that section of the film. The scene itself would have been only a minute longer.<br />* 6:00 montage. A mix of characters doing funny things - will make the kids laugh.<br />* Screen Saver option.<br /><br />DISC 3 (DVD)<br />* Film, plus special features from disc 1. WITH THE EXCEPTION of no Spanish subtitles/language; English only.<br /><br />DISC 4 (Digital Copy).<br />* Code both unlocks the copy and gets you the usual points at the Disney site.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent product no matter how you look at it. The case has that new single hinge, multi-page off center chassis that has proven to be less than durable, but it should suffice for low usage storage.

But in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful animated movies like "Up," which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little story about loss and love.<br /><br />As a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their "clubhouse" together, and lived a long, sadly childless life together. When Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.<br /><br />Now crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't going quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away toward South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an "assisting the elderly" badge.<br /><br />And the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug ("I am jumping on you, bird!"), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.<br /><br />Industry experts were babbling about how "Up" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.<br /><br />In fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.<br /><br />But it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue ("Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything." "Cool! My mom loves that game!") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.<br /><br />Ed Asner is absolutely perfect as ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing he's clinging to the past. Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, chattery Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. And the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk ("I hid under your porch because I love you") and act the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.<br /><br />The two-disc edition is going to have some very nice extras, but once again people with regular-def DVDs are going to get shafted because the Blu-ray edition will have a bunch of exclusive stuff. Grr. As for this one, there's a digital copy, the director's audio commentary, kinda-alternate-ending "The Many Endings of Muntz," and the documentary "Adventure Is Out There" about the research for this movie.<br /><br />There are also a pair of adorable animated shorts. "Partly Cloudy" has a much-abused stork having to deliver potentially harmful baby creatures from a kind but clueless cloud. And "Dug's Special Mission" is a sort of backstory for the adorable Dug, explaining what the heck he was doing before he met up with Carl and Russell.<br /><br />"Up" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy. With that, I have only one more thing to say... SQUIRREL!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Disney Pixar's Up is a beautifully animated -though atmospherically quiet and occasionally slow-moving- movie intended mostly for children.  Hey I guess that makes me a big kid for watching it, lol.<br /><br />It's about an old man who takes a special journey to South America to visit a place he and his wife talked about visiting while the wife was alive.  Well after the wife finally dies, the old man decides to take the journey himself by actually lifting his house off the ground by way of thousands of floating balloons.<br /><br />It's funny because throughout the film, a crucial element to the storytelling is the old man constantly dragging his floating house around everywhere he goes, lol.  To join him on the adventure is a young boy scout looking for a badge that's awarded for helping the elderly.<br /><br />Is it just me or does the old man look almost identical to Joe Paterno, Penn State's football coach?  It's almost too hard to believe it's just a coincidence.  Back when I was watching previews of this film from the TV commercials last year, I could have sworn Disney actually designed the old man to look like Joe.  Maybe not...<br /><br />I don't know about anybody else, but the beginning segment involving the old man as a child and introducing himself to the woman who would turn out to be his wife is REALLY emotional and downright devastatingly sad.  I was seriously sitting there crying as the film quickly went through the motions of the man and woman starting out as children, then growing up and getting married, fixing up their house, not being able to have a baby, growing old, and eventually leading to the wife departing.  Maybe it's just me but the amount of sadness in this particular segment is really unbelievable.<br /><br />Upon landing in South America, the old man and the boy scout meet up with some animals and have the adventure of a lifetime.<br /><br />Up is a really good animated film for anyone looking to spend a little entertainment with their family.  I highly recommend it.  Just be warned when watching the first 10 minutes- make sure you have some tissues available, lol.  Really effectively well done bit of storytelling there.  Incredibly touching on so many levels.  The film never goes in *that* direction ever again.  Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>Just when you think Disney-Pixar animation has hit the ceiling, they come up with another engaging film. "Up" ranks as one of the most original tales the team has come up with, featuring one of the most unlikeliest heroes. Carl Fredericksen (perfectly voiced by Ed Asner) was a young boy who idolized Charles Muntz, a revered explorer whose discovery of a rare South American bird fossil turned out to be faked. Forcing him back to the Amazon, Muntz vanishes for years. Carl unexpectedly finds common ground in his dreams of flight & exploration with a sprightly girl named Ellie. In one of the most touching episodic montages I've ever seen, Carl & Ellie live out their lives together: From marriage to daydreaming on a grassy hill to the "Paradise Falls Fund Jar" (which keeps getting raided when emergencies arise) to Ellie's illness & subsequent death. Now alone, old and beside himself, Carl is facing the mothballing of his remaining days in a retirement home. What to do? Simple: The retired balloon salesman attaches thousands of colorful balloons to his quaint little home & sails off to Paradise Falls, the place him & Ellie had long ago dreamed of going to. Unfortunately, Carl has picked up a passenger cowering on his porch: Russell, a pudgy Wilderness Scout who's trying to earn a merit's badge for helping the elderly. Russell is soon driving the old curmudgeon crazy.<br />Upon arrival, Carl soon learns that this expedition is more than he bargained for as Dug--a cute dog fitted with a human-voiced collar--and "Kevin", the rare bird of Muntz's obsession--are along for the ride. Sure enough, Carl encounters the elderly Muntz, whose hero worship of him soon turns deadly once the half-crazed Muntz discovers Carl is harboring Kevin. And so, the movie's tempo shifts from a reflective, whimsical tale into an action-packed adventure full of offbeat twists & turns.<br />In the "adventure book" that Ellie leaves behind, she writes to Carl: "Thanks for the adventure. Now go have a new one!" And that alone sums up what the film is saying: Never stop living, and be there for the younger generation.<br />DVD extras include the charming & amusing original short "Partly Cloudy", and the new short "Dug's Special Mission", an extension of the movie's plot.<br />An animated film that will always remain one of Disney-Pixar's most special efforts!</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>It made me cry, it made me laugh, and I came out of the theater with a smile on my face and oddly the sky and clouds looked just like in the movie. :-D<br />This is a movie for All ages, young and old alike.

Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>Perhaps I should begin this review with some interesting facts about 2009's Up before even beginning to break down the nuts, bolts and personal opinions of the film.  Up represents director Pete Docter's first Pixar project since 2001's Monsters Inc, it was Pixar's first ever 3D film, it was the first Disney collaboration to earn a PG rating since Pixar's The Incredibles, it features Pixar's first Japanese/Asian-American character, it was the first Disney/Pixar film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (only the second animated film ever to do that), and until Toy Story 3, it earned notoriety as the second most commercially successful Pixar work (behind Finding Nemo).  Now that's quite a bit of distinction!<br /><br />So what's with all the hype you ask? I can't be positive but in my opinion it is the least Pixar-like of all of the Pixar films.  How so? Well I typically associate the company with plot concepts so overly clever that they would be charming even if every other aspect of the film bombed (which has, to date, never happened in case you're wondering).<br /><br />Up is, well, different.  It starts out by recapping a very-human couple's lifespan then transforms into a fairly straightforward adventure story.  No monsters here, no robots, living toys, and even the talking animals are explained scientifically!<br /><br />Up is a comedy adventure about a 78-year-old widower and retired balloon salesman named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), who finally fulfills a rather unorthodox lifelong dream of great adventure when he ties thousands of balloons to his house and sails toward the wilds of South America.  It is this flying house gimmick that will forever stick in the collective minds of the public (and inspired the film's title) but beyond the superficial there lies a pretty charming tale of the human condition that harkens back to vintage Disney in their 2D prime.<br /><br />Up opens by telling Carl's story with extraordinary tenderness and a sense of pacing that hints of a brisk, consistent emotionally charged story. However, the balloon driven air-abode represents the introduction to the second half of the film, which essentially transforms our gray-haired heart string tugger into a bit of a geriatric action hero; a sort of Indiana Jones' great grandfather if you will.<br /><br />Fortunately this is Pixar here people, and any doubts of pointless exposition are offset by the unique dynamic established when Carl finds himself an unintentional guardian of a boisterous young scout precisely 70-years his junior.<br /><br />This young Wilderness Explorer (think boy scouts without the legal snares for rights), Russell (Jordan Nagai), provides some wonderfully humorous moments that act as the perfect catalyst to bring out the comedic best from the ever-grumpy Carl.<br /><br />The visuals, which as is par for the course with the companies involved, are appropriately awesome with photo-realistic texturing, mind-boggling lighting effects, and characters positively charged with personality.<br /><br />The score comes from none other than living legend Michael Giacchino (no stranger to Pixar's scoring demands, having worked with them on The Incredibles & Ratatouille).  It is appropriately epic when need be and charmingly intimate when the film's proverbial heart calls for it.<br /><br />In all Up provides a very charming emotionally laced 96-minute joyride that manages to pack a whole lot of charm into what really boils down to a fairly straightforward adventure piece.  Like all of Pixar's works, it succeeds in providing something appealing to viewers from any conceivable age groups and does so with an effortlessness that hints to the reality that Pixar could very well be the best place to work in the whole world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Up begins with Carl Fredricksen as a boy meeting the love of his life, Ellie, and shows them dreaming about traveling to the mysterious Paradise Falls in South America. The movie fast forwards through scenes of their beautiful life together, all the while their dream of traveling eludes them. When Ellie dies, and Carl is about to be ordered by the court into the Shady Oaks retirement home, he escapes by tying thousands of balloons to his house and floating to South America. Now that Ellie is gone, Carl just wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, Russell, a local scout trying to earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, is pulled into the adventure too.<br /><br />They head for Paradise Falls and end up battling the famous explorer Charles Muntz who is trying to capture a rare bird assisted by his band of dogs who can talk with the help of special collars. After a shaky start, Russell and Carl become close friends who look forward to spending time together. Up is a wonderful story about chasing one's dreams, but more importantly, it is about making new dreams and never giving up on life.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>A very outstanding film featuring an unlikely hero who is old and offers us many lessons about love, life, loss and heroes having clay feet. Some of the best movies in the film industry are being made by Pixar. In my opinion the first fifteen minutes of his life were fantastic and actually brought a lump to my throat such was the power of this animated movie. Some of the scenes other than the first fifteen minutes stay with you, such as the house's final resting place after the balloons have snapped- simply superb. Ed Asner who simply is Carl Fredricksen, Jordan Nagai as Russell and Christopher Plummer nailing the role of Charles Muntz.Four stars 6/18/10</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Up / B001KVZ6G6<br /><br />I wasn't sure I'd enjoy "Up" - the previews all seemed like a stereotypically Grumpy Old Man who comes to appreciate the life that he turned his back on through the Power of Friendship, or something equally wholesome and two-dimensional.<br /><br />Of course, this is a good example of how previews just aren't everything. Our grumpy old man has a name, Carl, and it turns out he's not so grumpy after all - but he has suffered a terrible and heart-wrenching loss. Pixar is to be congratulated for managing, again, to really flesh out a character in scenes that involve little-to-no actual dialogue, and in such a surprisingly short time - after the first 15 minutes of the film, I can almost guarantee you will care more about Carl than you have for the protagonists of the last dozen films you've watched. (OK, mileage will vary there, but seriously, Pixar does a wonderfully direct and succinct job of making you care for Carl as a person.)<br /><br />There's so much to like about "Up". There's such a strong theme here of journeying to capture what you "lost", even if what you're trying to capture is something you never actually had. His tag-along friend, Russell, is also searching for something he has lost-yet-never-had, as he hopes that by finishing his merit badges, he might somehow regain the love that he remembers having from his father. If that doesn't break your heart, then nothing will. And the comic relief, Dug the Dog, is actually funny and heart-warming as well.<br /><br />To my surprise, I really, really enjoyed "Up". I'm not quite sure how to rate it, though - I'm very glad that I've seen it, but...I strangely don't feel the need to re-watch it, which is unusual for me. Maybe it's just that "Up" burns itself into your memory so indelibly, or maybe it's just because it's a real tear-jerker, and I hate to cry, but for whatever reason, I'd recommend this as a rental first, and not necessarily a buy. Not because the movie isn't wonderful - it is! - but because "Up" might leave such a strong impression on you that you might not *need* to see it again... at least not without a box of tissues nearby.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>I bought this 4-disc BLU RAY version of "Up" yesterday - Monday 15 Feb 2010 (its UK release date) and watched it last night with the kids.<br /><br />I'll not bore you with its genius, its beautifully scripted storyline, its staggeringly real themes - but I will bore you with the PICTURE QUALITY - because it's simply off-the-charts astonishing.<br /><br />We've got "Monsters Inc.", "Cars" and "Wall-E" on Pixar BLU RAYs - but this takes the gong. To say it's beautiful to look at - is a wild understatement. If ever a film showed how good HI DEF can be, then "Up" is it. The man-hours that must have been put into this - the detail is gob-smacking.<br /><br />The faint stubble increasing on Mr. Fredricksen's chin as the days go by (he wouldn't have shaved), the scuffing on the caps of his shoes, the fingerprint smears on his goggles as he watches the Munz footage as a child in a cinema, the dust particles in the beams of light as the young Carl wanders into an abandoned house on hearing a girl's voice (the love of his life, a young Ellie), the grown-up Ellie, her hair blowing gently in the wind (viewed from the back) as she sits in her chair having been given the awful news about...<br /><br />I don't why it's all so touching, so funny or so charming - it just is.<br /><br />Other brill things include Ed Azner's perfectly cast voice as the grumpy old man Carl, the constantly chattering and whining Russell, the 8-year old Wilderness Explorer boy scout who latches onto to him, his house and his dreams, Dug the soppy talking dog, Kevin the tall South American bird who mimics everything and races across the screen like a demented gangly Road Runner, Christopher Plumber's fantastically sinister voice as the elderly Munz the Explorer - it's all magical stuff. "Up" could even win an Oscar as best film?<br /><br />Disc 1 also contains the wonderful short that preceded the movie "Partly Cloudy", trailers to "Toy Story 3" and "The Princess & The Frog", a making of "Up", alternate Munz endings, while Disc 2 contains loads of exclusive bonus material. Disc 3 is the DVD and Disc 4 is a CD (complete with code) that you load into your Mac or PC to get a digital download copy of the film (portable). It's all fabulous stuff and a genuine joy to look at.<br /><br />Pixar has set ludicrous standards before, but "Up" is just 'so' good - major-league kudos to all involved.<br /><br />Treat yourself to this absolute winner people because you need "Up" on BLU RAY in your home.<br /><br />Breathtaking stuff boys.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>If you've heard the story about the guy who tied helium balloons to his lawn chair and then took to the skies, multiply the balloons by about a zillion, tie them to a two-story house and launch, and you have the seminal idea behind UP.<br /><br />It all begins very much like It's A Wonderful Life. Young Carl Fredricksen and friend Ellie have a shared passion: adventure. Specifically, they both idolize adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who travels the world in his gigantic airship, the Spirit of Adventure. But when Muntz can't prove that a unique skeleton he brought back from South America's Paradise Falls isn't a fake, he is publicly disgraced. Vowing to go back and find the proof to clear his name, he boards his airship in anger and disappears into the clouds.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ellie tells Carl that she wants a house on top of Paradise Falls, and Carl innocently crosses his heart in promise to give it to her. When they grow up, Carl and Ellie marry, and, as in It's A Wonderful Life, they move into the rickety old house they once played in. They fix it up and live there for many happy years until Ellie passes away. Carl ends up as a crotchety old widower with an enormous building project going up all around him - and they want him out. So, remembering his promise to Ellie, and to escape his gloomy fate, he ties a zillion helium balloons to his house and takes off for South America and Paradise Falls.<br /><br />This is an adventure par excellence, very European in feel, with the charm of Ratatouille. But it is an odd assortment of characters. Besides Carl, who looks very much like Spencer Tracy and is played by Ed Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), there's a stowaway: boy Wilderness Explorer, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's working on his Helping Old People merit badge; a canine named Dug (Bob Peterson) that they meet in South America, and who has an electronic collar that allows him to talk; and Kevin... There are a pack of dogs, all with talking collars, but three main ones besides Dug: Alpha (again, Bob Peterson), Beta (Delroy Lindo) and Gamma (Jerome Ranft). Alpha has trouble with his collar, so that it produces a very high-pitched voice, which for an alpha dog is very embarrassing.<br /><br />Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., story for WALL-E et al) and Bob Peterson (screenplay for Finding Nemo, story artist for Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life) co-directed this tale from a script by Peterson. It's a very sweet and funny story, full of poignant reminders that, while we need to seek adventures in life, the most important adventures are the ones we go on in our daily lives: such as marriage and parenting. The importance of fatherhood resonates in the relationship between Carl and Russell. Then there's Kevin...<br /><br />I think the biggest laugh comes when Russell's face is slammed against the window of Muntz's airship, and then is dragged across it making a streaking sound, while Muntz's eyes follow it inside. Of course, Russell is funny in general, being so naive. Then there are the dogs, who refer to Russell as "the small mailman" because of his Explorer uniform. Just about every dogism is used, from their love of balls and hatred of squirrels, to the dreaded "cone of shame." Dug is especially enjoyable because he is the quintessential dog every kid loves.<br /><br />Visually, the film is stylized in a very lovable way, similar to a children's book. My favorite part are the balloons - they're terrific. This type of imagination and adventure builds strong values in kids. Contrast it with the previews that precede the movie of Disney fare that do little more than teach kids to live in out-of-touch dream worlds. It's hard to understand how Pixar and Disney joined forces. Disney doesn't seem to have a clue, and Pixar has every clue. I thank God for Pixar. They are just about the only bastion of good-quality, family-oriented movie-making left. Walen Media, who is so into books,  should borrow a page from Pixar's. May Pixar's tribe increase.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>A touching, very fun and hilarious animated film that is incredibly beautiful and highly detailed.  Disney*Pixar has once again raised the bar for quality CG animation and awesome storytelling.  "Up" is probably the best film thus far to come out in 2009 and a fantastic Blu-ray release from Walt Disney Studios.  There's no doubt about it, this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!<br /><br />From the creators of "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters, Inc." comes "UP" from Disney*Pixar.  With the yearly success of CG animated films by Disney's Pixar Animation Studio, "Up" is not just a film that improves upon modern CG animation, it's a clever film that manages to capture youth but also old age.  Through this film we see pain, loss, laughter, compassion through the wisdom of age but also the naivety and spontaneous side of youth.  An adventure, fantasy film that will capture your attention and make you laugh but also have you in awe of what Pixar Animation Studios was able to accomplish.<br /><br />"Up" is directed by Pete Docter (writer for "Wall-E", "Monsters, Inc.", "Toy Story" films),  a screenplay co-written by Bob Peterson ("Ratatouille", "Finding Nemo") and music by Michael Giacchino ("Lost", "Fringe", "Star Trek","Alias", "Ratatouille", "The Incredibles").  The film has received mostly all positive reviews from film critics and the film was a box office success making over $292 million worldwide.  The film was the second highest grossing film domestically by Pixar (after "Finding Nemo") and the fifth highest grossing animated feature in the US of all time.<br /><br />And now that film makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut on Nov. 3rd.  "Up" on Blu-ray is presented in a four-disc release which includes a Blu-ray Disc, a second Blu-ray Disc with the special features, a DVD copy of the film and a Digital Copy of the film.<br /><br />The film first introduces us to a young Carl Fredricksen who is watching his idol, the famous explorer Charles F. Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer, "The Insider", "Nicholas Nickelby", "A Beautiful Mind") who brings back the skeleton of a 13 ft. bird that he found in South America. Of course, because this bird is a species not known to man, scientist calls the bones as fake and Muntz then decides to leave back to South America and to prove people wrong, he would return with the living bird and won't return until he finds it.<br /><br />For young Carl, Muntz was his hero and he would wear his pilot goggles and carry a balloon that would say "Spirit of Adventure" named after the flying vehicle that Muntz rides.  But Muntz is also the hero of a girl named Ellie.  Both kids love adventure and meet each other in a rundown house which they call their club house.<br /><br />We then see Carl and Ellie as children and later become young adults who marry and renovate the run down club house to be an actual home.  Ellie's dream and her passion for adventure is to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America and Carl makes his promise to her that he will make it happen.<br /><br />As they grow older, each time they save money for their trip to Paradise Falls, they run into financial situations in which they have to dip into their savings.  Since Carl makes a living as a balloon vendor, they enjoy a simple life and live in the same house, still in love with each other.  But as time has passed for both Carl and Ellie, by the time they are ready to go on their trip, the two have become very old and eventually, Ellie passes away.<br /><br />Now older Carl (voice by Edward Asner, "Lou Grant", "Mary Tyler Moore") is alone, an angry recluse and feels that he has nothing to live for with his wife gone.  His home is all he has and it's his constant memory of his love for Ellie.  But his home is now in an area where commercial buildings are being built and the construction company has tried to buy his home but since it's his memory of Ellie, Carl refuses.  Meanwhile, a Wilderness Explorer, a boy named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) needs his final merit badge and to achieve that, he needs to to "assist the elderly".  Russell is a talkative young boy, a bit much for Carl and Carl sends him off to hunt a snipe.<br /><br />One day, a vehicle of the construction company smashes into his mailbox that he and Ellie painted together and Carl is so much in rage that he beats the construction worker in the head and leads him to bleed.  He goes into court and is ordered to move into the Shady Oaks Retirement Home.<br /><br />On the day he is to leave his home and start his new life at the retirement home, Carl unleashes his plan by using all his balloons which takes his home out of the ground and flies off and literally avoiding from him to separate himself from the home that he and Ellie had lived in for decades.  His goal is to make good with that promise he made to Ellie and that is to move their home to Paradise Falls in South America.<br /><br />All seems good for Carl, until he receives a knock on the door and realizes that young Russell was snipe hunting on the porch all this time.  Thus Carl is shocked that his plans may be thwarted because he has a child with him.<br /><br />Carl and Russell end up in South America where they  meet a very tall bird which Russell names it "Kevin" and also meet up with a dog named Dug who is able to talk (due to a neck collar that allows speech) who seems to be hunting for the bird for his master.  The four end up being on an adventure through tough terrain in South America.  Why is Dug after Kevin?  Why is Kevin needing the help of Carl and Russell?  And who is the original master of Dug who built the talking collar?  But most of all, will Carl be able to keep his promise to Ellie by bringing the house to Paradise Falls?<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Up" is an audio and visual treat.  Presented in 1080p (1:78:1), Disney*Pixar raised the bar of their own previous works and managed to capture so much detail in this film, literally I was floored by how incredible this film looks.  From the moment I saw the CG skin of Carl, the detail of the clothing, of leather, the detail inside the home of Carl and Ellie, the detail on the plants, the rocks, the sky, you name it..."Up" is an incredible looking film on High Definition but an animated film in which the famous animation studio has raised the bar yet again.<br /><br />By watching how the creative arts group at Pixar actually went up high into the Tepui mountains, saw all the rock formations for themselves, a chance to embrace, draw and see how things are in the area but also see how Paradise Falls looks in reality, definitely gave the crew a major incentive to make sure the atmosphere of "Up" was just as detailed as they saw with their own eyes.  From the flowers, the plants, the unusual rock formations, the sky and weather conditions, the animation crew was able to capture it so closely with again, so much detail... I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looks.<br /><br />There are also details in the way Russell wears his clothes and the clothing movement, the hair of the dogs and how the lighting effects reflect from the hair off the dogs, the slobber of the dogs.  Just the way the physics are with the balloons as it carries the house and more!  There is just a lot of well-thought out details that come along with the film and you just can't help but be impressed.<br /><br />Picture quality is absolutely fantastic!  Walt Disney Studios have pretty much been leaders in quality for their animated releases on Blu-ray and the colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and dark but again, the sheer amount of detail is just incredible.  No compression, no banding.  If there was a film that I can easily classify as "reference quality", "Up" is definitely a film I would put high up there.<br /><br />As for audio quality, the film is presented in English 5.1 and 2.0 DTS-HD (and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby).  The film also sounds incredible.  From the dogs barking all around you, the sound of the weather around South America, the balloons popping and the action sequences at the end of the film.  Sound is crystal clear from the front and center channels.  The film also sports solid surrounds capturing the overall ambiance and rear surrounds and also good amount of LFE usage especially during the storm sequences and when the house is bumping around the rocks.<br /><br />This is definitely a film that sounds incredible on Blu-ray and the lossless audio is definitely crystal clear and immersive.

The film does a great job of balancing his story, his emotions of trying to keep Ellie's memory alive through his home, while Russell represents that innocent and naive child and seeing these two characters, total opposites together and trying to make things work.<br /><br />But what I found touching is that initial first 10-15 minutes of the film and seeing Carl and Ellie grow and the pain they have encountered in their life.  The inability to have a child, to see their dreams dashed by situations that required the money they saved up for their trip but the pain of seeing how these two have grown from children to seniors.  One thing that the Pixar crew wanted to accomplish with this film is to capture that appreciation you have for your grandparents but also, an animated film that young children can enjoy through the character of Russell.<br /><br />There are some deep things that happen in the film, circumstances that children probably will not understand but for adults, these emotions that touch you profoundly.  Of course, a lot of these deep emotions are for the first 15 minutes of the film between Carl and Ellie as we see flashbacks through their married years but the film becomes highly entertaining once we see the child, Russell and the old man Carl together and having to work together, despite Carl getting a bit annoyed by Russell's youth and non-stop talking and moving.<br /><br />But it's the pacing set by the screenwriters that work.  The film never gets boring as it the film becomes very adventurous and also humorous throughout.  The humor of a house traveling throughout parts of the world on hundreds of balloons is just a fun concept.  And again, the film never gets boring.  It's just an exciting and fun ride when both Carl and Russell are together and manages to end with an uplifting ending.<br /><br />And the fun doesn't stop there.  This Blu-ray release is packed.  Four discs with special features that really go into how this film was created and learning about the things that inspired the filmmakers but also the trip the Pixar crew took to the mountains that inspired them to create that atmosphere.  That was great to see.  But also there are fun shorts for the children as well and also a game.  And of course, a DVD for those long commutes and a digital copy as well.<br /><br />As for the PG rating, this is the second Pixar animated film to get the rating since "The Incredibles" and mainly its because of the action sequences.  Those sequences are not scary at all and I watched the film with my six-year-old.  If anything, he was asking questions which related to Carl and Ellie's marriage (parts which relate to a scene in which Carl and Ellie are unable to have children and the scene where Carl is mourning after Ellie's passing).<br /><br />"Up" is a film that was geared not just for children but for adults.  The film is mature enough for adults to appreciate, enjoy and to be ultimately touched but also lively, fun and exciting for children to enjoy.  Definitely one of the top films of 2009 and one of the top Blu-ray releases of the year thus far.  Overall, "Up" is absolutely magnificent and this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>A few years ago, I watched the film "Gran Torino" and was completely blown away by director Clint Eastwood's take on themes such as aging, friendship, and coming to terms with one's own life.  However, those who are easily offended (by either harsh language or non-political correctness) would likely not be able to get past those hang-ups, while kids are ruled out altogether.  Thankfully, Pixar's "Up" explores those same themes in a much more family-friendly fashion.<br /><br />Basically, the story centers on Carl Fredricksen, a senior citizen widower who's being cajoled out of his old relic of a house by construction ("progress") on all sides of him.  Instead of going out smoothly, though, Carl decides (being a retired balloon salesman) to fly his home (via a gaggle of helium balloons!) to Paradise Falls, the mystical place that him and his deceased wife Ellie always dreamed of, but never quite realized.  However, there is one hitch in the plan...that being the completely helpless boy scout, Russell, who just happened to be on the wrong porch at the wrong time.  As they make their way towards the falls, Carl and Russell encounter a slew of new characters and challenges, making it truly an adventure in every sense of the word.<br /><br />The first level that this film really works at is with the kiddies...the intended viewers.  There are enough sight gags (involving the rotund Russell and crotchety Carl) and crazy characters (the talking dog "Dug"...squirrel!) to keep their interest the whole runtime.<br /><br />However, on a much deeper level, this film will truly move even the most adult of viewers.  An amazing sequence towards the beginning of the film depicts the marriage (both the ups and the downs) of Carl and Ellie, and really sets up Carl's character development as he is forced to venture out into the world again and bond with young Russell.  With each passing moment (and new adventure), viewers get the feeling that Carl is taking another small step closer to making a clean break from the past and living for the here and now.  The scene where he finally realizes that fact is enough to make your eyes begin to water.<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Up" to be the pinnacle (at least so far) of animated films for its ability to make you laugh, tantalizing your senses, and really draw you into the characters and their successes/struggles.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>All this humble reviewer can add here among the reviews is that I really loved this film. My wife and I nearly cried within the first 11 minutes--when the Karl Fredericksen character's life-in-flashback is shown--but then, we are old codgers.<br /><br />The remainder is a delight and quite realistic...for one of those funny cartoons with geometrically challenged characters. Karl looks like Spencer Tracy in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" (everyone I asked about this point agreed with me). Right down to his glasses.<br /><br />One criticism I have--and I took away a star for it--was Chrsitopher Plummer's explorer character. He was far too menacing, and I don't think children could really relate to this type of thing. My wife stated that the character seemed far too much for children to handle.<br /><br />This review has been obtuse for a reason: enjoy this film for yourself, without anything further being mentioned by me on the subject. It will take each viewer to a different place, I suspect, and it has some of the funniest moments on film (which I wish had been more and had extended longer).</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>The Pixar machine has so many feathers in its cap it now looks like a Vegas showgirl. UP is Pixar's tenth animated feature film and I would say that it's among the studio's best, except that each of its pictures tends to rank pretty much right up there. And it's looking more and more like there's no end in sight concerning Pixar's run of awesome. (Rumor has it that John Lasseter, Pixar's head honcho, once broke wind and it smelled like dandelions on a gorgeous summer day.)<br /><br />While on the surface still very much geared towards kids' sensibilities, UP trots out some fairly mature adult themes. If the first twelve minutes of UP don't at least choke you up, then you are a soulless cyborg. The opening act is a nearly dialogue-less montage, and it encapsulates the life of a man. This segment is absolutely key to setting up the rest of the story, makes you root for the old cranky, creaky gent Carl Fredricksen. The stuff that he goes thru, the sadness that crushes him, the dreams and hopes that get dashed because life simply got in the way - you know exactly why he goes on to do what he does. Which is sail away in his house strung up on thousands of balloons.<br /><br />You'd have to be an utter grinch to bring up the slovenly physics involved, so let's not. Hundreds of feet up in the air, Mr. Fredricksen hears a knock on his door. Bemused, he opens it and sees Russell cowering on his porch. Russell is a tubby eight-year-old wilderness scout, and he's enthusiastic and, if I'm brutally honest, borderline annoying. The kid needs to earn his Assisting the Elderly badge and he's set his eyes on Mr. Fredricksen. We learn eventually that Russell's overeagerness may be his way of compensating for tough times at home. UP, at its core, is about these two characters and their emotional journeys and it's also about the process of, while not exactly putting the past to bed, at least moving on. Carl and Russell move on to South America ("It's like America - but South!").<br /><br />UP is an extremely moving, heartbreaking picture, but it's also very funny and features several things which may make you cry out "Adorable!" ad nauseam. The main villain of the piece is deranged and sinister, and his assistants consist of a pack of talking dogs. Which leads me to this: I love Dug! Dug is one of the talking dogs, a rambling, whuffy Labradorish type, and he's exactly what you'd expect a lovable dog to be like. Dug isn't as clever or focused as the other dogs. He just wants to be loved, and Bob Peterson, the co-writer & co-director of the thing, comes up with the perfect voice for him. Also a neat character is Kevin the giant bird, but Kevin doesn't have a fancy collar which allows her dialogue.<br /><br />The animation is flawless. Why even go into it? It's Pixar.<br /><br />The single DVD version also comes with two riotous bonus animated shorts. "Partly Cloudy," which preceded UP in the theaters, pokes holes in the bird and the bees theory. Babies instead come from clouds. "Partly Cloudy" tells the story of one slightly seedy-looking cloud which leans towards making the not-so-cute babies and the poor stork that has to deliver them. "Dug's Special Mission" is narrated thru Dug's perspective as we see the moments leading up to Dug's first meeting with Mr. Fredricksen and Russell.<br /><br />I like the visual twist of a house kept aloft by a gazillion balloons, and then this floating house being toted around by our characters as if it were one big balloon. Rather than chilling in the crib, Mr. Fredricksen and Russell actually spend more time outdoors tethered to the house and towing it with them. "Adventure is out there!" is an often mentioned motto in the movie, and our characters land themselves in a wild, exotic adventure. Fun for the kids, fun for the grown-ups, and bolstered by powerful dramatic undertones. UP is absolutely terrific and everyone should go check i--SQUIRREL!"</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />I'm really not a huge fan of animated movies, so let that speak for how much I enjoyed this wonderfully sweet film about a curmudgeonly old man and a lonely boy who end up going on adventures in the jungles of South America; never cloying or obvious, manipulative or hokey, this very funny and sweet film suffers a tiny bit in its slower and less moving middle passage but is nonetheless easily on my shortlist for the best films of 2009.<br /><br />3.5/4</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Although the kids will like the bright colors and the dog and Kevin, this talks to the adults. A touching humorous treatment of love and growing old. I liked it a lot. A couple of the kids napped toward the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>Probably the best animated film this decade. Up is one of those films that makes you look at yourself, at all the promises you made to yourself that one day, that magical day, when you have enough money, when you win the lottery, when you get a break in your schedule, you're going to take that trip, treat yourself out to that nice dinner you deserve, do that thing you've always planned from the time you were bold enough to dream. Once upon a time you were a cub scout, the world was a magical place awaiting exploration. Then one day you woke up, looked in the mirror, opened your front door, and realized that you were old and all you have left are memories and old pictures of the way you used to look when you were young.<br /><br />This is the perfect family movie. I say this because usually when you hear the words "family film" it's usually a film that is very basic, basic and safe enough to take your kid to see. Rarely do you see a film that is basic enough for a kid to get into yet sophisticated enough for an adult to relate with on a level that a child who hasn't been through life's changes cannot possibly understand. Up is that type of film, about an old man holding on to the past, to an old dream, resisting the changes occurring around him. Ed Asner of Mary Tyler Moore fame plays the gruff irascible Mr. Henrick who, along with a stowaway scout named Russel set out for South America's Paradise Falls by way of a cloud of colorful balloons anchored to an old house full of old dreams.<br /><br />The animation in this movie is very colorful, vibrant, realistic, and reminds me a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films in this respect. In fact, the characterizations in this film, particularly the part played by Asner, the main character, is downright scary at times, seems like a live action movie, not because the animation's all that, but because the emotions and humanity are so damn real and don't seem forced. This, along with another one of my favorites, Wall-E, shows why America stands heads and shoulders above everybody in this medium. Sorry went on so long but there aren't enough superlatives to say how fantastic and beautiful this film is. A true work of art, art that you can feel as well as see.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>I was surprised to find that this film goes beyond animation in its design execution and even its visuals.<br /><br />We see Carl Frederickson (voice of Edward Asner) spending his life planning a great adventure. His boyhood girlfriend Ellie shares his dream, they grow old together, and many local adventures drain the big adventure funds of money and time. Soon Carl finds he is alone in an alien world and makes an effort to fulfill his and his late wife's dream.<br /><br />The story gets a little more complicated as he finds an unexpected stowaway and new friends. Soon he is forced to realize what is important in life and finds that he has already fulfilled, Ellie's new adventures by living  a lifetime together.<br /><br />There is so much depth of thought and dimension of story that you could forget it is animated.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version and there are more than enough extras and adjustments you can make. Luckily, you can ignore all this extra stuff and just play the movie if you like<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00273D47O">99 Luftballons</a></p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>Now while "UP" did not make my #1 Pixar movie of all time (which is "Ratatouille", by the way) it certainly is one literally uplifting little delight with sparkling animation, lovable characters, and rip-roaring adventure.<br /><br />Carl Frederickson is a retired balloon salesman and widower.  With the threat of urban sprawl and a court-ordered move to a retirement villa, Carl takes ties balloons to his house and takes off for a long-awaited trip to Paradise Falls.  But unbeknownst to him he has also accidentally carried off local scout Russell.  Despite efforts to return the annoying kid to the ground, the two quickly arrive at the intended destination. Convenient? I prefer to consider it plot device, and it certainly opens for the adventure that is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful, and this is one of those movies that simply look better in sparkling Blu-Ray.  It's a funny, heartfelt, and moving story.<br /><br />And yes, it is worth is to buy the Blu-Ray. I'm not always the biggest fan of all those silly extras, but the documentaries and other production thoughts are nearly as entertaining as the feature presentation.<br /><br />Definitely a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Up was the story of two kids that happened to fall in love with one another, and their love contniued through childhood and into adulthood and beyond. During those years was a lot of happiness and a single want for both of the people involved: they wanted to go on a trip and follow their childhood idol to a waterfall that was placed in a really remote locale. The only problem with this plan was that life kept getting in the way and, ultimately, an old man's love fell ill and vanished from his life. This left him with nothing save memories and a house that the two had built, and even that was being threatened by building springing up all around their home. Then something happened to make the house a monolith that was to be torn down so, in his desperation, the old man turned to the one thing he knew. Balloons. Rigging the house with them, he took the home and saw it go airborne, finally allowing him and his memories the chance that they always wanted. The only problem with that was the stowaway that the old man wasn't expecting and the things he found when he got closer to his dream.<br /><br />Up was not what I expected was was good nonetheless. It was sad, however, and the beginning of the movie touched me and made me wish that the old man would have gotten to do the things he wanted to do when he had his love by his side. you could tell he wanted that as well, and that the house wa smore than a house to him - it was a reflection of the life he had spent with the only person that understood him. As his balloon quest took him on his way, he was forced to choose between this and something he knew was right - and that said a lot on the way things normally play out. On one hand there is the "right" thing to do. On the other is the "things one wants to do."<br /><br />I liked the tale because it took all sorts of things and showed them for what they were. Talking dogs, a person who was not what he was supposed to be, the love of a mother for its children, the hopes of a son as he wants nothing more than recognition from his Dad - all of these things play out and more in such a well-crafted tale. I also liked the fact that the ending was one I did not expect, just as the movie was one I was not expecting. That made me happy and, truthfully, the whole saga touched me and made me feel good about this pick-up.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I would call this a kid's tale, and I say that because of the way it began. It was sad - depressingly so - and I didn't think all of that was what all parents want for their kids. It does have a lot of morality issues it places in front of its viewers, however, and those were interesting to see as they played out before this audience of one. Personally, i liked the story quite a bit and would say that i would be worth watching for children and parents alike. I'm not accustomed to saying that these day, either, but I thought this happened to be true here and recommend this for consumption on all age ranges - provided that parents agree with what is shown in the beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>5.0 stars<br /><br />An exemplary film and easily one of the finest animated movies of them all, Up is up there with Fantasia and Snow White and you name it. Surprisingly sad at various points, this is an amazingly emotional film, which somehow feels funny, in a good way.<br /><br />After seeing this in 3D in a theatre, I think the blu-ray is better. The 3D still felt like an effect; the blu-ray through hdmi on a decent flat screen is astonishing. The colors on Kevin the "snipe" were easily the deepest vermillion, most translucent purple, and so on, that I have yet to see on our LCD screen. Incredible, and a pleasure just on its own.<br /><br />Add a perfect script, flawless animation with especially natural lighting effects, and an overall patina of unstinting quality, and Pixar has made an animated feature that will wear as well as any film of any sort. The retro feel is integral to its charm, and the whole story feels timeless. I really can't think of anything I don't like about Up. Even the sad bits feel authentic, not Disney fake.<br /><br />The various extras are excellent, especially the short that preceeded Up in theatres, and the fascinating documentary about Tepui, the original Paradise Falls area in Venezuela. The folks who made this film seem very sweet and very smart, and that sums up Up.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one highly enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>What can I say except that this film is exceptional not only in its fine graphics, but in it's original story line.  At first, I must admit, it choked me up a bit.  Yes, I was moved by a cartoon!  I admit defeat and am not ashamed to.<br /><br />The way time progression was handled was brilliant.  To be able to view Carl and his deceased wife as children made us feel even more connected to these characters than we would have if they had left that whole time sequence out of the film.  She was spunky, he was quiet.  They made a sweet couple.  She had dreams that they never fulfilled, or so Carl thought.  What he found out in the end was an invaluable lesson...the joys of an ordinary life were treasured by his wife as an adventure in itself and made me realize that although most of our life is made up of the ordinary things like washing dishes, painting the porch and sorting socks...well, it's all an adventure nonetheless.  Take a chance on this film.  It was well worth the time spent watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie was a very unexpected one, but it was also very great. I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already said, but I must put in one caveat - this movie is not for very young children. There is death in here (not just Ellie's own) and young kids might ask their parents if old people really are kicked out of their houses - Mommy and Daddy should expect to answer this question, as it is a sticky one for a kids' movie. For older kids and adults though it is an awesome movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>Pixar Animation Studios is well known for their great movies with original plots and endearing characters.

Some of them like Wall-E which have dynamic animation, and others like Toy Story have a great story but might not be as visually appealing. Up manages to bring together both of these into a wonderful experience for the whole family, as well as for animation fans.<br /><br />The movie starts out with the young Carl Fredrickson who is a fan of the famous explorer, Charles Muntz, and through this befriends a hick girl named Ellie. They later on marry, and keep planning for their own expedition, but as the years go by the burdens of "real life" makes their dream go unfulfilled, and Ellie eventually dies of old age. Carl is now an old man living in his and Ellie's old dream home, which is in danger of being bought out by a large construction company. So, being a longtime balloon salesman, Carl sticks hundreds of balloons to his house and flies it to South America in the hope of leaving it on the cliff at a place called Paradise Falls. The only hiccup in this is the chubby boy scout Russell was stranded on Carl's porch when it took off, and is now along for the ride. Once in South America, they land the house on the opposite end of the plataeau that the falls are located, so Carl and Russell have to carry the house still floating by balloons to the other end like a giant parade float. They encounter an exotic flightless bird, that Russell calls Kevin, which is being chased by dogs with special collars that allow them to talk. One of the dogs is Dug who quickly befriends them. The other dogs force them to where their owner is, who turns out to be Carl's childhood hero, Muntz. He's been there this whole time ruthlessly looking for a rare bird, which is what Kevin is. Carl and Russell barely escape with Kevin's help, but Kevin gets caught by Muntz's mutts. After finally getting the house to the falls, Russell leaves Carl to go rescue Kevin. Carl eventually decides to go to by flying his house after Muntz in his giant zepplin, and despite being in probably in his 80s, Carl manages to free Kevin and Russell with Dug's help. They then hijack the zepplin and head to the States.<br /><br />Up was a pure delight. It took a brave move in making a senior citizen the main hero in a family adventure animated film. The first few minutes are very endearing, and really pulls you into this journey of Carl, and ultimately what he decides to do with himself now that he's nearing the end of his life. I totally think that this is the best animated movie of the year, and a modern-day classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>UP seems poised to win an Oscar or Best Animated film and I can see why.  Who'd have thought a film with a 78 year old hero would be such a hit?  But UP is unique in every way from its poignant opening wonderfully displaying Carl and Ellie's courtship, marriage and her death to the fantastic adventures on Paradise Falls.  And it does so without resorting to the expected cutesiness found in most animated films.  The voice characterizations especially Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer are perfect.  UP is that rare animated movie that appeals to all ages and I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>What an original film for the whole family.  It looks fabulous and it is filmed with creative wonder.  Definitely something "new".</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>There is probably no name I trust more today in film and television than Pixar (with the exception of Mutant Enemy).  Both the quality of their productions and the excellence of their scripts stand out among animated films.  I particularly loved this one because it shatters all previous templates for what a film is supposed to be about.  The main protagonist is a 78-year-old man who bears a resemblance to to Spencer Tracy and his main traveling companion is a young, rotund Asian boy scout.  Along the way they acquire a delightfully absurd and gigantic bird and a talking dog (while I saw this film I was reading Clifford D. Simak's CITY, which features several talking dogs, so for a while talking dogs were a motif in my cultural life).  All of this while attempting to relocate a house carried by thousands of helium-filled balloons to a mythical spot in South America called Paradise Falls.  And the entire affair was prefaced by a story within the story, of the story of Carl and Ellie's long life together.<br /><br />I've yet to see a Pixar movie that wasn't a complete delight.  And as for the appropriateness for small children, I would not hesitate to show it to one.  I think a child will find it entertaining, moving, and inspiring.  The messages in the film are good, positive ones and I not only think that children can see this film without harm, but should be encouraged to do so.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>A joyous movie that has a tenderly unexpected start.  The movie moves in its own direction with confidence and persuasiveness.  The story floats along (yes, a pun)with in your face humor and a quirky melancholy, lighting coated.  The movie perfectly balances modern computer graphics with sentimental decour/themes from the 1950s and prior.  Screentime nicely balanced between the two main protangonists, their animal co-padres, and the icon turned villain. Disney did a fine job undermarketing the movie and letting the mystery of the unconventional story unravel itself secretly before contented audience.  One of the year's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>A wonderful movie for all the family.  The story has something for everyone, comedy, adventure, deep emotional sense, and beautiful Pixar animation.<br /><br />Ed Asner is the perfect voice for the 78 year old balloon Salesman, Carl Fredricksen. Carl is the main character.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is fresh and moving as the the young Carl's life is told through what seems like an album of photos with the final pictures of his wife passing away.  But now we see him as an old curmudgeon thinking he will hold on to the home he and Ellie shared.  Progress is outside his door; buildings are built around him and his home is condemned.<br /><br />At this point, a young boy, Russell, (cute, tubby, Wilderness Explorer) comes into Carl's life.  He knocks at Carl's door and Russell opens many doors for Carl with his optimism and bold ideas.  Russell needs to get a task of helping the elderly done for an award.  The story becomes fun and crazy as Carl, Russell and the house take off with thousands of helium balloons carrying the load.<br /><br />The winds blow the balloon hefted home to South America where many adventures and challenges face the strange pair.  You can't help but laugh at the crazy characters and cheer when Carl at age 78, finally lives his dream.  Russell is a hoot throughout - all I can say it is a fantastic fun ride as well as deeply moving.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>The irrascible Ed Asner is here to provide a narrative as outrageous as it is substantive. Kids, dogs and mean people abide, and all works out via seemingly insurmountable odds. I haven't read any other reviews, but so much is given that all can learn from. Great lessons for kids: old people are not all bad; some kids who don't fit in might have talents that will surprise you; all Labradors will love you, regardless. All of the above depends on how you're treated by those who care for you. A lovely film, lots of action, and lots of love. I enjoyed it very much.  Some DVD extras are good. "Dug's Special Mission" is just an outtake from the film, but an added animated short called "Partly Cloudy" was sweet, sentimental and enjoyable. An extension of the lesson of "Up"... with understanding, all things can be worked out.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>An excellent movie about life and fulfilling dreams.

There are both overt and subtle funny bits galore!<br /><br />Pixar lives up to its amazingly high standards of quality of animation AND storytelling in this far-fetched, yet overwhelmingly fun film.<br /><br />If you are like me you don't often laugh out loud while you watch movies, but I did frequently during this show.  The devotion of the now cranky old man to his wife's memory and a promise he made her drives the storyline, while the "small mailman" (boy scoutish) child provides a solid helping of comic relief.<br /><br />You will come to love lines like: "SQUIRREL!", "I just met you and I love you!", "Oh, it's before!", and many more.<br /><br />If you are a fan of other Pixar films you will certainly enjoy this one too.  I'd say that it's as good as any of the other Pixar movies that have been released.  I think that the thing that makes them great is that the folks at Pixar are able to take the humor in everyday life and place it in incredibly unlikely situations.  Pixars stories also grasp our imaginations today the same way that movie serials and Buck Rogers did for members of previous generations.<br /><br />Thanks for another top-notch film.  May you continue doing so for decades to come!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>I'm not a die hard fan of animated movies and I usually like them vs. loving them. But I'd heard great things and had lots of folks recommend it as an awesome movie so I went ahead and rented it.<br /><br />My overall thoughts:<br /><br />I like the idea of an animated film about an adult. The story of the man who went on an adventure in his lawn chair has always intrigued me and I loved his simple philosophical reason for his trip, "You can't just sit there." (paraphrased). So this story idea appeals to me. Very much.<br /><br />I loved Russell, the little kid who pesters Mr. Fredericksen and Dug, a speaking dog they find on their adventures. Mr. Fredericksen is extremely spot-on. I've encountered this guy before. Russell and Mr. Fredericksen have a Mr. Wilson and Dennis the Menace type of relationship which wasn't my favorite but as the adventure progressed, so did the relationship, and it ended up being a very, very sweet thing.<br /><br />This film is darker than I thought it might be and I don't see it appealing to any kids I know. For starters the opening takes a long time to get to the current story and I was bored with it. Secondly, it's creepy when they encounter the many scary dog minions and the evil master. Kevin the bird annoyed me and though I understand there had to be something thrown in to make the movie more edge of the seat, it just didn't work for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>This computer-animated feature won all sorts of awards when it was released back in 2009. In the film, Carl Fredricksen (voiced perfectly by Ed Asner) is heartbroken over the loss of his wife, Ellie. The last holdout in a city block destined for high-rise office buildings, Carl is ousted from his home. Rather than turn over the house where he and his late wife enjoyed many years together, Carl ties thousands of helium balloons to the structure and lifts off for a grand adventure.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Carl, however, over-eager scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) is trapped on the porch of the floating building. Begrudgingly, Carl teams up with Russell for a hair-raising, heart-warming caper through South America.<br /><br />I loved this movie. LOVED. I laughed. I cried. I was completely charmed.<br /><br />I'm not sure that very young children would understand many parts of the movie. Integral to Carl's character is the loss of his wife, which may make for some difficult explanations. However, the movie offers touching comment on love, loss and the true spirit of adventure.<br /><br />This movie is sooooo worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>This 2009 flick is Pixar's most imaginitive film to date.<br /> In the 1930s, a wide-eyed lad with glasses, flight goggles, and a helmet over them named Carl Fredericksen(Jeremy Leary)sits before a movie screen in a cinema full of equally awed viewers, watching a newsreel featuring his personal hero, aviator and explorer, Charles Muntz( Christopher Plummer)have his career chronicled in an episode ending with his discreditation over a discovery he claimed to have made.Muntz vows never to return from the jungles of South America until he can prove his discovery valid.<br /> Upon leaving the theatre, Carl's young life skips merrily along, until, to his great surprise, he meets the wild, red-haired Ellie(Elie Docter), with whom the staid and quiet young boy shares a passion for flight, and develops a desire to travel to Pardise Falls in South America, since Charles Muntz is her personal hero, as well.<br /> Eventually, they grow up, and marry to the delight of Ellie's boisterous backwoods family, and Carl's elegantly staid family.<br /> They go directly to their dream house, the old boarded-up cottage where they used to pretend they were exploring in a dirigible.<br /> Over the years, Carl is employed as a balloon vendor at a local zoo, where Ellie works as a guide.In their spare time, they picnic on a hill and describe what they see in the clouds.<br /> After learning that Ellie cannot have children, Carl brings her out of her depression by reminder her of her dream to visit South America, and they begin saving for it. Their dream is waylaid by unforseen expenses, and Life's calamities.Life continues, and they grow old together. Sadly Ellie passes away  before their dream can be fullfilled.<br /> Carl retired to the house he and Ellie shared. But things will not be quiet for very long.<br />  The city literally begins to spring up around the Frederickson's cottage. Danny Mann's construction worker, Steve, working on behalf of his foreman, Tom(John Ratzenberger), unsuccessfully tries for the umpteenth time to buy the property.<br />  At the same time, a Junior Wilderness explorer named Russell( Jordan Nagai), arrives at Carl's door, hoping to acquire his "Assisting the Elderly" badge.Carl declines the offer, and diverts the boy.<br /> Legal trouble results in Carl's being committed to an assisted living home. Two male nurses(Donald Fullilove, and Jess Harrell) arrive to escort him to his new home.<br /> But guided by Ellie's spirit, he trumps them all by releasing a mountain of balloons tied to the roof of his house, which pull the house away from its moorings, to the astonishment of the nurses, of a little girl playing in her bedroom in her apartment  highrise, whose world is momentarily but gloriously bathed in an array of colors by the balloon's reflections, and by sundry townspeople.<br /> "We're on our way, Ellie!" Carl solemnly declares as he steers the flying wooden vessel, making his late wife's childhood imaginings a reality.<br /> He is given an unexpected companion  for the journey. Young Russell was caught on the porch when the voyage began, and while Carl is initially reluctant to let him in, the chatty lad is soon given a chance to earn his badge for assisting the elderly in a way he never expected.<br /> They reach South America with a thunderous jolt, and manage to tie themselves to the floating house as they explore the jungle.<br /> They encounter a rainbow colored flightless bird, whom Russell entices with chocolate and names "Kevin", and a mysterious dog with a talking collar named Dug (Bob Peterson). Once again, curmudgeonly Carl accepts the company of both, only reluctantly.But the companionship of both will be invaluable.<br /> The old man and the boy form a bond during their adventure. The widowered septegenarian learns why the young scout is in need of a father figure who will stand beside him when he receives his final badge.<br /> As they doggedly approach Paradise Falls, the spot where Ellie had dreamt of having a house, since childhood, they find themselves diverted by a pack of canines, who, like Dug, have collars enabling them to talk. The most notable of these are the Doberman, Alpha( also voiced by Bob Peterson), and Beta (Delroy Lindo), a bulldog, and another dog named Gamma(Jerome Ranft).<br /> The dogs'owner, as it turns out, is Charles Muntz, and Carl is delighted to meet his boyhood hero.But Carl and Russell realize Muntz's sinister designs on Kevin and must fight to save the bird.Despite Carl's initial refusal to get involved when Kevin is seized, Russell's derring-do forces him to act, ultimately giving the phrase, "Spirit of Adventure" a whole new meaning.<br /> In the end, we see how a lonely widower's life is renewed after loss, and how sorrow gives way to new adventures, new hope, and new joys, if we allow it.<br /> I would give this delightful fantasy the Ellie Badge.<br /> In the final analysis, "Up" is simply "Up-lifting"!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>Another fine achievement for Pixar.  Up has wonderous animation (it is Pixar after all), a great storyline, good performances, and some truly magical, mystical moments are scattered throughout this film.  The scene where Ed Asner's house takes off is really beguiling and heartwarming to watch, and the "story" of Ed Asner and his wife's marriage is beautifully done without being mawkish or overly sentimental.  The film loses its way a bit in the 2nd half.  The dialogue isn't the greatest, especially among the talking dogs.  Ed meets his childhood hero in Paradise Falls and it deteriorates way too quickly, as if the childhood hero (played by Christopher Plummer) has to be a bad guy.  The film generally lives up to its hype, especially in the first half, where the term "movie magic" really means something when you see it full force on the screen.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>Glad that it won the Oscar for best animated movie.  A real lesson on life is contained in this adult movie that kids will enjoy as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Though it was a long time coming, in the case of "Up" it's almost a shame that the Academy created a separate category for feature length animated films.  In a word, it was one of the best films of 2009, period.  Aside from terrific visuals and a great story this film makes cogent observations about aging and loneliness as well as the value of friendship.  My parents, in their seventies now, loaned this movie to me.  They bought it after taking the grandkids to see it.  I conclude this review by saying, "Thanks, Mom and Dad!".</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>I've watched this movie twice in the theater, and now once at home.  It hits a home run for me every time!<br /><br />Those first 5 minutes are so funny and touching.  As kids, Carl and Ellie share a passion for their explorer hero, Charles Muntz, and his voyages to the mysterious Paradise Falls in South America.  They marry, with a newlywed goal of actually going there, but life's challenges prevent it from happening.  They have their careers, he as a balloon vendor, and she as an animal trainer, at the local zoo.  Clearly, they love kids, they love people, and they love each other.<br /><br />And then Ellie dies, their fantasy unfulfilled.<br /><br />It's easy to call old, lonely Carl Frederickson a "curmudgeon,"  and I had this sense from the previews.  However, a curmudgeon is "an ill-tempered person full of resentment and stubborn notions."  Okay...maybe he WAS a curmudgeon for a short period!  But most of his life he was not, and he certainly is not a curmudgeon by the end of the story.<br /><br />Carl finds that he is going to be shipped off to Shady Oaks, a relaxing place for seniors to be seen and not heard.  But Carl, with a lifetime of experience handling helium balloons and that fantasy about Paradise Falls, makes other plans.  And the elderly-assisting, snipe-hunting  Russell, a dedicated and enthusiastic (but terribly urban) Wilderness Explorer Scout, finds himself, accidentally, on the same journey.<br /><br />And this is all in the first 10 minutes!<br /><br />Ed Asner is the voice of Carl, and  Jordan Nagai is Russell.  These are well-matched voices with the characters, and the evolution of Carl and Russell throughout this story is touching, comical, and uplifting.  Dug, the speaking dog (it will make sense in the story), is a perfect sidekick - SQUIRREL!<br /><br />So who will like this movie?  If you are not really a fan of animated movies, the unique story may still be worth the investment of time.  It's a movie for all ages, and all cultures.  In fact, you probably have to be dead NOT to enjoy it!<br /><br />Don't let go of your dreams.  Love as if every day is your last.  Look for adventure.  Keep those promises.  And...<br /><br />SQUIRREL!</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>Pixar can always be counted on to release a cute movie.  This was definitely cute although a little out there in the storyline.<br /><br />After his adventurous wife of many years dies, Mr.Fredericksen turns somewhat recluse.  It had always been their dream to go to Paradise Falls and live there and when he's about to be shipped off to a retirement home, Mr. Frederickson gets an idea.  When they come to collect him the next day, he and his house take off while tied to hundreds of balloons.  The only problem is the local Wilderness Explorer Scout Russell was on his porch and is carried along with him.  They manage to land, but not quite near Paradise Falls and with the house still floating they decide to drag it around to the falls.  But some strange characters show up, a wild colorful bird, and a talking dog, and things start to get a little more interesting.  Namely when the talking dog turns out to belong to a old hero of Mr. Frederickson's and is desperate to get ahold of the strange bird and take it away from its babies.<br /><br />For characters all the voice actors did a great job.  I really liked Mr. Frederickson, he was a great character and while surly, still lovable.  Russell on the other hand drove me nuts, its a bit harsh but I kept hoping Darwinism would kick in for him as he just kept doing such stupid things for a kid his age.  I loved the bird and the dog, the dog especially since it could talk really sounded and acted like what I thought a dog would.  The other talking dogs were great as well. *Spoilers ahead*  Another problem character I had was the crazy explorer after the bird, he was really evil for being in a child's movie and trying to kill a child in it.<br /><br />For a plot it was pretty simplistic but charming all the same.  Sure there's a lot of unbelievable aspects but it is a kid's movie and fantasy elements can be accepted.  I have to say that my favorite part of the movie was probably in the beginning where it showed snapshots and Mr. Frederickson and his wife's life together.  Since it was pixar you know the graphics were good, and they really did a wonderful job on the animations.  It was very colorful.<br /><br />Not a bad Pixar movie, there are others out there I like better, but this one was rather sweet.  Definitely a good kid's movie.<br /><br />Review by M.

When I say this about Disney and Pixar's Up, I mean it both for how the film makes us feel as well as the way it looks. It's filled with glorious animation and spectacular colors. This is the kind of film that will inspire you to buy a Blu-Ray player, if you haven't done so already. Vibrant does it minimal justice.<br /><br />Much like Wall.e, Up is something kids will have a blast with, but will also force them to think. It's not a mindless bouncing off the walls disaster, like so may cartoons have been in the past.<br /><br />Like most great films, Up centers around a love story. Two kids meet and fall in love at a young age, due mainly to their shared common interest in being explorers. They are Carl and Ellie and we see their relationship grow and prosper and eventually turn into a wholesome marriage. This is all shown to us in what I considered to be the film's most original and touching moment. It's all done without dialogue, and is accompanied by a heartfelt score.<br /><br />Sadly, Ellie passes away and leaves Carl alone and heartbroken. They had plans together to travel to one of their favorite places: Paradise Falls. They had a jar with their life savings set aside and everything. But as is too often the case, life got in the way of their plans and with unforeseen bills and expenses, the trip was never had. In case it's not blatantly obvious, you're crying your eyes out by this point in the film.<br /><br />We see that Carl has turned into the sweetest old man imaginable, complete with a full head of white hair and a set of large, dark, square-framed eye glasses. He lost a piece of himself when Ellie died and his beloved home becomes a valuable keepsake for him to remember her by.<br /><br />When he is threatened with losing his sacred home to a rich tyrant, Carl must act fast. Having several hundreds of balloons stored in his home (which is meaningful to the story) he remedies a brilliant plan. He will take his house, with the help of those balloons and a whole lot of helium, and will fly away to Paradise Falls!<br /><br />His plan works, but he soon realizes he has unintentionally brought someone along with him; a small boy-scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai).<br /><br />The two befriend one another and embark on an incredible adventure, involving a classic villain voiced by Christopher Plummer, and several other interesting creatures. Marking it as only the second animated film to ever be nominated for an Oscar for best picture of the year; Up is sure to become a timeless classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 5.0<br /><br />Continuing to build on their hefty r&eacute;sum&eacute; of animated excellence, Pixar presents us with their next masterpiece in Up, a film that manages to further teach, amaze, and entertain audiences everywhere with its touching story, adventurous characters, and always-appreciated detail to attention and nuances. When I first saw this in theaters, I was bewildered in a lot of ways. This was the first Pixar movie I'd seen in theaters in a looong time, it was also my first 3D viewing, and it also reminded me of why I haven't tried watching said movies in a while (&lt;-- noisy kids distracting me). But in buying the Blu-ray and having a chance to watch all the extras in the comfort of my own home, I dare say the movie left such a long-lasting, subconscious resonance, that I just about instantly remembered and picked up on so many of the wonderful themes addressed in the film's spectacular screenplay: age, dreams, preoccupation with life, feeling a sense of fulfillment, loneliness and separation, the hardships of death and the eventual resolve of letting the past go, companionship, and last but not least, the spirit of adventure(!). The movie itself succeeds on many levels, and a lot of that has to do with fine, fine voice acting from Ed Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and the various sound effects cues of Kevin via Tom Myers, the sound designer. The script thoroughly and deservedly reflects that innocence I mentioned and evokes something of an almost goofy, yet chummy quality throughout the film. Right from the get go of Muntz's opening film reel to the very end when Carl awards Russell the Ellie Badge are we captivated in such amorous ambiance. Literally, the movie is a wondrous adventure within itself. Up is a masterpiece. But in saying what I've already said, it's really just a matter of seeing and believing it for yourself. Certainly, everybody's interpretation or opinion on the film will vary, but here's hoping this writer's take will help some of you to see the great qualities that make this film so very, very enjoyable. Up is definitely one for the ages.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Presented by Disney/Buena Vista in glorious 1080p using AVC and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, it shouldn't be any surprise that Pixar-to-BD equals a perfect score. They're world-renowned for their art and animation as it is, so a direct digital transfer should be a no-brainer. The plethora of color schemes is fantastic. Vibrancy amongst the different locales, isolated locations, and various environments/characters are perfect. Edges are as straight and smooth as a computer can make them. Contrast and black levels have zero discrepancy, and there's not a single sign of aliasing, saturation, banding, EE, DNR, artifacts, noise, or bad editing. The transfer is flawless and worthy of CG demonstration to your guests.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />As with most Pixar/Disney movies, a lot of the sound relies on dialogue and music, with environmental and incidental sound effects on the side. With that said, Up's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track is as crisp and clean as the video. Dialogue is crystal clear with directionality and effortless noise distribution across the front stage. Separation between voices and the uplifting score by Michael Giacchino is also spot on. Surrounds are subtle at first until Carl actually gets his house up and flying into the air. The creaking of the house and inflation of the balloons are great and all, but I'd say the funner parts are during their trip into the storm and dog fight sequence towards the end. LFEs are especially prominent when that thunderstorm starts thundering. It's so scary and ominous, yet so cool and sexy for audiophiles. This is yet another outstanding audio effort from Pixar Studios to demo your systems with.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />Yes, as spectacular as the movie and A/V specs are, the Extras, while cool in their all-HD-ness, only get a 4 from me. The Cine-Explore takes commentary beyond commentary with it's innovative P-i-P approach using storyboards, CG composites, etc. to give audiences a more in-depth look at the film's construction. It's really cool, and I really appreciate Pete Docter and Bob Peterson's insight. I also really enjoy the Pixar shorts and idea of an interactive game. But only 48 minutes of production documentaries? I expected a little more than that. What about interviews with Asner and Nagai or Tim Myers and the rest of the sound crew? The documentaries, while extremely intriguing and informational, feel a bit too short, in my opinion, and very truncated in terms of the scope they could've achieved. Ah, well. Kudos to the production and art staff for their efforts anyway.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />Movie, Video, and Audio are on a level of excellence I think we've all come to expect from Pixar and Disney/Buena Vista these days. While the Extras leave just tad more to be desired, I can't see any reason in the Milky Way why I wouldn't recommend this intriguing work of art known as Up. It's a heartwarming, uplifting, and fun-for-the-whole-audience-adventure movie that will have you crying, laughing, and cheering all sorts of things.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Few Movie companies have as good a track record as Pixar. With better story lines than most Hollywood dramas, Pixar never fails to impress and most of the time astound! 'Up' is a beautiful looking film with a very emotional theme and is probably a little too adult for the younger kids. Pixar leaves out the wisecracking side characters and adds depth to the story of an old man who loses his life partner and must find a way to keep on going. He decides to complete one of the many adventures he and his wife had planned for so many years, but like many of us never seemed to get to it. Yes!, it does sound a little too deep for an animated film, but animated films have come along way and if this is the direction they're headed that's fine by me!<br /><br />The film has some of the most impressive animation ever done and the characters are, well.....almost real! Pixar hasn't really had a bad film and this is certainly among one of their best, but with winners such as Wall-E, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, I'm not sure if this slightly downer is going to become a film to watch over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film and deserves a heap of credit trying to follow Wall-E, but with such an emotionally adult theme, I'm not sure who this film is targeted for?<br /><br />The 4 disc Blu Ray is loaded with interesting extras and the usual standard DVD, digital copy blah, blah, blah, and is certainly one of the best Blu Ray releases I've seen so far. 'Up' is not always as "up" as it should be, but it is one of the most beautiful and poignant films I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Up" is an oddly incongruous film from Pixar in that it has primarily adult themes but a relatively simple visual style and an over-the-top adventure plot. Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) is an elderly widower who had always dreamed with his wife Ellie of far-flung adventures. In particular, they wanted to visit "Paradise Falls" in South America, where their childhood hero, an adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), made his name. Before he is forced into a retirement home, Carl takes one last shot at his dream. He attaches about 20,000 helium balloons to his house, hoists some sails, and sets the house aloft. But Carl has an unintended guest: an boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai), overeager to get his Wilderness Explorer "Helping the Elderly Badge", is on the porch.<br /><br />Carl and Russell have only a few days to deposit the house atop Paradise Falls before the balloons deflate. The boy's idealism and enthusiasm clash with Carl's sense of urgency. Russell befriends a giant bird and a talking dog named Dug (Bob Petersen) but cannot understand Carl's increasing desperation. Carl is an old man who feels the pressure of very limited time to fulfill his life's dream, and at first he doesn't' have much patience with Russell's cheerful but easily distracted temperament. Now, this is entertaining to watch, but how much would a child understand or care about Carl's problem? "Up" does not limit its appeal to children, as "Finding Nemo" and "Cars" did, but I wonder if it has not done the opposite and taken on themes that are irrelevant to children.<br /><br />I hope this will not spoil the movie for anyone, but I feel compelled to mention the strangest thing about this film: There is a man living in the jungle who is right out of Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". He is worshiped and served by a group of violent primitives (in this case domesticated dogs), and he collects the heads (in this case helmets) of those who have dared trespass his little fiefdom, whom we assume he has killed. He's an intelligent, accomplished man whose mind has gone `round the bend. He's Kurtz. Should I be surprised to see a Kurtz character in a "family film"? There is nothing graphic about "Up", and I don't think this guy is any scarier than a typical Pixar villain. "Up" is an entertaining film, though it lacks the visual interest and innovation that I've come to expect from Pixar (it was intended to be shown in 3D). I just wonder what children will make of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>I saw this film in its first week of release in the theaters and with a sizable audience.  The laughs were plentiful ("Squirrel!") and the entire experience very enjoyable.<br /><br />Problem is, can that experience be duplicated watching it at home on DVD or Blu-Ray?  Mostly, but not entirely.<br /><br />The laughs are still there but not as hearty as you get in a theater full of people watching it for the first time.<br /><br />Visually, "Up" is stunning - as one expects from Pixar.<br /><br />The 4-disc Blu-Ray combo pack provides so much value-added material that it would be a bargain at twice the price.  Even if you don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, buy the Blu-Ray combo pack version because you get the regular DVD anyway and you will have all that bonus material IN CASE you ever buy a BR player.  Duh.<br /><br />I don't consider this to be Pixar's best movie.  I liked "Wall*E" and "The Incredibles" just a bit more.  But "Up" easily ranks as one of the best movies of 2009 and does the Pixar legacy proud.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>With all the wonderful films that Pixar has produced over the years, it takes a special film to stand out among the others. Up is that film. I wasn't sure what to make of the preview, which featured this grumpy old man sitting on a porch of a floating house held aloft by thousands of baloons. The film is so much more than that. It's rediscovering the adventure of life when you think there's nothing left. The opening montage, which shows how two people meet, marry, and grow old together, is perfect. You understand how this old man is the way he is. The adventure begins when his home is threatened by urban development, and his ingenious and original way of dealing with it. Ed Asner is the absolute perfect choice for Mr. Frederickson, and all the voice actors are spot-on with their roles. The speaking dogs are wonderful, and how they speak is a refreshing take on how to portray talking animals. The visuals are stunning, which is what we've come to expect from Pixar, but these are exceptional. The attention to detail is down-to-the-minute-detail. I saw this film in 3D at the theater, which was an experience, and I maust say there really isn't anything lost in viewing it in regular play. The sound is just right, without over-whelming the voice tracks, which happens a LOT in movies anymore. You know what I mean; you're listening hard to catch the dialogue then get blow out the back wall by an explosion or gunfire. I didn't get that in this film. All in all, this film is one of Pixar's finest, and that says everything.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Up is by far my favorite Pixar movie. WHen I saw it in digital 3D, I was excited but also very doubtful, because I was unsure of whether or not Disney would be able to reach the heights that they did with "WALL-E". But I walked out of the theater totally amazed! It is indeed Pixar's best film yet, even better than WALL-E.<br /><br />Yesteday I bought this at HMV. When I got home, I watched the movie and then explored the features.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY: 5/5: This edition has what most blu-rays lack nowadays- reak ooomph. You can feel it when the house ascends from the ground! The score is vivified here too, almost in a way that the score plays a real charater in the film. The subwoofer and back speakers create a sense of surrounding too- something that makes you feel like you're in it.<br /><br />PICTURE: Infinite/5- This may just have the best picture quality for the Blu-Ray format. WALL-E and Bolt were both deemed to be the best Blu-Ray releases, but this one beats them put of the park. No grain, no artifacts, no edge enhancement, just perfect. No complaints about the picture at all! The Boosted-Up colors in "WALL-E" looked great, but this movie takes on a more natural look, whereas they still srike you. The montage looked great, but what looked the best were the scenes in Muntz's blimp.<br /><br />EXTRAS: 4/5- They were pretty good extras, but this didn't need to have two discs- a lot of the features could easily fit on one disc. That said, they're still cool. The alternate endings one was really cool, the game was a fun play, and the documentaries were worth watching for sure.<br /><br />TOTAL: 5/5- Do get this Blu-Ray. You will not regret it!</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>What a great animated film from the folks at Disney/Pixar.

They deliver a wonderful movie in every way for audiences of all ages! I had the pleasure of taking my oldest daughter to see this (her first time seeing a movie in the theater), and seeing her facial expressions was priceless. This adorable story is one of the funniest Pixar films I've seen, about an old man who just lost his adventurous wife (in what, I may add, is one of the saddest Pixar montage scenes ever made). In order to fulfill his promise to her, and avoid submission to an "old folks home," Carl Fredricksen uses about a thousand or so balloons and takes off for South America where he will retire to live out the rest of his days at Paradise Falls -- the place his wife so desperately wanted to go before her death. Along the way, though, he is joined by Cub Scout Russell, the very depiction of youth that Carl both envies and at times despises. Along the way they befriend a rare bird, come across "talking" dogs and run into their nemesis --  Carl's childhood hero, Charles Muntz -- who's been trying to kidnap the bird and hence thwart their mission.<br /><br />As usual, Pixar throws in so many slight "Easter Eggs" story lines that it would take more than just one viewing to pick up on all of them. One example of an "Easter egg" storyline plot is the fact that when Carl and Russell first meet, Russell, reading from his Cub Scout guide, asks Carl if he can help him cross the street, cross his lawn, cross anything -- anything so he can get his final badge of helping an senior citizen. Of course, most viewers will/should pick up that Russell helps Carl do another sort of "crossing" by near movie's end. It's a theme that's central to Carl's character and storyline: crossing his heart. Keeping that promise that's so important to those closest to us in life. And what results is one of the sweetest, most touching endings to a Pixar movie. Of course, this comes from a guy who teared up when first watching the ending of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKDR">Monsters, Inc. (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, when Sully pops that final splinter into the door, steps through and hears Boo's voice, "Kitty!" Oh. &lt;sniff> Oh, man. &lt;sniff, sniff><br /><br />Now that I'm a father, those emotions and little cute moments in most of Pixar's movies appeals to me, and touches me, much more than it did before parenthood (although it was still good back then too). "Up" is one of my favorite movies of the year so far; I'll continue to entrust Pixar with the quality they produce.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Up (Single-Disc Edition) is a Disney animated movie from 2009 and is about an elderly man named Carl Fredricksen who one day decides to have an adventure with unforeseen consequences. The animation is great and the storyline is well-developed. The music is amazing and won a well deserved Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Not Disneys best, however a movie that should entertain the entire family. Recommended. 4/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Up" tells the story of Carl, an elderly man who recently lost his beloved wife, Ellie, and is determined to abide by a promise he made her long ago to take their house to the top of South America's beautiful Paradise Falls. A retired balloon seller, Carl devises a plan to lift his home off its foundation and fly to the Falls using thousands of helium balloons. Once his journey begins, Carl is shocked to discover that he has a stowaway on board: Russell, a neighborhood Wilderness Explorer Scout who's desperate to earn his Elderly Assistance Badge by helping Carl. Over the course of their adventure, Carl and Russell encounter a gang of talking dogs, a giant exotic bird, and a dangerous explorer who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Carl ultimately discovers that he still has a whole lot of living to do.<br /><br />I love that Pixar is brave enough to roll with such ingenious ideas that go completely against the norm when it comes to making children's films. "Up" is a great story that will touch the hearts of kids and adults alike. In fact, the first 10 minutes of the movie are so incredibly touching and heartbreaking that they left me, a 30-year-old woman, literally in tears. I don't think any other animated film has ever affected me so much. "Up" is fantastic. See it ASAP.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>What an inspiring and yet, another genuinely enjoyable feature film from the artists at Disney & Pixar studios. I went into this having high hopes as I'm a massive fan of all Disney/Pixar collaborations with the exception of Wall-E which I simply did not enjoy for reasons I honestly cannot explain. I have to say my expectations were not only met, but surpassed. This not only warmed the heart but tickled me to the point I was in genuine tears of laughter. These types of films have developed a way of telling a story through the art of pictures; there is no need for words but music and moving images can tell just as much of a story than an entire script could. Even though I didn't enjoy Wall-E, this is something that I will praise it for. The makers have developed a way of telling a story without needing to explain it to you through dialogue. Well paced and well depicted animation is all you need to really tell a story and this is why I appreciated this that little bit more.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Carl Fredricksen an elderly man who, as a child, idolised explorer, Charles Muntz. Charles Muntz, while Carl was a young boy was discredited as a fraud by claiming to have discovered the bones of a giant bird which he found at Paradise Falls in South America. Determined to prove himself, Charles vows to not return until he has brought back a living specimen of the bird. Meanwhile, Carl meets Ellie, a feisty young girl with the same explorative dreams as Carl and they become fast friends. Then begins the silent homage to their life as it shows them becoming married and living their lives together still as in love as the day they first fell for one another. Sadly, Ellie, in her old age passes away and Carl is left alone in the home they bought and decorated together and around the home skyscrapers are being built with Carl being constantly pressured to sell his home to the company building the skyscrapers. After a series of more annoying events, Carl decides he's had enough and wants to go on that adventure to Paradise Falls him and Ellie always wanted to go on. But instead of just jumping on a plane, he fills his house with balloons and decides to fly there and take his house with him.<br /><br />After the initial launch of the house, there is a lot more to the story as we are gradually introduced to Russell, a wilderness explorer aiming to achieve his "help the elderly" badge so he can become a senior Wilderness Explorer and in order to do this he is determined to help Carl with anything he needs help with. Then, when they make it to the wilderness we meet Kevin the giant bird and a talking dog named Dug. These are characters, although extremely different from one another, blend well together and actually make for a heart warming good guy ensemble cast. Some of the contents of the film are actually quite clich&eacute;. The grumpy old man who's grumpy because he never accomplished his dream and the young boy who has all the ambition in the world and just wants to impress his family. These are character traits indicative of the Disney genre, although that is no bad thing. The setting, although at times filled with vibrant colours, is actually quite bland and unimaginative, though that doesn't take anything away from the animation which, as you'd expect from a Pixar movie, is superb.<br /><br />The comedy, again as you would expect, is very witty and at times unusual but always funny. The bizarre traits of the animal characters dragged along for the ride are both genuine and hysterical, such as the typical dog traits for Dug, but fitted with a human voice amplifies those traits to a comically terrific level. The voice acting of all involved is, again spot on. Although not voiced by major names, the voices fit the characters well; from the loveable old man Carl voiced by Edward Asner, to the adorable Russell voiced by the young talent new on the scene, Jordan Nagai. One of the voices, I wish to point out for personal reasons really took me by surprise as I only realised who this man really was through simply browsing Wikipedia, and I was overjoyed to discover who this man was. Christopher Plummer was the voice of Carl's hero, Charles Muntz. Now the name may not ring any bells with most modern film fans, but to those fans of the old movies, especially fans of musical, The Sound of Music you will recognise this man as Captain Von Trapp himself. That's a little nerdy joy for me, so I hope you'll forgive me for getting a little carried away.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing bad I can say about this film. It's got originality to it that you see all the time with the Pixar outings, yet it keeps to the same old formula Disney has made famous since its creation, yet the mixing styles never get boring. Sure, to some the formulaic layout of the Disney movies may get a tad tedious, and they have even grated on me from time to time, but I adore the Disney/Pixar collaborations simply because they're fun and remind me of the simpler time when I was a kid. This is another strong outing from the team and I would strongly recommend it to all film fans of all ages, as there's something there for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>The best picture of 2009 wasn't a movie about giant blue aliens with a plot stolen from DANCES WITH WOLVES.  Nor was the best picture of 2009 a low-budget film about a military bomb squad in Iraq.  Both of these movies are good movies. However, neither can compare to the elegance, beauty, and simplicity of UP.<br /><br />Though there are other characters in the movie, UP is the story of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner).  The first fifteen minutes of the film touchingly tells the story of Carl's life.  He grew up wanting to experience adventure, married the girl of his dreams, and together they lived a very happy-though sometimes bittersweet-life. By the time the opening sequence has concluded, we already have an appreciation for Carl and a longing to have known even more about his deceased wife, Ellie.<br /><br />Carl is old, but he's also determined.  Skyscrapers and strip malls surround the old house that he and Ellie so painstakingly restored and though the land developer has offered to pay Mr. Fredricksen handsomely for his home and property, he refuses to sell.  However, in the end, through a careless act on Carl's part and a huge wrangling of the judicial system by the developer, Carl is forced to sell his property and ordered to move.  But, good old Carl is stubborn and sets about turning his entire home into a giant airship through the use of thousands of helium-filled balloons.  When the men from the retirement home come to take him away, Carl leaves them behind as he flies up, up, and away.<br /><br />Carl thinks he's alone as he begins his journey to see Paradise Falls in South America, the dream destination he and Ellie always wanted to go.  However, there's a stowaway aboard on the front porch, a Wilderness Scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) that Carl thought he had gotten rid of by sending on a snipe hunt.  Carl reluctantly agrees to take Russell with him, but on the condition that Russell will go home once they reach Paradise Falls.  But the journey to paradise is filled with all kinds of strange and even dangerous adventures: terrifying heights, thick vegetation, talking dogs, rare endangered birds, and an ancient explorer bent on capturing his prey no matter what the cost.<br /><br />Unlike 2008's WALL-E, UP doesn't have an agenda.  Instead, it's a story about one man's redemption.  Carl is a good man who lived a good life, but the death of his beloved Ellie not only turned him crotchety, but caused him to lose his way.  It takes the unbridled honesty and passion of a child to get Carl back on track and face what he could become, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer).<br />Of course, if that's not enough for you, UP also features all kinds of comedy for all ages.  Kids will love Dug and the rest of the talking dogs.  Adults will appreciate the zingy one-liners Carl delivers.  There are also all kinds of allusions throughout the movie (e.g. the dogs in the airplanes repeat lines taken directly from STAR WARS).<br /><br />UP has great characters, moving story, and witty dialog.  Simply stated, it's the best movie of 2009.<br /><br />The regular DVD includes the shorts "Partly Cloudy" and "Dug's Special Mission". "Partly Cloudy" features a stork sent to deliver dangerous baby critters.  The stork longs to have a regular delivery like the other storks, but in the end realizes just how important his job is.  As a side note, in watching UP you can catch a glimpse of a few of the clouds from "Partly Cloudy".  "Dug's Special Mission" illustrates what happens to Dug immediately preceding his discovering of Carl and Russell in the Jungle.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>This film is another success for Disney/Pixar.<br /><br />Thankfully, they are different than the rest.

With each work they release, our expectations naturally get higher and higher. Perhaps this is why I was not impressed with Pixar's "Up" very much. The film flies, but doesn't soar.<br /><br />The best part of "Up" is its opening 10 minutes, where a young boy named Carl Fredricksen meets a tomboyish girl Ellie. They marry, and spend the life together (not without sad moments, however), both dreaming of someday travelling to Paradise Falls in South America. This excellent introductory section almost looks like a stand-alone short film with a very emotional conclusion.<br /><br />The rest of the film is about the 78-year-old Carl and his adventures, accompanied by a very talkative little boy named Russell. Carl sets out for South America in his house floating in the sky using thousands of balloons. Their journey is full of actions, jokes and lessens to be learned - you get chases, visual gags, and even "dog fights" (literally) - and they are always entertaining, if not as touching as the film's initial part.<br /><br />With superb visuals, "Up" remains entertaining throughout, but its story lacks something that draws the viewers into the fantasy world it depicts. This is not to say the film is bad, but with a better storyline and more interesting characters, "Up" would have been a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>It's not a good thing when the cast outside of the leads outshine and overtake the main event. The two leads are like listening to chalk on a blackboard for two obnoxious hours. The old codger is the cranky fuddy duddy you would shy from checking the mail if he was in the front yard next to yours. I don't want to hear it. The wilderness explorer kid is a slap in the face contrivance to the boy scouts of America that they are a herd of cutsie wootsie beings trying to be a flame of gosh golly gee goodness. Wrong. Boy scouts are a serious bunch of explorers that surround themselves in fun with what they are doing. Learning to be a better American, and not a bothersome kid. The dogs should have taken over production as the short animation extra, Special Mission, proves they were more adorable, original, and could hold their own turf away from the dreary humans. Even the extra Partly Cloudy was a milestone in comparison to the main feature. I mean what is with these features. The artists conjure up some finally drawn character, give them some rather cliche typecast traits and expect the audience to fall in love. Like when the old man tearfully browsed through an old photo album with emotional piano score, I was thinking, the audience never got to know his sweetheart other than the goofy intro to the movie. I fastforwrded that part on the DVD, thank goodness, it was giving me the creeps.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Walt Disney has done better animated films in the past. This one is rather average. But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its - her actually - chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course. But I can't resist asking one final question: is the Shady Oaks retirement home covering some shady business or some shaky eugenic mentality concerning the elderly?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film lacked the usual magic that I expect from Disney at its best.

Pixar's "Up" (2009) is such a masterwork - a gloriously imaginative adventure for viewers old and young. Colorful yet unpretentious, this animated feature puts Hollywood's brain-dead commercialism to shame. Senior traveler Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) remains an unforgettable creation. The finest Pixar production to date and a textbook example of great filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>"Up" is an outstanding motion picture; and it earned the honor of being the first animated 3D film to open the Cannes Film Festival. No wonder, too--the story is endearing with lots of action depicting the classic struggle of good versus evil; the animation is the best I've ever seen and the voiceovers leave nothing to be desired. The plot moves along very nicely with good character development and the action works very well alongside the tender message of the film that left me with a tear in my eye. Indeed, "Up" will remain one of the finest animated films of all time because it deals with so many universal issues and themes we think about in life--friendship, loyalty, love, the struggle of good versus evil and the desire to make your biggest dreams come true.<br /><br />The film starts with us meeting two young kids, Carl and Ellie who worship their childhood idol, South American explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Carl and Ellie play together as kids and they grow up to be sweethearts and marry, too.  They are happy together; but their childhood dream of going to Paradise Falls where Charles Muntz discovered bones from an exotic bird never gets accomplished. Muntz has long since returned to Paradise Falls after he was labeled a fraud back home; he told reporters when he left again for South America's Paradise Falls that he will bring back the actual bird dead or alive to prove his discovery was real but he never returned.<br /><br />With time, Ellie and Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) become elderly and Ellie passes away. Carl's house is forever being threatened by new construction; and the court orders him to live at Shady Oaks nursing home after Carl accidentally hits construction worker Steve (voiced by Danny Mann) with his mailbox! Carl also meets a young wilderness explorer, Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). Carl devises a successful plan to have his house float away to Paradise Falls using helium balloons; but after taking off, Carl soon discovers that Russell is along for the ride!<br /><br />Of course, there's much, much more to the plot with action and heartrending scenes that really are memorable. I don't want to spoil it for you by giving too much away. Suffice it to say that Carl does get to South America with Russell where they meet Kevin, a rare bird that loves chocolate and Dug (voiced by Bob Peterson), an incredibly sweet golden retriever. Unfortunately, however, there are some other animals that are not exactly friendly; and this causes huge problems after their other encounter with the now elderly and rather evil Charles Muntz.<br /><br />This two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. We get an animated short entitled "Partly Cloudy;" "Adventure Is Out There;" "Dug's Special Mission;" an optional running commentary with co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson--and more! The second DVD lets you access the digital copy and the digital copy code is provided with the artwork inside the DVD case.<br /><br />"Up" just couldn't be better; the film leaves nothing to be desired. This two DVD set may not be in Blu-ray; but the quality of the picture is very, very good; I am invariably impressed by the fine animation from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures but this time they really outdid themselves! I cannot recommend this film highly enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>I have to admit there are two reasons I took an immediate personal liking to Pixar's 2009 sure-fire contribution to the box office, the Emeryville studio's impressive computer-generated artistry reflecting the most dependable cash cow in the industry. The first is the unique casting of an Asian lead character, a cherubic, hyper-curious nine-year-old Japanese-American Wilderness Explorer stowaway named Russell. The second is the reference to Fenton's Creamery, which is a two-minute walk from my former home in Oakland. Beyond those two points is a surprisingly mature, sometimes melancholy comedy adventure that focuses on a 78-year-old protagonist whose self-proclaimed destiny is to visit a mythical place that he and his wife have dreamed about ever since they first met. Before the kids start moaning, you should also be aware that there are more than enough exotic animals, talking dogs, acts of aerial derring-do, and miscellaneous Indiana Jones-type thrills to counterbalance the film's more sentimental moments.<br /><br />Co-directed and scripted by Bob Peterson and Pete Docter, the movie opens during the Great Depression when a young, shy boy named Carl Fredricksen meets tomboyish Ellie in an abandoned house that she has turned into a clubhouse. They discover they are both aspiring adventurers who dream of meeting intrepid explorer Charles F. Muntz and going to Paradise Falls in South America. An impressively executed montage follows as we watch Carl and Ellie grow up, get married, and grow old together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes a solitary curmudgeon unwilling to sell his home, which is the same house where he met Ellie, amid the high-rises being built all around him. An unexpected altercation occurs after a construction worker accidentally knocks over Carl's mailbox. Forced to move into a retirement home, he hatches a plan to tie thousands of helium-filled balloons (a dazzling effect) to his house and float away to Paradise Falls. What he doesn't count on is the appearance of Russell on his porch early in the flight, and together, they face a series of adventures involving a large flightless bird in iridescent colors searching for her chicks, a lovable golden retriever named Dug who expresses his thoughts by way of a voice-activating collar, and Muntz himself, who has become a Captain Nemo-like figure deep in the jungle with his massive zeppelin.<br /><br />There is a refreshing emotional economy to the story. That's why the 96-minute film doesn't feel as ambitious as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBJEEG">Ratatouille</a> or last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E</a>, but at the same time, there is a deeper emotional resonance in the dilemmas presented since they feel so human-sized. Even as the film becomes more formulaic in the second half, it maintains the limited perspective of its main character as the rudder. I feel that's the key difference between this and other more populated Pixar confections. The vocal work is terrific, especially since Ed Asner (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIYVYK">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a>) perfectly captures Carl's gruff exterior without resorting to cheap sentiment to reveal his vulnerability. Nine-year-old Jordan Nagai provides the right energetic bounce for Russell, while Christopher Plummer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04OM">The Sound of Music</a>) has a field day playing all the various shades of Muntz. Peterson himself does stellar vocal work as both Dug and the squeaky-voiced Alpha, the German shepherd leader of the dog pack. Younger children may be bored by the film's more deliberate pacing and even at the idea of cheering a septuagenarian, but the more patient ones will be well rewarded.<br /><br />The 2009 DVD is chock full of extras beginning with the obligatory short that that preceded screenings of the movie, "Partly Cloudy", a charming concoction in which clouds fancifully give birth to animals. Another five-minute short focuses on Dug's misadventures. Several pieces deal with individual components of the film, for instance, each character's development from inception to onscreen character, how Carl and Ellie's house evolved, and how all the balloons and Muntz's zeppelin came to being. There are alternate endings dealing with what to do with Muntz at the end, as well as one that expands on Carl and Ellie's backstory. Also included are an interesting making-of featurette, a documentary of the filmmakers' visit to the Tepuis Mountains in South America to research the film's overall design and storyline, a piece about composer Michael Giacchino's score, and the various trailers for the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>I have never reviewed a Pixar film on Amazon just yet, but their 10th feature `Up' had to be. Pixar, since Toy Story has spit out one hit after another bringing a whole new generation of legendary Disney Characters. While every single one of them has been incredible `Up' just stands out because it is unlike any of its Pixar predecessors.<br /><br />This is the second film from Pixar to be given a PG rating since The Incredibles. While The Incredibles was more based around comic books and superhero action the first few minutes of Up are very adult oriented. There are extremely real elements that lead us to the main characters adventure, but the previous one he had was real life. It is a beautiful sequence with no dialogue, but a score to show a husband and wife sharing the happy times and the devastating ones, one of them being the loss of a loved one. Even with no words it is so heartfelt and full of emotion it is just something that a young audience might not understand and the scene where Carl assaults a construction worker is also a moment that is very hard to explain to a very young person. After that the story changes gears to a rip roaring hysterical adventure. The cast works so well together especially bringing two legends in Edward Asner and Christopher Plumber. Everyone will love Russell, the eager young explorer who seeks adventure, but there is also more depth to this character that again reflects real live issues such as parent separation. Of course there is pure Disney magic in this film especially in the animals. This time when there are talking dogs, `Up' uses technology to make them speak instead of a traditional imaginative talking animal. That was a stroke of genius making is actually believable that someone can create a device to make an animal speak and still keep its own natural characteristics.<br /><br />Up may be the best Pixar film to date although I love each and every one of them, this just stands out as a story that was trying to get as real as it could. I do feel that if someone tied that many balloons to a house it could fly. So find a way to see this film it will truly lift your spirits and melt your heart. Oh, if you start yelling `Squirrel' at the top of your lungs no one will think you're out of your mind.</p></br></body></html>

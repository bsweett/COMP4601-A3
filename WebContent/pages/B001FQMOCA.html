Johnny grew up poor on a cotton farm, listening to June Carter and her family sing on the radio.  He married a girl from home, worked as a door-to-door salesman, and started singing, but his wife was jealous of Johnny's career and his time away from home.  He met June and was smitten, but they were both married; they continued to tour together for years, through June's second marriage and Johnny's terrible drug abuse.  June helped him kick his habit and later, Johnny proposed to her onstage.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the songs in the movie a lot; I was especially impressed that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing and playing and made it look so easy.  Phoenix's Johnny is a tortured and self-destructive soul, and Witherspoon's June is spunky, kind, and mature. This is surely the best movie for both of them to date.  They have great romantic chemistry on-screen and their close-ups are intense! The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Robert Patrick as Johnny's mean and unrepentant father.  I heartily recommend "Walk the Line;" it is an emotional roller-coaster of highs and lows, with a lot of entertaining music and two very likeable stars.<br /><br />Kona</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>Some people compared this offering as the country version of "Ray".  In actuality, this movie is both the life story of Johnny Cash and the love story between him and June Carter.  The movie is solid with impeccable performances particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  In "behind the scene" feature, the Director himself commented that both performers exceeded his expectations and they managed to get their mannerisms spot-on.  What impresses me even more is the downright chemistry & effortless bond that those performers are able to convey of Johnny Cash and June Carter.  The movie has moments of flashback and it tracks down Johnny's gradual rise and downfall and his victory over his demon in a linear progression and along the way, we get to see Johnny's fascination with June since childhood, how their lives collided, how his persistency finally paid off in winning her heart over.  It's surreal to see his performances together with other prominent performers in the fifties such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis & Roy Orbinson.  Once again, in the special edition, the Director compiles individual performances of Johnny, June and the mentioned three performers into a jukebox sequences that can be enjoyed on its own merit.  The special edition also has interviews of Johnny's friends and relatives who talked about his faith, him as a person (and not simply a singer), the process of getting the real Johnny Cash and June Carter to approve of this movie (overall, it takes a decade to bring it into fruition) and also the making of Joaquin and Reese into the real stars.  A matured and heartfelt movie that's made with a lot of guts and love.  Mesmering to watch and highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>I'd bet i'd move it all a little farther down the line, far from Folsom Prison, thats where I want to stay.<br /><br />As I write this review I'm listening to Walk the Line soundtrack, Cocaine Blues, great song.  "I was dressed in black"  Sorry I'll try to refrain from writing any more song lines down.  Okay first of all, I think Joquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in this time.  I mean, I thought he was good in Gladiator and the Village, in this he should have got an Oscar.  Singing all of the songs and acting awesomely at the same time!  That deserves a ZOUNDS!<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon is very good too.  She doesn't sing as well as Joquin, but she still gives a great performance.  The movie chronicles his entire life from his rise to fame, to his struggle with drugs, to him rising up again.<br /><br />Overall watch this movie, it gave me a much better appreciation for Mr. Cash and his life.<br /><br />"You'll wake up some cold day and find your alone, you'll ask for me but I'm gonna tell you BYE BYE BYE, When I turn around and walk away your gonna CRY CRY CRY.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>I don't know anything at all about Johnny Cash - save for that 'Hurt' and 'Tennessee Stud' are two of my favourite songs, full stop - and so I didn't have any checkboxes to tick or things I really wanted to see done right in "Walk The Line".<br /><br />What I saw was a movie that's certainly restored some of my faith in big-budget Hollywood pictures, a 2-hour-plus treasure that manages to be insightful, entertaining and - most importantly - real.<br /><br />The two central performances given by Joaquin Phienix as Cash and Reece Witherspoon as June Carter are runaway successes: each actor, in very different ways, bring individual and plausible life to their characters - no mean feat, when you consider that these characters aren't simple fiction. Their onscreen chemistry is palpable and, jaded old movie watcher that I am, I found myself instantly accepting the bond that Phoenix and Witherspoon portray together. Surprisingly, the vocals are all theirs, too (thankfully! with a vocal style as distinctive and unmistakable as that of Johnny Cash, it would have been stupid to attempt to lip-synch, in my opinion), and here more praise must be heaped on the pair - not only can they sing these songs, they perform them with real spirit and energy.<br /><br />Another cast highlight is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash, giving an excellent performance as the nasty daddy - perhaps the only flaw of the movie's script is that it does not allow for much development of characters like Ray Cash or Vivian - but Patrick and Ginnifer Goodwin, insofar as they're able, don't allow their small parts to become two-dimensional, so it's not all bad news.<br /><br />Direction is great - James Mangold displays a real sense of affinity with the music hall style of C&W performance and, as with the rest of the picture, this comes across as a believable, plausible style. Musical numbers are kept nicely and wisely understated and the whole look and feel of the movie is very pared-back, but all the more rewarding because of this.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent character study: two amazing performances from the leads mean that a simplistic plot of boy-meets-girl-and-must-overcome-personal-demons-in-order-to-get-girl is showcased in a beautiful, satisfying and very real way.<br /><br />Wholly recommended. And I just went and bough my first ever Johnny Cash album, too!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>How two actors can transform themselves into country singers as convincingly as this is breathtaking, and to give such satisfying, spontaneous and riveting performances is amazing.<br /><br />Just watch the extended versions of the songs on Disc 2, particularly Reese in "Juke Box Blues", it seems she has completely forgotten who she is, she is just living June Carter, also the great duet of them singing "Jackson".<br /><br />Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash, he doesn't act or mimic him, he is him, watching his performance you can actually see a comment made in one of the extras that Cash "was the most haunted man I have ever met".<br /><br />This is no romantic biopic, it is a gritty slice of real life, the lives of Johnny Cash and June Carter.<br /><br />The extras on Disc 2 are every bit as good as the film in their different way, and the extended songs stand up as an album on their own. Buy, but make sure you BUY THE TWO DISC VERSION.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>A breakthrough of history and music down the hard and dirty journey of the original Johnny Cash. It enlightens you of how he got his start, what famous people he hung around with, what torments he had to suffer, and what he had to offer the world . . .a new sound.<br /><br />Jaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job in filling the big shoes of the rock legend. He's so convincing that, at times, I had to remember that he was an actor and not the real Johnny Cash. But, I would say that Jaquin Phoenix deserves an award for completely giving you the natural performance of Johnny Cash's life and memoirs. This movie made me fall in love with Bio-pics all over again.<br /><br />Reese witherspoon, in a depature from her regular movies, plays a convincing June Carter who is slightly interested in the mysterious, yet humble, sometimes crazy confident Johnny Cash.<br /><br />This movie is definetley for those who want to relive what it was like in the 1950's - 1960's when the dawn of a new sound in music emerged and said, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."<br /><br />It's a really great movie. A definite "must have."<br /><br />This movie makes the legend of Johnny Cash come alive!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" follows the life of country/rock star Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from the genesis of his career in the mid-1950s until his marriage to June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in 1968, as Cash develops his sound, struggles with his own frailties, and rock'n'roll emerges in Memphis against a bland landscape of American music. The film focuses on Cash's personal life and how his music expressed his conflicted personality, but we also see the legendary musicians of Sun Studios under producer Sam Philips: Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, with whom Johnny Cash and Tennessee Three, as well as June Carter, toured the nation. Glimpses of the those musicians evoke the a lifestyle in the early days of touring, when there were no buses, no roadies, and no sleep. I didn't find the film especially sympathetic to Cash's first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), but it is sensitive to June Carter's delicate position as a divorced woman very much in the public eye when divorce was not always acceptable.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon couldn't be better as off-and-on-again lovers Cash and Carter. Phoenix conveys Johnny Cash's eternal struggle to live up his ideals, his darkness, his love of music, and love for June Carter. Reese Witherspoon expresses Carter's commitment to working hard and pleasing her fans, sometimes through difficult circumstances and personal pain. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing, having trained for 3 months under the tutelage of music producer T-Bone Burnett, and they sound great. Musician roles in the film were cast with musicians, which lends some welcome authenticity. Writer and director James Mangold, along with co-writer Gill Dennis, have done a great job of packing a lot of material from the most turbulent period in Johnny Cash's life -and one of the most exciting times in American music- into an entertaining and insightful film. The events of the film are based on Johnny Cash's 2 autobiographies, and he and June Carter had the opportunity to approve the actors who portray them before they passed away in 2003.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer, a soundtrack promotional spot, and an audio commentary by director and co-writer James Mangold. Mangold's commentary is both personal and informative. He provides tidbits of additional historical information, talks about preparing for the film, details of filming, and the film's structure, as well as his conversations with Johnny Cash, his intentions and inspirations, and the film's themes as they reflect Cash's life and personality. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>WALK THE LINE, the Johnny Cash-June Carter story, is an exhilarating musical biography.  It starts in 1968 inside Folsom Prison, flashes back to Cash's childhood in the Deep South of the early 1950's, then works its way back up to 1968 and beyond.  With brilliant performances by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar nominee) and Reese Witherspoon (Oscar winner), Cash's life and music career come alive.  Both actors spent months learning how to do their own singing and guitar playing live before an audience, and it shows in the electrifying musical numbers.<br /><br />Director/co-writer James Mangold filmed the movie on location in Memphis, Nashville, and Arkansas along (I think) the Mississippi River.  The 1950's and 1960's sets and costumes, from my own childhood era, are perfection and should have been Oscar-nominated if they weren't.  The film runs 135 minutes, but between the concert scenes and period re-creation, I never wanted it to end.  If WALK THE LINE has any flaw, in fact, it is that it could have lasted longer for me and didn't just put three more decades of narrative crawls against a black finale background.  I wanted more music and more of the perfect Phoenix and Witherspoon performances.<br /><br />This may be one of the finest musical biographies I have ever seen.  The DVD includes a directors' commentary and 10 deleted scenes that help clarify scene and character. WALK THE LINE is a beautifully crafted labor of love movie gem.  It particularly deserved the Sound Mixing Oscar nomination for spectacular concert scenes.  The movie plays and sounds, inexplicably, way better on DVD than in a theater. It is an absolute must-see. NOTE: Made in Panavision; buy or rrent the widescreen version.  Amazon.com is selling it at half-price.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I walked into this movie and within a few minutes I wsa drawn in and completly engrossed in what proved to be one of the best films I have seen this year.  For a year as depressing as this one with maybe three or four movies really reaching me (Cinderella Man is by far the best movie to come out this year followed by this film, Crash, Batman Begins, Saw II and the ever under-appreciated Domino) I was so happy to walk out of a film feeling glad that I went.  Joaquin puts on a performance of a career and is a lock for the Best Actor nomination (with all the talk Hoffmans getting for Capote I doubt Phoenix will win, but he WILL be nominated) and Witherspoon is PERFECT as June Carter, almost even more perfect in her role than Joaquin was that her nomination may result in a win.  I never knew that much about the life of Johnny Cash, and I never really listened to his music, I mean I knew the song Ring of Fire...but after watching this movie I have a newfound respect for the man.  I've heard that the daughter or Cash and his first wife threw a fit about the way her mother was portrayed and that it was false...but you know that with EVERY biopic there are libertys taken, but these libertys do not take away from the feel of the film.  By the end you will be in tears and you will come to appreciate the man that is now the legend...</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>This is a film for everyone, but especially for the Baby Boomers.  Baby Boomers lived through the career of Johnny Cash and will experience the feeling that they are seeing history in the making.  I know you should be quiet in the theatre, but I kept leaning over to my college-aged son and saying, "I remember this." and "Do you know who THAT person is?" etc.  Part way through the film, I stopped leaning over, because I was secretly wiping tears from my eyes.  This film is extremely powerful.  There are films you rent, and films you watch in the theatre, and films you plop down hard earned money for the privilege of owning.  This film is worth owning.<br /><br />Now realize, these are the words of a Baby Boomer here.  My son is of a different generation.  As we left the theatre I asked him, "Well, what did you think?"  His response, "It's probably as good as Harry Potter."  Wow!  I guess this may be a film for all ages.<br /><br />ONE REQUEST . . . To Whom it May Concern:  Johnny Cash had a LOT of life (perhaps the best part) AFTER his marriage to June Carter.  If anyone chooses to make a sequel to this film, I'll be there.  This film is good, but it is only part A of what should be a two-parter.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix probably would have won the Oscar for his portrayal of Johnny Cash in "Walk the Line" if only Jamie Foxx hadn't won the prize a year earlier for playing Ray Charles. The Oscars didn't want to look like the Grammys, so they gave the golden guy to Philip Seymour Hoffman for a less complex performance as Truman Capote.<br /><br />Phoenix is better, though (and does his own singing), and director James Mangold, in a commentary, praises the actor unabashedly. One of the most memorable scenes has Cash watching from the wings as Elvis Presley (played by Tyler Hilton) wows a crowd of screaming teenagers. Without uttering a single word, Phoenix conveys a range of emotions. At first, he's admiring. Then he appears momentarily jealous of qualities Elvis has that are lacking in his own performance. Finally, he shakes off any feelings of envy he may have and is once more admiring, much too impressed with his colleague to let petty feelings intrude.<br /><br />Biopics tend to follow a too predictable path, an unavoidable template when dealing with the kind of lives considered worthy of cinematic treatment. There's the early life and its troubles often depicted as providing the impetus for the subject's later success. There's the scene in which the hero discovers his talent or calling and struggles to effectively develop or present it to whomever (in this case, Sun Records' producer Sam Phillips) holds the power to bring it to the world. Then you've got the predictable rise and, sometimes, the fall. "Walk the Line" doesn't stray from the formula yet makes the cliches of the genre seem fresh because they allow Johnny Cash to appear not merely as a legend, an almost Mount Rushmore figure in popular music, but as a man full of doubts about his talent and his soul, and Phoenix captures him superbly.<br /><br />Cash never really had a downfall comparable to Elvis Presley's, but he struggled with addiction, only overcoming his demons through the love of June Carter. He had career setbacks, but the film ends before Cash was dumped from the Columbia label and also stops short of detailing his eventual return to glory through the series of brooding recordings he made for producer Rick Rubin's American Recordings. It's a fine, superbly realized film, a testament to both the legend of its subject, and to the talents of its stars.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I have had mixed feelings about the artist Johnny Cash.  There's no question that he was an impressive young talent in his early years.  That Sun Record group was a great collection of musicians.  Like just about everybody else, I was impressed with his Folsom Prison album.  I've considered "Folsom Prison Blues" a bold classic of Country Western music.  However, in the years after that stage in his life, I sensed a gradual decline of talent.  In the years before his passing, I thought it a shame than no one took him aside to point out that he'd lost his singing voice.  Some of the later commercials he lent that "singing" voice to were as embarassing as some of the scenes in "Walk the Line".  There's no question, however, that Johnny Cash had a life that was worthy of a major motion picture.  Fortunately, "Walk the Line" was worthy of its' subject.<br /><br />The movie begins with a look at tragedy and dysfunction in Cash's youth.  It does an excellent job of providing illuminating vignettes of his young adult years and his start in music.  Eventually he becomes a star and the fame and fortune becomes too much.  His first marriage is examined with the sort of balance that comes from having his children involved in the production of the movie.  In a dramatic scene of confrontation, Cash tells his first wife "You're not perfect either" after getting an earful of what his faults are.  We know just enough about her to know he's right (and she's right as well).  The emerging relationship with June Carter is the real focus of the movie and that, too, was well developed.  It took a lot of patience, however, with the self-destructive life style Cash was leading.  The concert at Folsom Prison served as the defining point in the movie.  It was a statement that Cash knew he had shared the past of many in his audience and, although he changed his life to avoid their present and future, he made no appologies about the hard lessons he learned.  With all the intenseity this movie contains, I was surprized that the closing scene was the one that impressed me the most.  Kudos to director James Mangold for giving us a glimpse of homelife banality as a way of saying "All is well".</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Movie biopics are generally problematic: how do you get all or a major portion of a person's life on the screen in more or less than 2 hours? How do you do justice to anyone's life in 120 minutes?<br />There have been good examples of course, but most of them have been good because the writer or director has wisely chosen to telescope/hone in on a relatively short portion of a subject's life: Billie Holiday's in "Lady Sings the Blues" or Truman Capote's in "Capote." Both films, I realize with wildly different results, but both equally effective because the focus of each has been telescoped and better stated...microscoped onto a short portion of each life: both Truman Capote and Billie Holiday have been revealed and analyzed and effectively appreciated through the learned and discretionary eye of someone who effectively separates the legend from the reality.<br />Director James Mangold (the quirky "Heavy" and the effective "The Yards") would not seem a logical choice to direct a probing film about Johnny Cash (an audaciously effective Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter ( a wonderful Reese Witherspoon) but he does manage most of the time to steer away from the maudlin and melodramatic and in the process comes up with a good, straight-forward biopic of the two.<br />The obvious comparison to "Walk The Line" would be the recent "Ray" but whereas Jamie Foxx's recreation of Ray Charles borders on caricature and mimicry, Phoenix's Cash always seems and feels organic: he doesn't so much as inhabit Cash's spirit and persona as interpret it. Phoenix not only uses his own voice to sing the songs...he uses his own psychic voice to creep inside of Cash to reveal the Cash inside of Phoenix and the Phoenix inside of Cash and this translates into a thrilling, revealing portrait of the two.<br />Witherspoon also does her own singing and because we know a lot less of Carter's life, manufactures and makes real a character that is both simple and straightforward as well as one who, though she loves and admires her talented and famous family, longs for her own place in the world in general and in the entertainment world specifically: she is less wounded than Cash but equally on the lookout for personal and professional validation.<br />"Walk The Line" is not the best movie ever made but it certainly is not the worst. The best biopics require strong, incandescent performances at their core and "WTL"has that in spades with Phoenix and Witherspoon's revolutionary recreations/interpretations of Cash and Carter.<br />Enter the world of "Walk The Line" with an open mind and heart and you will be rewarded with both a noble and novel interpretation of two lives and two people who dared to be talented and blessed in a world that often attempted to stamp out and diffuse those that were different in favor of mediocrity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This is quite simply a brilliant film, with superb performances by Phoenix and Wetherspoon. I knew nothing about Johnny Cash before this film, but feel I've come away with some understanding of the man as well as a real appreciation of his music. This follows his life up until he married June Carter and explores his childhood, first marriage, rise to the top of the music industry and his struggles with drug abuse. The music is great and makes for an excellent introduction to Johnny Cash's work. This film kept me interested the whole way through, and left me wanting to find out more. This is also well worth a viewing even if you know nothing of Cash or aren't a big fan of country music, it can be watched as a human interest story in it's own right, but you will leave it captivated by the man. Simply excellent!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I'm anything but a Johnny Cash fan. The only time I got a kick out of his music was in the late Sixties (or early Seventies?), when he released his tongue-in-cheek hit, "Boy Named Sue."  Very entertaining, in case you haven't heard it.  Otherwise, I paid scant attention to the Man in Black, other than knowing he sang about trains, and crime, and prison, and that he was a tad rambunctious.<br /><br />So when WALK THE LINE initially came out, my interest wasn't all that keen on learning about the troubled life of Cash (or his equally tumultuous romance with June Carter).  Two words got me to go see the film during its theatrical run--and to watch this exceptional movie several times since:  Joaquin Phoenix.  I'm a big fan of this remarkable, versatile actor, have been ever since seeing him in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a>.  And in Cash's biopic Phoenix doesn't disappoint:  he immerses himself in the character, becomes the troubled Man in Black--right down to the singer's deep baritone.  Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as the ever-aloof June Carter (ultimately June Carter Cash); Witherspoon is dead on, from June's feisty sassiness, to her twang and drawl.<br /><br />It's one thing not to appreciate the actual music--it's quite another to be blown away when two actors absolutely nail the actual music.  That's what makes WALK THE LINE such a great film:  it's completely, unequivocally, believable.  Further kudos go out to Robert Patrick, who plays Cash's forever-disapproving father (the Denethor of the Ozarks).  So don't let not being a fan of Johnny Cash keep you from seeing this film; if you haven't checked out WALK THE LINE, by all means do so.  And get rhythm, when you get the blues.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Despite the fact that `Ray' was just released the year prior to critical acclaim, even winning an Oscar or two, and the fact that the life story of Johnny Cash is in a way very similar the film `Walk the Line' does a brilliant job of making this life story all that much more compelling and entertaining than last years submission.  This is due in large part to the fantastic performances of the entire cast, most notably Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and the Oscar snubbed Ginnifer Goodwin who brilliantly balances support, frustration and sympathy as Cash's ex wife Vivian.  James Mangold has that same eye for detail as Hackford possessed in `Ray' but he ups the ante by fleshing out not only the demons that corrupted Cash's soul but also the angel that saved him in the end, notably June Carter.<br /><br />Right off the bat we are introduced to the Cash household and immediately the lines are drawn as in who the supportive parent and who the dominating overbearing parent is, and when the tragic death of Johnny's older brother shakes things up within that household no one is ever truly the same afterward.  Racked with guilt for not being there when he was hurt and or being the surviving sibling Johnny lived the majority of his life with suppressed grief and constant dissatisfaction with any of his many accomplishments.  The film beautifully flows through his adolescent life in the army, his early life married sweetheart Vivian and then the early points in his career until fame and fortune drove Johnny to drugs and, you guessed it, women.<br /><br />But it was one woman who stole his heart and cured his soul, and that was June Carter, played brilliantly by Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.  Her charisma, charm and sincerity helped tame a tortured man and gave him reason to believe in himself and in the prospect of living a happy and fulfilling life once and for all.  The film chronicles their love affair from its rocky start, shaky middle and everlasting end and it does so with such elegance and patience that the viewer becomes so invested in these characters as people and we begin to sympathize, rationalize and relate to their very souls.  Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with as he attacks Cash's very being with such reverence and determination that I felt I witnessed the birth of a true star, and Witherspoon earned her Oscar with the same fiery determination evident in her co-star.<br /><br />The supporting players all pull their weight as well, from Ginnifer Goodwin's Oscar worthy performance to Robert Patrick's sinister father, the man we loathe in entirety yet learn isn't without saving, as well as the entire cast of young actors and musicians all help create a feeling and a mood that perfectly compliments the films purpose.  Not a single performance is forced, out of place or unworthy of mention.<br /><br />Another highlight is the music, all of which was sung by the actual actors themselves, which is another step-up from last years `Ray'.  Both Joaquin and Reese devour each sung line with enthusiasm and pure talent and it also helps cement them into their characters, fleshing out both Johnny and June and making them more real.  These are in no way shape or form mere imitations.  Both Phoenix and Witherspoon created these characters brilliantly and beautifully.  From the accurate sets to the costumes and stage performances `Walk the Line' is a fantastic biopic complete with acting bravado and a script that truly brings these legends to life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>We watched this multiple Academy Award nominee on DVD, having missed it in the theatre.  My daughter is a big Reese Witherspoon fan and my wife grew up near Nashville--so the movie seemed like a good fit.  I didn't find anything terribly wrong with it.  At one level it seemed a lot like "Ray", the biopic of Ray Charles, but maybe that's just because the lives of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles traveled similar paths.  The most surprising thing to me was all the fuss about Witherspoon's performance--she was a consensus favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar and did so.  Her singing was a nice surprise, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix was much stronger in his role as Johnny Cash.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver two of the greatest performances of recent memory in this powerful film about one of country music's biggest stars: Johnny Cash.<br /><br />Young Johnny took an early interest in music while growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm during the great depression of the 1930s.  He was very close to his older brother, Jack, but his father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was extremely strict with young John and forbade him from listening to the radio.  John looked to Jack for love and support, but Jack died in a freak table saw accident, leaving young John alone.  John's guilt is not helped when his father blames him for the accident, saying that the wrong son died.<br /><br />During the Korean conflict, John enlisted in the air force and was sent to Germany.  There, he saw a film about Folsom Prison.  Moved by the film, John wrote a song entitled "Folsom Prison Blues".  Upon his discharge from the air force, John returned to the United States and married his girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).  After the marriage, John tried (unsuccessfully) to make a living as a door-to-door salesman.  His heart was really in music, and he managed to get an audition with Sun Records executive Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).  Initially, the audition went poorly, as John and his group stuck to gospel music.  Sam informed the group that people were tired of listening to gospel and asked John if he had any other music to play.  John responded by playing "Folsom Prison Blues" and his career took off.<br /><br />After the success of the audition, John and his band began a tour with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, but there was one particular person who caught John's eye: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Although there was an attraction between the two, both were married to other people at the time.  But the chemistry was definitely there, as evidenced by their magic on-stage performances of such great songs as "Jackson", "Walk the Line", and "Ring of Fire" (which was written by June).  The two toured on and off for several years, and the strain began to take its toll on John.  By the time the decade of the 1960s began, John was fighting a battle against amphetamines.  His marriage to Vivian ended and he sought help from June to overcome his drug problem.  He moved into a new lakefront home after his divorce from Vivian.  While fighting his drug problem, he spent a great deal of time reading letters from prison inmates.  These letters led him to take an idea of a live concert from Folsom Prison to the executives at Columbia Records.  Initially rebuffed, John told them that they could destroy the tapes if they didn't like the live recording.  However, John's "Live At Folsom Prison" went on to become one of the biggest-selling albums ever made.<br /><br />After the Folsom Prison concert, John, June, and the others went to Ontario, Canada for another concert.  During the performance of "Jackson", John asked June to marry him.  He had asked her many times before, but was  turned down each time.  This time, however, June said yes, and they were married for 35 years until both passed away in 2003.  They spent their time with their families at the lake house fishing and enjoyng their family.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are simply perfect as Johnny and June, and both do their own singing in the movie.  Joaquin sounds exactly like Johnny did, and Reese was the perfect choice to play June.  Her voice is excellent as well.  The acting throughout the movie is great, and the songs bring back many memories.  Its easy to see why this movie was such a hit with so many movie critics.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see the rise and struggles of a country music legend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>This is the best big budget, big screen biopic I've seen since "Kinsey", another film that tried to define its lead character through the poor relationship he had with his father.<br /><br />In "Walk the Line", Joaquin Phoenix plays rock-country superstar Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon plays wife June Carter Cash. What most distinguishes this biopic is the wonderful singing of the two leads, who do their own voicing for their parts. Phoenix is remarkable as Cash and Witherspoon somewhat less so as Carter Cash.<br /><br />The movies takes us from Cash's early boyhood, where his father chides God for taking the wrong son when John's brother dies, through his drug addicted adulthood and failed first marriage, up to the point where he and Carter tied the knot in 1968. They lived together 35 years and died within a few months of each other in 2003.<br /><br />The movie also includes characterizations of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley, both of whom apparently came of age in the Memphis music scene with Cash and Carter. The film effectively portrays the rigors of the music business in the 1950s with its night after night stops, groupies, bus travel, drinking, drugs and partying, and the way this wears down people and relationships (both Cash and Carter had failed marriages related to their music lifestyles.)<br /><br />For me, the best part of this picture is the singing. It is universally effective in a toe tapping mood. The movie would have been about half as good without the music. In this regard, Witherspoon was much better here than in "Vanity Fair", where her singing of 1800 music was consistently behind the beat and off-key. Phoenix was a near double for Cash, a fellow that was easy to mimic.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>WALK THE LINE focuses primarily on the early career (1955-1968) of Johnny Cash, Country Music's legendary Man In Black.<br /><br />Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is raised by an emotionally distant father, an ineffectual mother, and is haunted by the death of his brother Jack in his early teens. Starting out from Arkansas as a ne'er do well, Cash does a brief stint in the Air Force and works as a door-to-door salesman before taking his amateur band into Nashville's legendary Sun Records to take his first steps on the road to stardom.<br /><br />Playing in a succession of honky-tonks, school gyms, and other seedy venues, Cash hones his craft on endless and huge road tours in the company of such other rising stars as Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Elvis Presley. His growing popularity with his female fans puts breaking strains on his marriage. Along the way, he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) of the famous Carter family. The two begin a tempestuous on-again off-again relationship that is punctuated by Johnny's bouts of heavy drinking, amphetamine abuse and womanizing, as well as June's emotional travail at being an absent twice-divorced mother of two young girls.<br /><br />Witherspoon, known for her fluffy comedies, won the Best Actress Oscar for devouring the scenery as the deep, emotionally complex, feisty but firm June Carter, who refuses Cash's constant entreaties to marry him, argues him into responsibility, drops him when his behavior goes over the line, and is there absolutely as Johnny battles his demons, kicks the amphetamines, and at last confronts his vicious father. Cash finally walks the line, mostly because of Carter. More than lovers, the two are best friends.<br /><br />Although Phoenix did not win Best Actor for Cash, his performance is on a par with Witherspoon's. Starting out a bit tentatively, Phoenix's portrayal of Cash gains freight-train momentum as the film progresses, until at the end, Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash. His concert at Folsom Prison is electrifying and profoundly real.<br /><br />Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the songs, and do it amazingly well. Their performance reaches its crescendo at the close of the film, when Johnny proposes (for the seventieth time) to June onstage in Ontario, and she at last says yes.<br /><br />Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash remained married from 1968 until their deaths, weeks apart, in 2003. Loving best friends, they stayed together even then.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Not having been a fan of Johnny Cash my entire life, I didn't have any of his life details to compare while watching the movie.  I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.<br /><br />Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.  She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception.<br /><br />In short, I liked the film.  Not a movie I plan on watching repeatedly, but it was worth the time to see.  I recommend it highly, even if like me, you know little or nothing about the singer.  This film is worth the time invested.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I need to listen to more Johnny Cash.  I haven't heard much of his music, but after seeing Walk The Line, which shows his rise, fall, and rebirt, I realize that I am missing out.<br /><br />Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up on a farm.  His father Ray (Robert Patrick) always liked Johnny's older brother more, seeing Johnny as good for nothing, and throwing his life away listening to the Carter family sing on the radio.  After Johnny's brother died, Ray blamed Johnny.<br /><br />While in the air force, Cash began writing songs about being in prison, despite having never been incarcerated himself.  Upon his return to the States, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), despite her father's protests and fears that Cash wouldn't be able to provide for her.  And at first, he can't.  He is too preoccupied with becoming a music star that he can't concentrate on his door-to-door sales job.  Finally, he decides to take his band, which, according to Vivian, is composed of two mechanics who can't play well, to a recording studio run by Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), owner of Sun Records.  Some of the other artists Phillips signed include Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings).  While on tour, Johnny meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who was one of his idols while growing up.  She still sings, but she also performs comedy sideshow routines between the "real" musicians.  As Johnny and June get to know each other while they tour together, an attraction forms between them, and they become best friends.  While this is fine for June, who is also married, Johnny wants more.  Soon, he also gets into drugs, which eventually get him kicked off a tour when he forgets the lyrics to his songs and kicks out the footlights on stage.  Meanwhile, his homelife continues to get worse.  Vivian isn't very supportive of him during his dark days (I'm told that the real Vivan Cash was more supportive than portrayed here, but I guess the film needed to make a few adjustments for the purposes of drama), and she becomes very jealous of June's relationship with her husband.  Eventually, Johnny drives away everyone he loves; his wife, his three daughters, and his band.  The only person who sticks by him during his darkest times is June.<br /><br />While I'm sure that some of the events were a little embellished (as I already said, Vivan's character was a little off), these are all real events and they are as exciting as even some the best fictional love stories.  June's committment to her best friend is amazing, and Johnny's struggle, while not unique, is definitely trying for everyone involved.<br /><br />Phoenix and Witherspoon deserve special recognition for their performances here.  Both of them nailed their characters so well.  Phoenix was able to perfectly imitate Cash's trademark deep voice and both of them did their own singing!  Every actor involved did very well, but these two were amazing.  It's too bad that Witherspoon gets stuck in so many silly romantic comedies, because she is truly wasting her talent in them.<br /><br />Biopics aren't my favorite genre of films, but this one stands out as one of the greatest I've ever seen.  It's got a great story as well as an amazing soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" isn't just an admirable improvisation; it is a great movie.  Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) live out the classic love story.  He is in love with her, but she is usually unavailable or uninterested.  There are other fascinating storylines available, too.  The movie illuminates his difficult childhood with his brother's tragedy and his father's abuse.  We also feel the anguish of an artist before he becomes famous.  He must start with an unfulfilling marriage and an unrewarding sales job before he gets to become fulfilled in life.  The steps after success aren't always uplifting either.  He goes through infidelity, drinking, and drug abuse before he sees the light of what success and happiness can really garner.<br /><br />Perenially, it has been said that the performances in "Walk the Line" are remarkable.  True enough.  The story's presentation is marvelous, though, too.  It could have been assembled any way, but we start and end with the "Folsum Prison" concert, creating the anticipation and closure we need.  The country music performances are intertwined with scenes about John and June's relationship, and all of it is worthwhile.  While many comments have been made about Joaquin's reinactment of the music, it is engaging enough to work well.  (Subjectively, one of the best scenes in the movie is when Joaquin and Reese perform "It Ain't Me Babe," a Bob Dylan song.)  "Walk the Line" is an excellent movie that doesn't require the viewer to like country music (although it certainly helps). The movie is a sincere and flattering portrait of an honest and uncompromising man who was genuine and human enough to represent the tragedies and concerns of all people who struggle in daily life.  The movie doesn't make a legend, but it certainly celebrates one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>I did not know too much about Johnny and June Carter Cash before going to see Walk the Line. When I left I was a reluctant fan.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon did a phenomenal job as the two lovebirds and I thought that they both did a great job singing in the movie as well considering neither of them had sung professionally before.<br /><br />At times the movie could be sad, sometimes a little boring, but the two actors made me believe that they really were John and June Carter Cash. The rest of the supporting characters were also very good and made this movie very nice to watch</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>Now I see why Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar. The story of Johnny Cash is in some ways a typical one-abusive father, beaten down child, escapes into the music world, tries to be a family man but the rigors of the road lead him into drugs and alcohol. Typical but for Cash's incredible luck in having run into June Carter, who, with her family, forces him to get off the pills. Witherspoon in this movie goes from being the silly, cute "Legally Blond"  type to becoming the most loyal of friends, but tough too. Apparently both Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing-Witherspoon is no singer, and I thought her first number was just a poor dubbing job, but this didn't ruin it for me for a second. If you don't like country music you'll find this drags in spots, but overall it's an engrossing story.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>While it was not my favorite music biopic, it certainly was interesting.  While I have liked Cash's music, I never knew that much about his life.  At first I was not sure of Phoenix in the role, but when he began to sing he became Cash.  The voice is dead on, as well as the movement and speach patterns.  Reese also does a commendable job in singing all of her own songs as well.  The movie ends 35 years before his death, so it doesn't cover the later part of his life.  That's okay though, since Cash lived enough in his early years to fill 3 lifetimes.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Two superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make the bio-pic of Johnny Cash `Walk the Line' a highly engaging and absorbing drama about him and his love June Carter. Without two leads, the film might have become a shallow melodrama about music and love that you have seen on screen many times before. As it is, in spite of the weak supporting roles and several mistakes that betray the not-so-sure hand of the director James Mangold (`Girl, Interrupted'), 'Walk the Line' is a moving story about Johnny Cash and June Carter.<br /><br />Though the film is full of great Johnny Cash songs, `Walk the Line' is more about the long-time romance of a gifted musician, and like any romance with gifted musician, it is full of romance and emotional turmoil. The film begins with the tragic event that happened in the childhood of the artist (like `Ray'), but the real film starts when we meet Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, whose less restrained and moralistic attitude to life than that of his wife inevitably attract Johnny Cash.<br /><br />Johnny Cash songs sometimes reveal the troubled soul of sinner or criminal with the darkly engaging lyrics. Credible acting from Joaquin Phoenix and several episodes depicted in the film explain the reason for this darker nature of his songs, but still many things are left out. While his distant father (Robert Patrick) convincingly shows the reason for the guilt-ridden mind seen in his songs and himself, supporting characters like his mother, his first wife, and his children are relegated to near ciphers. Still the strong performance from Reese Witherspoon compensates for the occasional slack in the script.<br /><br />As a fan of oldies, it is good to see the legendary artists of Sun Label such as Jerry Lee Lewis or Roy Orbison again even though they are played by someone else. The director somehow thought that to cast real singers are a better idea than to cast actors, and we see Waylon Malloy Payne and Jonathan Rice as Lewis and Orbison. I know this is only a small flaw, but I wish for my favorite musicians' roles someone who really looks like them.<br /><br />But essentially `Walk the Line' is a film for Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both perfectly in character as Johnny and June. It is hard not to be moved by the conclusion and the energetic soundtrack of Johnny Cash numbers with thumping guitar riff.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>Alright, let's cut to the end of the page: there is literally nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before. In fact, it's pretty much the same thing as "Ray" from the previous year, only with more subdued and less hammy performances. This movie was meant to be Oscar bait, and Reese Witherspoon did indeed walk away with a statuette, so mission accomplished. That being said...<br /><br />Walk the Line is the Johnny Cash biopic, and within the quite codified conventions of the biopic (especially musical biopic) genre, it is quite good, at times, even excellent. If you didn't see this movie in the theaters, you missed quite a show, because the musical numbers here are something that most home audio systems won't be able to replicate. The director, James Mangold, does an outstanding job of staging these sequences, and it is easy to see how Cash's music electrified listeners at the time. It even delivered a sizable jolt to me, and I generally dislike country music (most music, for that matter). Joaquin Phoenix and Witherspoon are magnificent on stage, I suppose that technically they are better singers than the performers they are playing. Since the music is one of the big draws, I figured I would comment separately on it and just say that this part is fantastically executed.<br /><br />As for the rest of it...credit Mangold and his screenwriters for not folding in every musical biopic cliche into their movie. There's no Freudian back door that conveniently wraps up everything, as in "Ray", which was completely untrue as to Charles' problems in real life. There is a groaner when Witherspoon tells Cash, "You cain't walk no line," after a drunken, drugged-up, all-night jam session with his band. Still, this is familiar territory for anyone who as seen a biopic or gets VH-1 on their TV. The execution is better than most, but people who come to watch a completely original story or want to find some sort of message will be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, this movie succeeds at what it tries to be, and for that, I give it 4 stars. One gripe though: even though Reese Witherspoon's Oscar was deserved, just looking at the last couple of years' worth of Oscar wins shows a pattern that anyone who is not a "serious" actor that plays a pop culture celebrity and does a good impersonation seems to be a shoo-in for an Oscar. I guess Jim Carrey's only mistake wasn't that he wasn't as good as the guy that won, he just picked out the wrong role--maybe a biopic about the secret inner life of David Bowie would get him some gold? Seriously, imitation can win awards, but let's tone it down, before Jamie Foxx wins Oscar #2 for "Stevie". Bunz singing "Cherie Amor". God help us.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>Simply a fantastic movie.  Reese and Joaquin absolutely own the screen in this exceptional movie.  Stunning in itself, but made even more so by the fact that the two leads did their own singing.  This lent to the authenticity of the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>This movie is incredible.  Joaquin was perfect as Johnny Cash and Reese clocks in with yet another great performance.  The music is excellent.  I would recommend making a purchase of this.  I think this is one of the best DVD releases this year so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>The film is most likely going to get comparisons to Ray, the biopic about Ray Charles starring Oscar winner Jamie Foxx. That's unfortunate since personally I liked this film more. Granted you might find similarities with the films but only because the legend's lives just happened to go across similar paths. Ray to me would've fell apart if it wasn't for Jamie Foxx. Walk the Line meanwhile works with everything.<br /><br />After a quick clip of Folsom Prison concert, the films opens with Johnny Cash as a youngin living at home with his brother and parents. Johnny(called J.R) is out fishing while his brother works with a saw. An accident happens and his brother dies which only confirms that his father doesn't think much of him. The film then jumps to Johnny in the Air Force as he's starting to write music. He eventually starts writing and gets some popularity but the important part is he met June Carter, a divorced mother of 2. Johnny gets impulsive about his feelings which she rejects while trying to help him with his addictions.<br /><br />The film wins thanks to its 2 leads with Joaquin Phoenix pulling off a great portrayal of the Men in Black while Reese Witherspoon(who hasn't really done much well known dramatic work) brings a spunk to June. While you might listen to Ray's soundtrack which largely had Jamie Foxx lip synching, Joaquin and Reese did their own singing and while it's not dead on, it's quite impressive to hear them. Listening to "I Walk the Line" in the film was like wow, he's quite good.<br /><br />In a way it's probably one of the better examples of a real-life love story. Not big goo-goo eyes with the occasional fight, this has heartbreak, pain, anguish and everything else that goes along with. Johnny goes through so much to win her back and just as far when she rejects him. Unlike Ray which had multiple wives, here it's the affections for one while trying to deal with a less-than-happy other. We end up liking it more rather than just "wife #3".<br /><br />There's much to like about Walk the Line, from its performances to its rock music, it's a fascinating insight to a legend's life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>From the opening moment when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) stares reminiscently at a saw blade, "Walk the Line" goes for the heart as it paints a vivid portrait of the Man in Black and woman, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) who saved his life.  The films' biopic clich&eacute;s (drugs and darkness to redemption, divorce to true love, unreasonable christian guilt to transcendent peace) aren't what do it, but the dynamic and deeply felt acting of Phoenix and Witherspoon.  The chemistry these two achieve, aided immeasurably by director James Mangold and music guru T-Bone Burnett, is magnetic.  Phoenix reflects Cash's demons and scarred soul, his eyes stark windows into Cash's wounded but then redeemed heart.  And Reese Witherspoon is dynamite as the sassy and strong-willed June Carter, who dealt with her own marital difficulties as she fell for the man who had her at "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."  The pair own the movie.  However, they owe two supporting players a load of credit.  Robert Patrick is terrific as Cashs' uncaring father, matching Phoenix blow for blow in a pivotal thanksgiving scene where long held resentments stemming the death of Cash's older brother simmer up to the surface.  And Gennifer Goodwin as Cash' first wife is stellar as well, playing the woman who bore the brunt of Cash's drug abuse and infidelity.  A biopic that resonates, "Walk The Line" sticks with genuine emotion.  Hand over the Oscars now.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Phoenix is great as Cash. He has the look and the voice. The same can be said for Witherspoon. The plot is good and interesting, but it gets a little boring at some moments. The movie has great music and a good feel. Oscar material.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This past weekend I was able to watch this film and Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.<br /><br />And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich&eacute;d bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own "character", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.<br /><br />The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have to admit they generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. Rarely I feel that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.<br /><br />This film far exceeded my expectations and with a true feeling of satisfaction.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>In WALK THE LINE, Joaquin Phoenix shows that he's come a long way since his role as the crazy Caesar in GLADIATOR.<br /><br />Those going into WALK THE LINE thinking it's a comprehensive film bio of Johnny Cash may perhaps come out slightly disappointed. While there's a relative brief sequence of his early years growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm, an even briefer sequence of his time in the Air Force in the early 50s, the film really begins in 1955 when, failing as a door-to-door salesman and wannabe gospel singer, he cuts a rock 'n' roll record for Sun Studios in Memphis and his career as a CW crooner takes off. The film ends with his marriage to June Carter in 1968. In between, against the backdrop of early hits, it focuses on his failed marriage to first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), his self-destructive abuse of amphetamines, and rocky relationship with singer/actress Carter (Reese Witherspoon), a twice-divorced single mother of two.<br /><br />The real treat of WALK THE LINE is watching Phoenix and Witherspoon amaze with Oscar-caliber dramatic performances. Who would have suspected that the latter was capable of anything other than light comedy?<br /><br />In case you haven't seen the film and you're wondering, Phoenix and Witherspoon themselves sing the Cash/Carter material; they're surprisingly effective. Mind you, I've never been such a Cash fan that I've possessed any of his albums, and I've only previously downloaded one of his songs ("City of New Orleans"). Indeed, when Phoenix and Witherspoon recreate the Cash/Carter duet of "Jackson", my first thought was: Didn't Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood do that?<br /><br />Coming out of the screening, my wife remarked that Phoenix sounded very much like Johnny himself. My response was a non-committal but prudent "Mmmm". Back home at the computer, I downloaded a couple more Cash songs, including his "Jackson" duet with Carter. To my ears, the real Cash had a singing voice that was slightly hoarser, and with a more pronounced slow drawl than Joaquin's version. While that doesn't detract from the actor's performance, it may cause purists to grumble.<br /><br />The film's opening scene is of two guards on a tower at Folsom Prison listening to the bass "thump, thump, thump" washing over the prison yard from the hall in which Cash is about to perform his famous concert before the inmates. My wife and I were sitting in the front row of the studio screening theater and the sound reverberated through our bones. I knew then that WALK THE LINE was going to be an exceptional film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I had a feeling that I would really like "Walk the Line," but I had no idea that is was such an AMAZING film! I didn't know Joaquin Phoenix had it in him. He did an incredible job bringing Johnny Cash to life. The movie chronicles Cash's rise to fame, his severe drug problem, and his relationship with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Phoenix and Witherspoon are PHENOMENAL! It would not be possible for anyone to portray Johnny and June with more accuracy, and their singing is FABULOUS! This movie is such a wonderful tribute to Cash's life and music, and it's also a beautiful love story. (I completely teared up during the final concert scene at the end of the film...how romantic!) In addition to Phoenix and Witherspoon, the supporting cast boasts excellent performances by Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife, Vivian, and Robert Patrick as Johnny's father. Everything about this movie is perfect...I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time!<br /><br />A lot of great movies were released last year, but "Walk the Line" was definitely one of the better ones...it is a MASSIVE OVERSIGHT that the film wasn't rewarded with a Best Picture nomination by the Academy Awards committee. Hopefully Phoenix and Witherspoon will walk away with the top honors, though...they definitely deserve it.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>It could be said that "Walk the line" is a movie about the life of Johnny Cash, a very well-known American artist that overcame all kinds of difficulties to become famous and share his music with the public. However, it would be more accurate to point out that this film is centered both on Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and the love they had for each other.<br /><br />The opening sequence is wonderful, and will make you realize that you weren`t wrong in choosing to watch "Walk the line". That feeling is likely to be specially strong if, like me, you don't really know a lot about Johnny Cash, and just want to watch a good and entertaining film. Notwithstanding that, you will also end up learning quite a few things about one of the most important American musicians of all time, and about a period in which many conventions were being broken by new artists.<br /><br />This film tells the spectator about Johnny Cash's childhood and his bad relationship with his father (played by Robert Patrick), his time in the Air Force, and the beginnings of his music career, when he met people like Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Elvis (Tyler Hilton), and the love of his life, singer June Carter. There was a big problem though: Cash was already married to another woman, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), something that June didn't forget, and repeated to Johnny every time she rejected his attempts to go beyond a friendship.<br /><br />The scenes where Johnny struggles with his addiction to drugs and with depression are quite difficult to watch, probably due to the fact that Joaquin Phoenix delivers a splendid performance. Reese Witherspoon is also outstandingly good as June, the person that saves Johnny Cash from himself.<br /><br />All the same, I want to mention that "Walk the line" is not all about drama. There are funny moments too, and also some wonderful scenes recreating Johnny's concerts that allow you to listen to the real deal. Oh well, maybe not the real deal, because Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing, but their version of those concerts is an extremely good one. I am seriously thinking about buying not only a cd with Cash's more important songs, but also another with the soundtrack of this movie. Listening to Phoenix singing "Folsom Prison Blues" is no hardship!<br /><br />On the whole, I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough. It is not perfect, but it is the kind of movie that you simply must see and enjoy. No regrets  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I'm always a little hesitant to watch biographical films such as Walk the Line, especially when they are based on someone I consider a personal favorite.  Johnny Cash was the man - then, now, and forever.  Heck, the one and only album my parents and I both own is Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.  I didn't really want to learn anything that might damage my opinion of the man.  Complicating matters, you always have to wonder how much of what you are seeing is accurate and how much is the product of embellishment added to make the story more compelling.  Obviously, I already knew Johnny Cash was no angel in his younger days, but I think Walk the Line does succeed in presenting some of his mistakes and problems in a respectful, realistic way.<br /><br />As good as the movie is, it does have some weaknesses.  Naturally, it can't cover Johnny's whole life in detail (nor does it try to), but some aspects of the story could have used more depth and character exploration.  I remember hearing that some relatives of Johnny's first wife weren't all that thrilled with her characterization in the film.  Frankly, I found it hard to judge her at all because we never really learn much about her.  One minute, we see Johnny calling her from overseas, then the next they're married, and then Johnny finally hits it big and goes out on the road.  His wife comes across as a rather shrewish sort, and that's unfortunate because she should be a more sympathetic character in this context.  As far as Johnny and June Carter go, I would like to have seen their relationship ironed out a little bit more, as well.  From the things we see Johnny do in this film, it's difficult for me to understand why June kept coming back to him - as a singer or as a friend.  Even as their relationship grew into love, I never really saw any kind of special spark in their eyes for one another.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a fairly good job in the title role, but I was never able to look at him and see Johnny Cash the way I could look at Jamie Foxx in Ray and see Ray Charles.  The man in black was one-of-a-kind, especially in terms of his voice, and I think Phoenix just tried too hard at times to become the man behind the music.  He especially over-emphasizes Cash's mannerisms onstage, and that just kept disconnecting me from the film.  Casting Reese Witherspoon as June Carter ended up being the Hollywood coup of the year, as she does turn in a wonderful performance, but somebody was asleep at the wheel when some of the other cast members were selected.  Personally, I think terrible mistakes were made in the casting of actors to play Elvis, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and some other well-known musicians.  Orbison ended up looking like some chess club geek, while Jerry Lee Lewis looked like he should have been hanging wallpaper somewhere, far away from any stage.  It's like they cast some of these parts by pulling random names out of a hat or something.<br /><br />Despite the questionable casting decisions and some obvious gaps in the chronology of the film, Walk the Line does tell a compelling story about a true icon of the twentieth century.  One of the qualities that made Johnny Cash unique was his humanity.  No matter how big he got, he always seemed to be one of us, a regular guy who made mistakes just like we all do.  That's why the Folsom Prison album seems to stand at the very nexus of Cash's career - even hardened criminals felt like Johnny was one of them.  If he could turn his life around after hitting rock bottom, so could any of them - or us.  I think this inspirational message could have been communicated a little more effectively in the movie, but it certainly makes the story worth telling.  Johnny Cash fan or not, Walk the Line is a movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>I have always enjoyed both Johnny and June. But I was not too interested in their lives. And I have to admit that this film was a bit depressing at first. It reminded me too much of Steinbeck. I started to question my purchase when before I could finish the thought, I was sucked into their life and this movie. This adds a new perspective on the classic songs. We see that they were just people and subject to personalities and environments as we all are.<br /><br />You will find these songs going through your head days after viewing this movie. Note at the ending credits the real thing as the real duo sings "Long Legged Guitar Pickin' Man"</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>"Walk The Line" is a powerful portrayal to the human spirit, love, and the struggle of the crazy dream. The movie in a sense is a great bio-music pic... much like "Ray" or "Beyond The Sea". But, this movie will not just make fans of Johnny Cash but will appeal to, all movie-goers . The story focuses mainly on the love affair Cash had with June Carter rather than a 'bunch of facts' that relate to Cash's life.<br /><br />The love affair with Cash is not only interesting but, it is relatable and unbelievable sweet. Reese Witherspoon got a well-deserved Oscar for her performance- she gives perhaps the most honest portrayal ever done on June Carter Cash- a smart, intelligent, family orriented women- (which Reese also is).<br /><br />Phoenix looks the part- but in this movie he actually acts the part too- and deserved an Oscar for his performance. The performance is so authentic it is hard to seperate the man from the legend- and the actor from the man. He is GREAT and gives the PERFORMANCE that Cash himself would be proud of.<br /><br />What is even more amazing is the music-both actors sing their songs and REALLY well- the music fits in well with the period and done in chroniological order that makes sense- unlike most bio-music pics.<br /><br />The movie is definately one of the movies that is "must see" the movie is heartwarming, heart-breaking,and amazingly humorous at times...like when Johnny is a rut financially, loses his car, and is on drugs- he walks for miles to June Carter's house a ritual he calls his "June Carter love walk." Both actors give great performances and enduringly sweet. This is definately a movie I'll watch more than once and one to have in your collection!!! Hit the buy now button- and remember to WALK THE LINE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>I suspect I knew a dozen Johnny Cash songs prior to seeing this movie.  At its conclusion, I wanted to go out and buy the Folsom Prison album.  That probably makes it a successful movie!<br /><br />I did wish I knew how much was fantasy and fact.  Was June Carter really such an angel?  Did Johnny Cash really improve that much between his first and seccond song?  Did Johnny really interact with all these other famous musicians?<br /><br />The acting was first rate.  The singing was passionate.  The tension (or lack of it) between the characters was believable .<br /><br />I guess this movie was rated PG-13 for drug use and mild profanity.  This is a pretty good movie to invite friends over to see (when it comes out on DVD).  Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: James Mangold takes us into the formulaic yet satisfying life of the great Johnny Cash. Like all biopics, we have the protagonist who has had a troubled past and overcomes his inner demons to finally get his life back on track. It's pretty much the same senerio for every musical artist. Joaquin Phoenix gives one helluva performance as Cash, and he does it with his eyes. During the musical scenes when Pheonix is performing, you can't help but just stare into his eyes that give off the emotional state that he is singing in. The film is told as a flashback, and we start in Cash's childhood where he suffers the loss of his brother in a tragic accident. His father screams out loud that the devil took the wrong son, and that fuels the troubled past that haunts Cash as an adult. We've all heard the story before, whether it be Cash's story or any other singer/songwriter's. He gets his big break and makes a record, starts touring, falls in love with the lovely Reese Witherspoon who playes June Carter to perfection, uses drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of his past, conquers his problems, and comes to accept life and starts to live it. While it may seem formulaic, the film itself is a fascinating and emotional watch. It's very much like this year's Cinerella Man, a film that is totally formulaic but still brilliantly executed. Mangold, while he has no visual style, does provide a consistent direction for the film that doesn't lose the focus of the audience. The musical scenes are breathtaking and it's all thanks to the brilliant acting. What is even more impressive is that no V/O work was done. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all their own singing, which always adds to the authenticity. The film is a great experience for movie goers, and you'll probably find yourself with a few Johnny Cash tunes on your ipod afterwards.<br /><br />ACTING: Oscar nods for both Phoenix and Witherspoon are going to happen, the performances were absolutly stunning and just incredibly amazing, did I mention the acting was good? Phoenix won't win the Oscar for this one though, I just don't see the Academy giving it to Foxx for Ray last year and now for another musical biopic. Golden Globe? Definately not out of the question.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A story we've all heard before, but it always feels fresh when it's done well. In this case it was done extremely well, the movie was great.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>From the crop fields of Arkansas, he shot to stardom revolutionizing country music while Elvis Presley was revolutionizing rock 'n' roll, he is the Man in Black, the one and only Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phonenix & Reese Witherspoon as Johnny & June Carter Cash in "Walk the Line" the true story of the country music legend and the woman who was all the music he ever loved. I see Oscar gold on this masterpiece, Phonenix on fire, he shines,hes marvelous and Witherspoon is an adorable,irresistable little thing. A beautiful onscreen couple. I see Oscar nominations for them both. It's electrifying musical experience to the eye,ear,heart & soul. See it, even if your not a Cash or Carter fan. It not's just the music, it's who performed it. Only if Johnny & June lived to see it, but more importantly they lived it. "why you wearing black, you look like your going to a funeral" "maybe I am" "hello, I'm Johnny Cash"</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In 1955, a tough, skinny guitar-slinger who called himself J.R. Cash walked into the soon-to-be-famous Sun Studios in Memphis. It was a moment that would have an indelible effect on American culture. With his driving freight-train chords, steel-eyed intensity and a voice as deep and black as night, Cash sang blistering songs of heartache and survival that were gutsy, full of real life and unlike anything heard before. That day kicked off the electrifying early career of Johnny Cash. This movie is the worthy recap of a time in a man's life that is simply too large for any single movie. The movie is entertaining, reasonably true to the facts of Johnny Cash life and full of music.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>Johnny Cash is practically a household name, and even if you aren't into fifties music you're bound to recognize some of his songs, like Ring of Fire and I Walk the Line. However, there's more to his story and this film does its best to tell it.<br /><br />Johnny's hardscrabble life in a relief community to his service in the Air Force and his failure as a salesman are all looked at. The film pulls no punches when it comes to his eventual drug abuse as he performed on the road and the way the pills he took eventually pulled apart his life. His love affair with fellow performer Carter is also highlighted and in fact is a recurring theme in the DVD.<br /><br />A good film but not my cup of tea. No doubt if you're more into music you'd like this much more.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>I am reviewing this nicely done commercial effort to delve into parts of the lives of the legendary singers Johnny Cash and his (eventual) wife June Carter Cash (of the famous mountain music Carter Family bloodlines. Her mother was the incredible vocalist and guitarist Maybelle Carter) in reverse order. Although I saw the this film for the first time when it was released in theaters (and have viewed it several times on DVD) several years ago I am reviewing now after having just seen the real Johnny Cash and June Carter on one of the segments of Pete Seeger's black and white television programs from the mid-1960s, "Rainbow Quest" where they appeared.  And knocked me, and I think Pete, over with their renditions of Carter Family material and information about that clan.<br /><br />Okay, here is the skinny. If you want to get the glamorous, sexy romance and a fetching June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), the heartache and longing of pain in the butt Johnny Cash and the eventual joining together of two great musical talents story then this is the place to start. But, if you want the reason why this film was made in the first place, the legendary musical talent, warts and all, then watch them go through their paces along with old Pete Seeger. Both are worth the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>This is one of the really great musical DVDs; I list others below but because of Amazon's limitations, I can only list ten.<br /><br />This is NOT a complex biographical DVD.  This DVD captures the essence of love within music.  It is a glorious story of a man who married well but whose wife did not "compute" music, and of the love that grew "on the road" between Johnny Cash and his eventual bride (who got him off drugs and helped him "walk the line").<br /><br />The underlying theme, of going from uncotrolled use of drugs to a straight existence within reality powered by love, is uplifting.<br /><br />If you like both music and romance, this DVD is a "must have."

In this regard, "Walk the Line" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her). Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional. I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent ("Election") but with her role in "Walk the Line" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration. Phoenix was as good as Reese and the chemistry between them was absolutely real.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Even though WALK THE LINE is labeled a biopic about June and Johnny Cash, it's also a solid love story that will stand for years.  Gradually the memories of the couple's musical performances will fade, but the memory of their love transcends simple history.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix shines as Johnny Cash, the romantic and the troubled drug user, and as the man who lost a brother.  Joaquin probably used the loss of his own brother, River, in preparing emtionally for the role, but that had to have been very hard.  Reese Witherspoon makes acting look effortless.<br /><br />The movie carries Johnny Cash from his early years, through the tragic loss of his brother, to his love for music.  I remember listening to his songs when I was a kid, but I didn't know that he toured with and around Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis.  I only knew his country years.<br /><br />The scenes and settings feel right and look right.  The visual storytelling gets choppy and leaves a lot out, but it keeps in all the good stuff as well as keeping the story moving along at a fast clip.<br /><br />Even though everyone knows that Johnny and June will get together, it's still emotional and uplifting when he proposes to her on stage during a live performance.  The chemistry between the actors is great.  This is one of those movies that fans will watch again and again.  And if you haven't seen it, you should take the time to do so.  If you're not drawn in by the legends, see it for the acting quality.  Either way you're going to enjoy the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>I have never been a big fan of Johnny Cash.  I know, I know, that makes me a Philistine.  But his baritone never did much for me, and his hallowed status has always been thrust upon me by his many indignant fans.  Something about the Man in Black makes his most ardent fans want to fight to defend the man and his music.<br /><br />I mention this only to say that I was not really looking forward to "Walk the Line," the biopic that does for Cash what "Ray" did for Ray Charles.  The similarities between these two men and the two movies are striking.  Both feature heroes raised literally dirt-poor, teaching themselves music, making it big, and inflicting damage on themselves and others through colossal substance abuse.  And along the way, they make some of the most beloved music America has produced.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays the grown-up Cash, and he nails it.  Cash, with his deep voice and brawler's physique, may be one of the most difficult of artists to channel, but Phoenix does it well.  Initially, Cash struggles as he tries to form an old-timey gospel trio.  But his life is transformed when a music agent tells him, sing like you've got one song left to sing, and God's going to hear it.  Cash responds to this challenge by belting out "Fulsom Prison Blues," and finding the Johnny Cash sound - "strong as a train and sharp as a razor."  That Phoenix does all his own singing, and does it well, is a plus to his fine acting job.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, a daughter in the Carter family of country music royalty.  On the radio since she was 4, she unwittingly inspires Cash, who listens to her on his old radio as a boy.  As adults, they find themselves on tour, and despite missteps and mis-marriages, an undeniable romance blossoms between these two best friends.  One wonders what she saw in the Man in Black, since he spends several years in a wasteland of drugs and booze . . . and yet while June walks away from time to time, Cash never leaves her heart.  And Witherspoon captures Carter's spunk and devotion, and provides another example of an actress who can really sing.<br /><br />This is powerful stuff, if conventional.  You don't go to "Walk the Line" to see anything original - you go because these are two lives that tell one great story.  And great it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Walk The Line" is supposed to be about the ups and downs of one John R. Cash, but in actuality, it's three stories in one.  The first story is that of Johnny Cash, who grew up in Arkansas a poor farmer's son.  His father was hard on him and even cruel when Johnny's older brother passes in an accident.  As Johnny gets older, he pursues a career in music.  His first big break comes at the hands of none other than Sam Phillips.  You know him for his many acts which include the King, the Killer, and the Man In Black (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, respectively), among others.  Cash begins to become very successful and slowly spins out in a self-inflicted chaos of sex, drugs, and rockabilly.<br /><br />The second story is that of June Carter, the "other" woman in Johnny Cash's life.  They befriend each other innocently enough, but as they spend more time on the road together, both of their marriages fall apart.  Cash's wife, Vivian, becomes very guarding of her children (and rightfully so), and Carter tries hard not only to save the life of Cash, but also to fight off her urges to love him.<br /><br />The third story, and my personal favorite, is that of the music created by Cash and Carter.  Their duets are amazing, and they reverberate throughout this biopic.  My personal favorite is "Jackson," but none of the songs in this flick are to be missed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful biopic to watch.  I'd have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the music takes such a precedence in this movie, that we are only given a brief glimpse into the torrid life of Cash.  If you're not a fan of Cash's music, you may find yourself bored during the long scenes on tour.  I personally enjoyed them, but my wife just couldn't take it.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful.  Joaquin Phoenix is almost eerie in his presentation of Cash.  Reese Witherspoon is a spitfire as June Carter Cash.  She delivers one of the best performances of her career in this flick.  Ginnifer Goodwin plays Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife, with tears almost permanently fixed into her eyes.  Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne play Cash's parents, and do a wonderful job of it.  Sam Phillips and his bunch are also gamely represented here.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flick to fans of Cash or of Country and Rockabilly music in general.  Cash's music is legendary, and so is he, but let us not forget that behind every good man is a good woman (in this case, two good women).  Vivian was there in the beginning, when Johnny was starting on his downward spiral.  June literally saved him from falling into nothingness, and both of these women deserve as much credit for Cash's iconic status as he or anyone else does.<br /><br />An excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed Walk the Line. I had read Johnny Cash's autobiography and been a fan of his music for years and like others wondered if this film would do his remarkable life justice. I think it does. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job of portraying Johnny's highs and lows, and Reese Witherspoon absolutely becomes June Carter Cash. I was really happy with the flow of the movie, it did not dwell a lot on the early years his life as the son of a poor sharecropper, but you could tell that he always felt a guilt about the incident that killed his brother at a young age and that (I don't think) he ever thought he got the 'approval' he wanted from his father. Cash certainly had some demons, I think some scenes were not as gritty as they could have been, especially some of his episodes while on drugs, but producers probably did not want to risk getting an 'R' rating. I think this movie will become a classic in years to come and is a must-see for the Cash fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" is representative of Johnny Cash's life, depicting the rise to stardom and its consequences, as well as brief points about his childhood and, later on, his drug addiction and martial problems. Joaquin Phoenix takes on a tough role as Cash, and does commendable in creating the rebellious man who has high hopes of making it big despite family tragedy and hardships. While the die-hard Cash fans might not be as accepting to call this movie an instant and solid success, I, a new fan of Cash, found the film remarkable and very deserving of the accolades it received in being nominated last year ( I thought this film was far superior to eventual winner "Crash").<br /><br />The most remarkable and entertaining aspect of this movie was the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter), as one reviewer noted. Joaquin Phoenix's ability to make a role like this work, and sing Cash's songs with some success, is what really gives this role much credibility and dignity. Reese Witherspoon's role as June Carter relies on much of what she has had to do before, which is create comedy and be perky. However, Witherspoon successfully makes this role complex and deep, not just one-dimensional, and her ability to portray some of the difficulties that June Carter had in her own life while becoming acquainted with Cash makes this portrayal a success. Phoenix and Carter work well together, and they do an excellent job singing some of the songs by Cash and Carter, as well as performing duets they did together (one of my favorites was "Jackson").<br /><br />The film also covers briefly some of the aspects of Cash's family life, as well as his interest in music. Although this part of the film is perhaps too short (what can you do in only two hours), we understand the heavy guilt that plays a role in Johnny's life for the loss of his brother during his younger years. We also see the riff between him and his father, with Johnny seemingly feeling like the "other" son much of the time, and being unable to please him. Johnny derives interest in gospel music, but, when he is told that that won't sell, he pulls out a song he when inspiration hit, "Folsom City Blues" (Cash will later play in Folsom County Jail after he gets tons of fan mail after writing that song).<br /><br />If there is one negative, it is that perhaps there is too much time spent on Cash's drug addiction. Maybe more of this could have been spent focusing on some of his younger years or the later years.<br /><br />However, overall, this film is entertaining, vibrant, and worth the two hours spent watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>When I was little my father would play Johnny Cash records and I distinctly remember "I Walk The Line".  While watching Joaquin Phoenix perform the song, you'd swear that it was Johnny Cash, himself.<br /><br />Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person.  Phoenix has done an excellent job capturing Cash, the man. Not the legend and not what everyone thought he would be. What made Johnny Cash such an icon was that he was an "everyman" and Phoenix gives his all to not only capture every subtle nuance but also to make him believable as a flawed human being.  Reese Witherspoon's performance, as well, is surprisingly good. There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde, and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.<br /><br />The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing. But the love story between these two, the way that June and her family helped him back from his drug addiction are what gives the film its heart. I would recommend this film to anyone, Johnny Cash fan or not. If you don't like him now, you will when the movie is over</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Walk the line by Director James Mangold (I love all his movies) is a gorgeous tale of the love affair between Johnny Cash and June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are well-suited in their roles here. The film focuses mainly on how John and June met and toured together through the years and the start of their affair while he was still married to his first wife. Also talks about Johnny's addiction to pills and his unhealthy relationship with his father. Witherspoon received an oscar for her role, a much-derserved award for this talented actress. Phoenix is wonderful as well, he sure has Cash's mannerisms down to a T. John and June would eventually get married and spend 35 years in wedded bliss til their deaths took form. Walk the Line has solid writing, terrific acting, and a positive message that anyone know matter rich or poor can overcome old demons and survive. Beautiful love story, buy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Let me start by saying that I have never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash and that my taste in music runs to Classical, so I am not a likely target for this movie.  However, I want to tell you that I liked it very much.  The movie portrays Cash as a very complex freight train of talent and emotion that is on some very loose and greased tracks ready to careen off a precipice at any moment.  The Cash in the movie had a certain kind of strength on stage, but off stage was something more like a black hole of emotional needs.  Of course, some would say that someone who needs all that approbation on stage is likely going to keep need it when the curtain falls and the lights are off.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job of pulling of this man's very unique look and sound and facial expressions.  But it is more than a simple imitation or even "channeling" Cash as so many have said.  You can look at the actor's face and tell what Cash is feeling and trying to put into thoughts and when he fails to find the right thoughts, he erupts in frustration.  Just a superb job of acting and a tribute to Cash.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job in making Cash's first wife sympathetic, understandable, and yet never quite a victim.  We understand why the marriage broke down and why it started badly with different expectations from two very different people.  However, Cash's vast emotional needs and charisma seems to have drawn her in, but the pressures and storms that come with the huge fame Cash gained are not compatible with the kind of domesticity Vivian wanted.<br /><br />The person that Cash finally met, wanted, and needed as June Carter.  She had her own baggage coming from "Country Music Royalty" and a couple of bad marriages.  However, she seems to have had greater intellectual clarity and was probably smarter than Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance that wins our sympathy and helps focus our own attitudes towards the storms in Cash's life at any given moment in the film.<br /><br />Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne add just the right touches as Cash's parents Ray and Carrie Cash.  Patrick has to provide the foundation for Cash's emotional insecurity and Lynne the music for him to cling to for emotional sustenance.<br /><br />This is a much better movie than I expected and I am glad that they left things complex and mixed rather than trying to turn this into a moralizing or cautionary story - though there are moral issues and cautionary lessons to draw aplenty.<br /><br />Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Before seeing Walk the Line, I new very little about Johhny Cash. Before it was released in theaters, I knew almost nothing at all. I had heard some of his songs and was more than familiar with his name, but I had no concept of the impact he had on music and on so many lives.<br /><br />The movie touches briefly on Johnny Cash's childhood, enough to paint the picture of a few events and relationships that would shape his life forever. The film next follows Johnny on tour, at the beginning of his career, as he played shows with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and a young Miss June Carter. They travel from city to city delighting audiences, playing shows, having a good time, and for some of them, maybe even falling in love.<br /><br />Johnny Cash had more talent than he knew what to do with. But he also had skeletons in his closet and without June Carter, his story would have been one of what could have been, rather than what actually was, one of the greatest careers music has produced. June Carter, despite being the object of Johhny's affection for many years prior to their marriage, played a very valuable role in his life. Among so many other things, June Carter was Johnny Cash's guardian angel. She saved him from his own demons and inspired him to continue his greatness.<br /><br />Before I even begin to comment on the acting, I need to mention something important. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own "stunt work," if you will. They sang each song featured in the movie. It is truly an impressive thing they did in lending their singing voices and not just their faces to Johnny Cash and June Carter. I have read that Reese Witherspoon was not a very good match vocally to June Carter, but that should not take away from what she did. Joaquin Phoenix's voice was incredible. I thought he did an amazing job sounding like Mr. Cash.<br /><br />From an acting standpoint I feel that there were two breakthrough performances in Walk the Line. I will start with Reese Witherspoon, whose career has been full of light comedies and naive characters. I have not brought myself to watch many of her earlier movies because they do not appeal to me. I hope that is about to change. Your secret is no longer safe, Reese; we now know that you are an impressive presence on screen. She is not just another pretty face, though she certainly is that. Her performance, which earned her an Academy Award, was full of strength and passion. She did humor, drama, and love and she did each one well.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and I have had many creative differences in the past. Well, I do not know him personally and have never actually met the man, but I refer to the roles he has played. From seeing him as male support during the majority of his career, if you had asked me if I ever thought he could play lead, I would have said no. And I would have been wrong. Joaquin Phoenix played the lead, nay, he owned the lead in Walk the Line. He still showed signs of the actor I have not liked in the past, but managed to still captivate me. Maybe it was his likeness to Johnny Cash's voice as he sang that overshadowed the rest of the performance, but I doubt it. I think he has come a long way. I am sure he has worked very hard to get to where he is now, with one Academy Award nomination under his belt. It has paid off.<br /><br />Walk the Line is a movie with two great performances about two great performers. And I can tell you that you will not be the first to rush out and buy Johnny Cash albums after seeing the movie, or even the soundtrack which features the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.<br /><br />For another movie with great vocal performances by the actors see The Commitments.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Overall, this movie was tastefully done. I heard an interview with daughter Roseanne and can understand why this would be very hard for the children to watch. No one likes seeing the light shined on their parent's moments of 'weakness', and both certainly had their struggles, but I think the characters brought out the love and tenderness of these two very wonderful people. We all have our faults, and the Cash legacy will live on not only through their music, but through their beautiful children as well. I hope everyone who watched the movie also has the opportunity to listen to the interviews of the Cash family memories as told from the heart by their daughters.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

Johnny Cash had a broodier personality than I realized, but it was because he felt incomplete without June Carter.<br /><br />Much like Ray Charles, Cash was also traumatized by the death of a brother.  However, there the similarities end. In "Ray", it was revealed that Ray Charles loved music above all else, including his own family and the many, many women.  For Cash, his heart's desire was for one woman only: June Carter...an obsession that drove him to drug addiction.  I liked this approach to the film versus focusing on Cash's rise to fame.  This flaw makes him seem more human and less iconic.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is hot in this film and did a wonderful job; Reese certainly deserved this Oscar...her best role to date. Forget Vanity Fair.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both wonderful in the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter. This is basically a film about their relatonship viewed through the lense of Cash's career and struggles with family and drug abuse. The film is extraordinarily entertaining from beginning to end and the musical sequences are very well done. Both actors deserve a lot of credit for doing the singing and making the performance sequences realistic. No doubt Witherspoon deserved her Oscar and Phoenix was equally deserving in a tough field.<br /><br />Having seen Capote and this I think it would be a close call but I'd have given the award to Phoenix.<br /><br />Overall this is an uplifting story about a love between two people who were obvious soulmates and survived in an environment that makes long term marriages a challenge at best. Very enjoyable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I must say that while I am not a Country Western music fan, I do love biopics if it's well made. The main appeal of Walk the Line for me is to see the performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon whom I have followed since Legally Blonde. I am not even familiar with any of Johnny Cash's music, and yet I was so dazzled by the singing of his songs done by Phoenix, especially that "Ring of Fire" song near the end. To my surprise, I was very taken by Phoenix' mesmerizing performance that actually moved me to tears during the time when his character was down and out and recovering from drug addiction. The love and marriage proposal scene was also very touching.<br /><br />This film chronicles the early struggle and triumphs of Cash's life and career as a rebellious country musician in the '50s and '60s. He had three children with his first wife Vivian, but they got divorced dued to his wild and irresponsible behaviors. June Carter(Witherspoon) was the love his life, and it took many years before he pursuaded her to marry him. In the late '50s Cash was at the top of his game, but his drug addiction eventually caused the downfall of his career. His father(Robert Patrick in heavy makeup to look older) alienated him because he blamed him for the death of second son. It had casted shadows over Cash's life ever since. June and Johnny were the best musician duo/lovers and they were destined to become lifelong partners, despite the lack of social acceptances since they had been married to other people previously.<br /><br />Both Withspoon and Phoenix did their own singing and were pretty convincing. It was very natural for Withspoon to deliver her lines in an authentic southern accent. Her June Carter rendition stole numerous scenes and it's certainly her most impressive performance to date. Too bad her role is more of a major supporting role, which limits her chances of getting an Oscar nomination in the best actress cateogory. As for Phoenix, he had obviously transcended the emotions from the death of his brother River into several of the scenes in this film which made it even more powerful and real. He may not become the front runner for the Oscar this year, but a nomination is sure thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Covering the career of a legend is never an easy task, but this film more than delivers. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver believable and incredible performances as Johnny and June Carter Cash and completely fooled this reviewer, who was astonished to find that their vocals weren't dubbed.<br /><br />It's a bit disappointing that more of Cash's early life isn't covered, especially his turbulent relationship with his father, but this is, after all more about his romance with June, which survived his battles with drinking and drugs and the turmoil of being a celebrity. Honest and forthright, this is a heartwarming tribute to one of the most enduring love affairs in country music history. Can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a pity that Johnny and June didn't live to see it, but they've earned immortality through their music. Five stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix may have captured the look of Johnny Cash, but little else in this well-meaning but shallow biopic of the country legend.  The movie takes us back to the days before Cash became the Man in Black, subjecting us to an insecure man who struggled with his marriage, love for June Carter and drug addictions, while soaring to the top of the country western charts in the late 50's.  The film is visually very satisfying to watch as Phoenix and Witherspoon subsume themselves into the roles of Cash and Carter.  There are a number of fun cameos such as Jerry Lee Lewis and a young Waylon Jennings played by his son Shooter.  The concert scenes are the most fun, as we get a sense of the road shows that were put on culminating in the immortal concert at Folsom State Prison.<br /><br />A deep sense of anger and resentment underlies Phoenix's performance, but one never really gets a full sense of the motivating reasons.  All the viewer is given are visual references to Cash's boyhood years when he lost his brother in a sawmill accident and of his father who never forgave him for leaving his brother alone.  Cash seemed to carry this with him throughout his early recording years, but the movie leads us to assume that he drew most of his music from vicarious outlets, creating the impression that this was a man that had been to hell and back and lived to tell the story, with him ultimately admitting in front of Folsom inmates that he never experienced what they were experiencing.<br /><br />It seemed that what Cash struggled most with was his newfound celebrity status, the unreciprocated love he felt for June Carter and his embattled marriage.  Unfortunately, we never see the charismatic man that thrilled audiences and fans.  Instead, we see a deeply troubled man unable to cope with his life, and June Carter eventually rescuing him from the hole he dug for himself. This movie may have been faithful to his early years, but it was sorely lacking in the energy that propelled Cash to international stardom.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of the Oscar for Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon), Walk The Line chronicles the life and times of legendary country music star Johnny Cash with an intense, and sometimes dark, intimacy. Following on the heels of the previous year's Oscar Award-winning picture Ray, based on the life of Ray Charles, I entered the theater under the mistaken impression that Walk The Line would be a cookie-cutter attempt to capitalize on the various themes of that picture's commercial success. But although the dramatic personal struggle with drug addiction is prevalent in both films, Walk The Line was more than able to stand on its own as a powerful and impressionable big screen biography. And just like the aforementioned film, you leave Walk The Line with a renewed interest in the music of Johnny Cash and a deep personal attachment to the lives of Cash and his likeable wife, June Carter.<br /><br />Directed by James Mangold, the talent behind such notable films as Kate & Leopold (2001) and Identity (2003), Walk The Line begins in the rough and tumble world of Depression-Era Arkansas where a young Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) tends to the family cotton farm with his parents and older brother. Early on, a family tragedy strains the relationship between Cash and his father, providing a glimpse into the epic moment that would shape his life forever. Soon after, the film jumps to the early 1950s where Cash perfects his guitar talents while stationed overseas in the Air Force. His marriage to high school classmate Vivian Liberto lands the two in Memphis where Johnny supports the family as an appliance salesman while pursuing his musical interests on the side. Here, Cash founds The Tennessee Two with bassist Marshall Grant (Larry Bagby) and guitarist Luther Perkins (Dan John Miller), and the trio plays its way to a music deal with local label Sun Records.<br /><br />As part of a promotional campaign, Cash is put on tour with other "rockabilly" newcomers Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Carl Perkins (Johnny Holiday). But during his tour with the quartet, the life of Johnny Cash takes numerous turns. He meets the affable June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), begins an addiction to amphetamines and alcohol, and watches his marriage to Vivian deteriorate under the strain of his constant absence. All three would come to define the next fifteen years of Cash's life as he struggled to triumph over his personal demons. Despite his all-encompassing drug addiction, Cash nevertheless manages to crank out hits, but his personal life hits rock bottom following bouts with divorce, loneliness, depression, and his continued drug addiction. When Cash reunites with June Carter in a musical collaboration, the magical bond between the two is amplified. But Johnny's addiction threatens to ruin everything they've built together...<br /><br />The most impressive aspect of Walk The Line, aside from the storyline itself, is the performance of Witherspoon and her counterpart Phoenix. Amazingly, both provide their own voiceovers, and for the casual listener, very little difference can be detected between the Hollywood talents and the real life country music legends they impersonate. Much was made of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix in the days leading up to the film's release, but I came away more impressed by Witherspoon. Apparently, so did the Academy because they awarded her their highest honor for the role. What stood out the most was the actress's down-to-earth smile and charismatic mannerisms. She created a character with ample assertiveness, yet one that burst at the seams with an infectious optimism and love for life. As such, the audience can't help but fall in love with June Carter. In addition, Witherspoon displays an amazing singing voice that accurately captures the distinct and unique aspects of June Carter's talent. Overall, Walk The Line is a fine film, and a fitting remembrance to the career and life of country music's greatest icon, Johnny Cash...</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>Upfront declaration:<br />1) I am a fan of Johnny Cash's music as much as I'll ever be a 'fan' of anything.<br />2) I can't stand biopics.<br /><br />So I went to see this flick following the proddings of my offspring and wife, in the company of said wife.<br /><br />I want to say a few things that I think need to be added, because they were mostly missing from other reviews.<br /><br />The not-so-good-things:<br /><br />The beginning was rather 'bitsy'. Flashbacks to 'youth', meant to serve as exposition and also 'explanation' are very difficult to do, I know. I think they could have been done better. Not necessarily longer or shorter but just 'different'. They had a perfunctory air, like something that had to be gotten over and done with, but was done without much heart. The transition from the thump-thump-thump of the intro to Cash's youth was jarring, instead of stimulating or creating expectancy. It took me some time to recover my bearings and get 'with it' again--and I WAS 'with it' right at the beginning. The sense of things not working persisted for a good half hour into the movie.<br /><br />The second thing was the down-grading of the importance of Cash's first family. Did they ever matter to him at all? According to this script and implementation, not really. I wonder of this doing the situation justice. It certainly demeans Cash's character. Was he really that shallow, indifferent, selfish? I don't know. Who does? But the real question is, did the film makers intend that effect and impression? If so, they succeeded. If not, they screwed up badly.<br /><br />Now for the good things, which is much more fun:<br /><br />I don't think June Carter was quite the cute--though troubled and tough--little munchkin that Witherspoon portrays her as. But I think she and Phoenix managed to pull off very convincingly the love story that is at the heart of all of this. For it's not really about the music, nor about Cash's social conscience or whatever. It's just about a guy who grew up in troubled circumstances, and like all of us had to carry around the baggage through his life. He also had a 'calling', which not so many people have; or if they do they hardly ever listen.<br /><br />He did listen though and went to some lengths to follow it; and got sucked into the maelstrom of money and fame and all that jazz. Matters were made worse by the fact that a) his family, wife and parents alike, didn't really understand what a 'calling' is and how it can drive someone to do very odd things indeed, and b) it just so happened that the one woman marked against his name in the great scheme of life and the universe and everything was basically unattainable--and yet right across the room.<br /><br />Turns out, however, that, when all was said and done, the 'calling' and its fulfillment was empty without the one thing that really mattered. Still, it's not fair to say that June's rejection of him led Cash into drugs and near-ruin. He made some bad decisions, and part of her rejection was occasioned by those, and that in turn made him make more bad decisions. But that's just life. Thing is, in the end--and in reality, too, which makes a nice change--they did get together; and when she died, after 35 years together, he followed her less than half a year later. It's a very touching and romantic story, made even more touching because it isn't made up.<br /><br />The music? What about the music? Well, this is where the film just 'worked'; because the music paced it admirably and was put to very good use to convey emotion where the bracketing narrative sometimes failed. In fact I wish there had been more music and less narrative. The scope of the Cash/Carter repertoire is so wide that they could have added several judiciously-chosen songs and put the point across even more succinctly, especially in the duets.<br /><br />Phoenix and Witherspoon on the stage are dynamite. I know they're not really singers, and they're just imitating/representing a couple of people that actually lived--but there were some moments where I thought "wow; they're actually better than the originals". I know that's heresy, but what the heck! And isn't it really the ultimate tribute to Cash and Carter when the actors go out of their way to make it even better? I know they went to music boot-camp and all that, but so what? Everybody can learn things. Few will take what they've learned and make THIS out of it.<br /><br />I noted the down-playing of the religious angle of the Cash persona. That was a good decision, though I suspect it was taken more for Hollyweirdesque reasons--meaning venal motives--than out of a sense of story-telling integrity. In any case, there was just enough to point it out, but then just as quickly look away and focus on more important things. Way I see this--from an essentially atheist perspective--I think a person is better off, generally speaking, 'finding Jesus' than doing drugs. His chances of being a decent human being are definitely greater. If finding religion--next to finding June--is what it took to set Johnny Cash's life in order, that's fine with me.<br /><br />4/5 stars overall because of the occasionally-confused story line<br />5/5 for Phoenix and Witherspoon<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNA.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I truyl enjoyed the acting performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash,though overall he was missing that edge that Reese Witherspoon brought as June Cash.I think Her Performance is what got her awarded the Oscar.the film was well put together.just was missing something which kept it from being very good to great. still the Chemstry between Phoenix&Witherspoon is on point. good to see the film acknowledging many of the Highs&Lows of Johnny Cash's Musica career.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Walk the Line is a very good film, lifted even higher by its two great lead performances.

If you want to hear great music and get some insight into one of the most influential musical artist ever, don't walk, run to see this one now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>I'm no country music fan, but I remember liking Johnny Cash when I saw him on TV when I was a little kid, so I decided to check out this movie.  Overall, I didn't like it as much as Kevin Spacey's movie about Bobby Darin, "Beyond The Sea."  But it was interesting and reminded me of some songs I haven't heard in 30 years, and they were better than I expected, even sung by the actors instead of singers.  The relationship between Cash and June Carter develops in a way that's both realistic and romantic, while his relationship with his father is also realistic but kinda sad.  Both of these relationships are resolved as the movie comes to an uplifting conclusion.  Joaquin Phoenix (Signs) is pretty good as Cash, though to me sometimes his performance seemed a bit over the top, but I'm no acting expert, I'm probably wrong.  However, I thought Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven) was sensational as June Carter and  Robert Patrick's (The X-Files) restrained performance as Cash's father was the sort that should win awards.  In conclusion, I think for fans of Johnny Cash or June Carter or Reese Witherspoon, this is a 5-star movie (10-stars where available!), and for the rest of us just a notch below, still definitely worth seeing, interesting and surprisingly upbeat.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Because it is based on two of his own published memoirs ("Cash: the Autobiography" and "The Man in Black"), "Walk the Line" becomes, in many ways, the "official" movie biography of musician/singer/songwriter Johnny Cash - and it isn't really the movie's fault that it arrives so close on the heels of "Ray," the equally critically acclaimed film about Ray Charles.  The similarities between the two stories are, at times, positively amazing:  the meteoric rise to stardom, the unhappy marriage, the serial philandering, the substance abuse, the arrest for drug possession.  Heck, there's even the death of a beloved brother in a freak childhood accident that comes to haunt both the men for the rest of their lives.  Yet, "Walk the Line, " written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold and directed by Mangold, triumphs over its biopic cliches thanks to solid writing, toe-tapping musical numbers and superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the key roles of Cash and singing superstar - and future wife - June Carter.<br /><br />Phoenix pours his whole heart and soul into his performance both as an actor and as a singer, reproducing Cash's sound and vocal intonations with uncanny accuracy.  Witherspoon captures Carter's sizzle and spunk perfectly, yet brings a real sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the character.  Their romantic scenes together are some of the best in the film and it is as a romance, rather than as a cautionary tale of the perils of show business, that the movie really connects with its audience.<br /><br />We've seen a lot of this stuff before, but all credit to the actors, we don't mind watching it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Joaquin (Leaf) Phoenix (Ladder 49, Clay Pigeons) blazes and exlpodes emotionally and terrifically as the man in black, Johnny Cash, just as Jamie Foxx did last year when he played legendary Ray Charles. Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly  performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself. A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances.

Joaquin Phoenix just didn't line up with Johnny Cash for me. June Carter Cash was a handsome women but not like Reese Witherspoon who is<br />extremely attractive (cute). That said both actors did remarkably excellent jobs singing. Cry Cry Cry was very effective. Two others Cocaine Blues & Get Rhythm are not heard very often. A lot of the movie was wasted on John's sophmoric pursuit of June. Sometimes he was married or she was married to someone else. It didn't matter to him. He begs her to marry him. It was childish & pathetic as portrayed. A very short movie without that nonsense. Of course the best parts were the stage performances of both of them. So, it's okay & I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>Honestly, I was incredulous when Ray was getting all the attention it was getting.<br /><br />I was incredulous when Walk the Line was getting all the attention it was getting.<br /><br />And what do you know but that is but an arbitrary and minor parallel that ties these two brilliant works of art together.<br /><br />While some people might complain about a formula developing, such a complaint is slightly unfair.  Sure, the focus of the two movies are similar enough that the exposition of the storyline sometimes seems a bit familiar, something that in a time where originality is upheld as one of the highest virtues, might lead people in the wrong direction about regarding works such as these critically.<br /><br />So they both involve a death of a brother at a young age.  Uh, those deaths?  They actually happened.  So they both involve drug addiction.  Uh, that actually happened.  So they both involve adultery and special love interest.  Well, that actually happened.  And you say it's a shame how both deal so much with post-traumatic stress disorder?  Well... with the things they've gone through.<br /><br />But focusing on Walk the Line alone now, let us contemplate on what this movie so GOOD.<br /><br />For one thing, the acting comes readily to mind.  Acting is one of the most readily apparent and focused on parts of filmmaking for the reason that it's basically what makes or breaks the story.  The acting in this film?  Brilliant, and I'm not just saying that.  Joaquin phoenix's role isn't just unbelievable... it's really believable.  Reese Witherspoon pulls of June Carter and honestly it's difficult to imagine an actress like her actually pulling the strings like that.  Okay, so I'm biased because she's been in mainstream movies of little importance.  But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.<br /><br />And then they can both sing, which I find hilarious considering most vocalists of modern bands can't even seem to sing yet two actors can and can also sing exactly like the people they're portraying.  Ahhh, the state of modern music... but I digress.<br /><br />Secondly, the writing.  As discussed above, the story follows the same rough outline as Ray, but it is different in this way: Johnny Cash is a different character than Ray Charles.  Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented.  It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.<br /><br />Oh, and the music.  I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff.  It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.<br /><br />Then of course there's the directing and the cinematography.  Specifically, if anyone's doubting the impactfulness of the work behind the camera, I argue to rewatch that long shot where Cash tears apart the bathroom.  Watch how everything possible seems to be at full work here, movement, zoom, acting, makeup, set design, music, atmosphere, lighting, all targeted in such a way that it does not feel reasonable to assume that such a take could ever be done again, even if all the same mechanics were at work.<br /><br />Okay, so I've basically just hyped it up a whole lot more, adding to that same hype that has people tired and sick of the whole idea of the movie before they've seen it.  Admit it, the mere fact that it's been nominated for some Oscars means that it already feels overrated.  I know exactly what you mean...<br /><br />...afterall, what made me wait to see it so long?<br /><br />But whatever.  Think what you want.  I think this film is pretty darned great.  I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>There is a moment in the new Johnny Cash Biopic WALK THE LINE that is so true and honest it stuck with me throughout the whole film. It's a moment that most people will forget, others will scoff and probably say "look at that close-minded Bible-Thumper." But I'll carry that moment with me for a long time. Judith Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is walking around a small five and dime. A former Southern Gospel Child star she has just gone through a horrible divorce. An old sweet women walks up to her and compliments her parents as being great Christians. After Carter thanks her for the sentiment. The old women spews the line "Divorce is an abomination" thus killing Judith with her down-home Christian Charm and in the process putting good ole James 3:9 into practical application "With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.(James 3:9 NIV)<br /><br />Working in Christian Radio I have come into contact with people like this. Hey I was once even accosted by a man in a collar because he didn't like the direction the station was going (and I didn't even make the decisions about that anyway.) But I also remember how easy it is to judge someone for their mistakes. It also allows me to have great admiration for June Carter and her family cause frankly this film allows them to show so much Christian love I'm embarrassed.<br /><br />.....But before this review turns into a sermon allow me to tell you just what I think I of James Mangold's WALK THE LINE.<br /><br />There are some people that are so complex, so multi-dimensional, that to try to sum their lives up in a few hours would be impossible. Johnny Cash is that kind of person. He was a man of faith, a man of sorrow, a man fighting his demons, and a man who had a gentle simplicity. When you saw him you thought he was easily figured out. WALK THE LINE tries and sometimes succeeds. Joaquin Phoenix stars as the Man In Black, and does a good job of becoming Cash. I didn't find myself looking at him and saying here's a guy trying to be someone he's not (earlier this week I sat through CAPOTE, and thought "wow that's a great Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing Truman Capote, {in all honesty I was so bored by Capote I fell asleep in the middle of it so that's why there is no review}). It's a good performance because Pheonix tries his hardest to keep Cash grounded. Reese Witherspoon also controls June Carter-Cash with a live vivaciousness. She fills those shoes so well she almost steals the movie away from Pheonix and that's quite okay with me.<br /><br />What doesn't work is a screenplay by Gill Dennis and Director James Mangold that is so difficult to nail down. It jumps from scene to scene because that's what it feels it needs to do. So while the performances are great, the film is too busy trying to play out events, instead of getting to the heart of the matter: WHO WAS JOHNNY CASH?. It gives us scenes with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and The Man in Black's troubles with drugs, but sometimes forgets that this is a film about a man. It's too pre-occupied with being a bio-pic and not about getting to the heart of the matter: WHO IS JOHNNY CASH? Why must bio-pics be so conservative? Why must we sit through another film about another celebrity that is too busy telling a story to care about the lead characters? (This was the problem with RAY last year. Again a film with great performances, but too preoccupied with getting the viewer from one momentous career moment to the other and not nailing done who RAY CHARLES, really was.) Johnny and June Cater Cash are people with lives far more interesting than this movie.<br /><br />But then there is the music. T Bone Burnett has done it again. He captured the sound of the times. He nails down Cash's music quite nicely. If there is man out there batting a thousand producing soundtracks it's Burnett. From his work on the groundbreaking "O Brother Where Art Thou" to "Cold Mountian" he makes the music a character in the film. Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task. I just wonder why he chose to use Phoenix and Witherspoon's voice and not the CASH recordings themselves.<br /><br />I also liked director Mangold's attention to detail. He has captured a changing America not with the turbulent events but with background details. This is a film about Cash, and I'm glad that he captured it that way. Many films take try to hard to pull us into the time period by saying "alright here's the sixties cut to a group of hippies protesting Vietnam." WALK THE LINE grounds itself by not making statements about society but by showing us Cash.<br /><br />Then the film eventually ends with a pointless happily ever after moment that steals something from the films final analysis. It feels forced, and leaves us at a place that is too nice and peaceful. It felt like I was watching the end of Leave it to Beaver. Sheer badly paced schmaltz. I wished with film could have ended somewhere else. WALK THE LINE is a fine bio-pic, it has some brilliant acting. But it could have been so much better, CASH was larger than life and WALK THE LINE is too busy immortalizing Cash to let us know him. It's funny that, the small moment with June Cater and the old women struck me so much. It was the moment that felt honest? Who was Johnny Cash? WALK THE LINE doesn't really tell us.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>you're sadly mistaken and duped. Oh, why don't I like this film, it's  because what happens is a train wreck and without the energy and emotion to make it palpable.  I respect both of the actors and the director as well as Cash and his wife, but this film makes the worst compromises. It sacrifices genuine moments of joy in his life for muted paraphrases of them. Film is an emotional medium in terms of storytelling and you can't tell a biopic with it. Often biopics are inaccurate because of this and it seems this one has the reverse problem, they made a dull movie because they didn't want to be accused of sensationalism. That "d word" in the last sentence sums up this movie just fine. It's dull from start to finish, it never takes off and it finishes in a way that makes even the biggest supporter of it think "that's it"  or even possibly "well, it had to end sometime" or even ludicrously, "I thought they were going to cover the later years when he did that cover of "hurt"." I can't think of one reason for this movie even existing except for the fact they were cashing in on the bandwagon of people who became fans when the media made a deserved tribute to him when he died. It's possibly and even likely that Cash's life is worthy of dramatization, but what's shown here isn't worth the trouble.  It's not terrible because of the performances, but the performances feel like composites instead of authentic portrayals. I hated that and also hated the fact that I knew there were better actors for these roles as well as better stories to tell. They just seem depressed and without energy throughout. Just to state the obvious: this film is a downer even if the ending is somewhat victorious.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I didn't know much about the life of Johnny Cash prior to seeing this movie.  I wasn't even particularly a fan.  I must admit that I enjoyed this film, though.  The most impressive factor to me (as a recording engineer and producer) was Joaquin Phoenix's ability to emulate the vocal characteristics of Johnny Cash.  He came just about as close as an actor could be expected to come.  Reese Witherspoon also does a very respectable job of carrying a tune in this movie.<br /><br />The life being chronicled in this movie is certainly an interesting one, yet it is certainly not a story we haven't seen before.  It bears countless similarities to other "rock star" movies we've all seen in the past.  They come from humble beginnings, take a chance and make it big, crumble under the pressure of the fame, turn to drugs and become dependant - and eventually get cleaned up by the few people who give a damn.  Sometimes this kind of story doesn't have a happy ending.  Luckliy for Johnny Cash and all of his fans, this one did.<br /><br />The movie is engaging.  Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderful together.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I won't say much, except that this was a truly wonderful feature film.  Congratulations to Reese Witherspoon for her Oscar.<br /><br />MC White said:  Great film!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Johny Cash is before my time but that doesn't matter. Anyone could watch this movie without knowing anything about him and just fall in love with the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just awesome here as Johny Cash and even puts his oscar nominated performance in Gladiator to shame. I don't know what kind of expressions the real  Johny Cash made but Phoenix literly becomes someone else here almost as if he's possessed.<br /><br />  Cash has a wife and a family and his dream job is to be a singer and after that happens his money is there to support his family but he isn't. Then he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and that complicates his marriage even more since he falls for June instantly. He gets June to to  sing with him which makes his wife jealous, especially when he starts hanging June's pictures all over the walls. On top of that he becomes a pill popper that washes down the pills with beer. Which gets in the way of his marriage, his dream job and keeping his friendship with his dream girl. All that might sound depressing but you'll feel uplifted and happy by the end.<br /><br />  Reese Witherspoon is excellent here and I hear critics say that Philip Seymour Hoffman should win for Capote and that Reese should win best actress. I agree, she should win best actres but how could anyone say she should win and that Joaquin Phoenix shouldn't ? If you listen to the real Johny Cash and the real June Carter sing in the end credits, Phoenix sounds exactly like Johny Cash. While Witherspoon just sorta sounds like June Carter but barely. I'm not knocking her performance, she has a lovely voice and great chemestry with Phoenix period. I just don't see how you could watch this movie and walk away saying that any other actor deserves the award more than Phoenix . I'd love to see them both walk away with oscars. It's their best work in their entire careers. If you don't believe me, just watch this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie.  Was it going to be singing or was it going to be Johnny's life story?  It was more than either of those.  You get sucked into Johnny's life.  They set up his story on how he ended up on his road to music but the story really takes off once he makes his record and goes on tour.  It shows his highlights and his low times.  It doesn't hold back it doesn't try and show Johnny in a one deminsional light it shows him as human.  I came out of the movie theater having a new found respect for June and Johnny.  Not because they made it big but because they were human and had their tough times, but lived on to make it one hell of a story.  My advise if you catch a movie this winter.  This is one to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" as James Mangold directs it is not the movie I would have made.  I would have begun at Folsom Prison, and would have carried the movie from there deep into the 1970s, through and beyond Cash's network TV show.  Much of what the rest of the movie covered -- the years between Cash's first record in 1955, and his marriage to June Carter in 1968 -- I would have condensed and inserted as flashbacks during the post-Folsom action.<br /><br />Then again, that's why they didn't come to me to make the movie.<br /><br />This film had to introduce Johnny Cash to a 2500-screen audience that hadn't heard all that many records, or read either of his autobiographies.  Thus, the long simmering love story between Carter and Cash takes center stage, with all of the usual beats of a celebrity biopic: the meet cute, the stormy courtship, the offbeat marriage proposal.  All of this material is competently handled and exactly what you would expect.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix has been rightly praised for his performance.  He reportedly spent hundreds of hours learning the guitar and mastering That Voice, and every second of that preparation shows.  No celebrity biopic is going to stand if the actor is not up to par, and I cannot envision someone doing a better job than Phoenix of portraying Johnny Cash from ages 18 through 36.<br /><br />The real relevation for me, though, was Reese Witherspoon.  The movie takes it first real breath of air when she collides into Phoenix backstage at an early Cash concert in Texas.  Her singing voice is also marvelous.  Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the Carter/Cash duet "Jackson" twice in the movie, and nail it both times.<br /><br />At those moments when Phoneix and Witherspoon are onstage together, and demonstrating their remarkable craft, this movie transcends the typical off-the-rack movie biography, and becomes something truly magical.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>What is most intriguing about the new Johnny Cash biopic is how Joaquin Phoenix does more of an impressionistic take on the Man in Black rather than the dead-on impersonation that Jaime Foxx did as Ray Charles, or going further back, that Gary Busey did as Buddy Holly. Although Phoenix lacks Cash's craggy features and full-throated delivery, there is enough resemblance vocally and physically for him to get away with it. Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film. When he performs onstage, it is not so much the musicality that gets you but the often scary glare he gives as a tortured soul. Whether destroying a dressing room or feeling ill-at-ease with his stoic parents, it's a powerfully unrelenting performance that evokes Cash's spirit, albeit one that is sometimes too off-putting and humorless over the course of a 136-minute film.<br /><br />Recent biopics seem to be following similar dramatic patterns. Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to "Ray" in treatment - a rural childhood, a demanding parent, a transformative childhood trauma, adultery, drug addiction. However, to Mangold's and co-writer Gill Dennis's credit, he does not go back and forth to Cash's childhood to make us understand his pain. Instead, he deals with it succinctly upfront and uses the periodic reappearance of his parents as the emotional link. The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core. Cash's incessant, decade-long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real-life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern-fried sensibility. What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in "Vanity Fair" or her overachieving half-spirit in "Just Like Heaven",  are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks. She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially "Jackson", are among the movie's best moments. Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing. As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no-nonsense nurturing that attracts our attention more than Phoenix's doleful responses.<br /><br />It's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real-life performers or the actors portraying them. Some voices are so recognizable as to defy impersonation (e.g., using Ray Charles' original tracks in "Ray"). Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter.  Credit needs to go to T. Bone Burnett for training them so well for six months. There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.<br /><br />The movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm-singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small-minded shrew. Like all-fact-based movies, the movie can also feel episodic, and it does sag somewhat in the middle as the film belabors Cash's amphetamine addiction. Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood filmmaking with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix takes on the early life and times of Johnny Cash, with something more than an assist from Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It's great material, more factual than many dramaticized biopics, but seems like it's always standing just a hair away from fully embracing the man and his mythos. Phoenix emphatically pours himself into the role, but can't quite nail the man's authoritative, larger-than-life presence either on the stage or off it. That, along with his ever-so-slightly imperfect take on Cash's legendary singing voice, had me seeing the Oscar nominee as a tremendous impersonator but not a living, breathing character unto himself. Surprisingly, Witherspoon fares much better in a role that seemed on the surface to be terribly miscast. She's sweet, streetsmart and talented, and much of the trauma we endure from Cash's self-inflicted trouble is drawn from the toll it takes on her. An ambitious picture that has its heart in the right place, but can't fully recover from a few crucial, disappointing near-misses.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>I found "Walk the Line" in the bargain bins at a nearby Wal-Mart. I snatched it up in an instant. "Walk the Line" was an acclaimed movie, the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I particularly remembered Johnny Cash from his rise in the earliest days of what later became Rock 'n' Roll. He, along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and several others were the star recording artists on the legendary Sun Records roster under the direction of Sam Phillips. This DVD will automatically become an important part of my music collection.<br /><br />It's an excellent movie! I can't emphasize this enough. Joaquin Phoenix and  Reese Witherspoon were outstanding in their depictions of Johnny and June, and they did their own singing! The music was quite good, perhaps not quite up to the original masters, but it was close. All of the other musical performers were outstanding. The movie was a period piece, of course, and the depiction of the 50s and 60s was very well done. I particularly liked the 50s. Everything looked absolutely authentic. The streets were lined with magnificently restored 50s and earlier cars, some of which I haven't seen for decades. Where did they get them all?<br /><br />The story was captivating. It recorded Johnny Cash's spectacular rise from being a failing door-to-door salesman, to a recording artist and up to a super-star in a very short period of time. Naturally, there's booze, drugs and women, not necessarily in that order, and there's the fall. It's a common story for rock 'n' rollers, but it's exceptionally well done here. And the story really got a good grip on the heart. This movie was magnificently entertaining, and if you liked the music, it's just heavenly. Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I am not a country song fan. But I do like the song Walk The Line. I heard it on a Lifetime movie called Baster out of Carolina. I didn't know who song Walk The Line till this movie came out. After hearing about this movie I was excited to see it.

This is a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon star in this 2005 drama.<br />Biographical story of Johnny Cash becoming a country singer<br />and meeting country singer love, June Carter. Joaquin and<br />Reese are great together, but I wish Joaquin got an oscar<br />too. This special edition has nice picture and sound plus<br />neat extras. I recommend this great drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Watching this movie when I came out,it couldn't help but remind me, in a number of respects. to "Ray," a film out a year earlier. Both were biographies of singers of a similar era, the main difference between the color of their skin, Ray being Ray Charles, of course, and this movie about Johnny Cash.<br /><br />Both singers (and films):<br /><br />1 - had a brother who died early on in their lives which affected them for years and years; 2 - were made to feel guilty about those deaths even though there was no reason for that guilt; 3 - had adulterous affairs as their singing careers began to take off; 4 - became addicted to drugs and beat that addiction; 5 - made bold decisions regarding their careers that went against prevailing thought but turned out to be the right decisions; 6 - movies featured outstanding music and slick photography; 7 - movies were fast-moving and interesting to view all the way through despite being over two hours long; 8 - featured wonderful acting performances.<br /><br />In Walk The Line, Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Cash, goes one up on Jamie Foxx, who played Charles, because Phoenix did his own singing....and he was very good. The same applies to Reese Witherspoon as "June Carter." Her singing talent surprised me. It makes the film all the more believable when you know the actors are actually singing.<br /><br />I am not familiar with Ginnifer Goodwin, who played Cash's first wife, but I think she gets unfairly ignored in the publicity of this film. Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Robert Patrick as Cash's father. Wasn't this the same young, trim villain in Terminator 2, which wasn't out that long ago? How can this be the same guy?!!<br /><br />I think this was the better of the two films, not just because of the realism but Charles seemed almost cold, no love in him, no commitment to any woman or his own kids, while Cash has a lot of more heart to him, even if it was misplaced at times.<br /><br />That seems to be the major theme of the WTL movie: the romance between Cash and Carter. Unfortunately, that's my only complaint about this film. This movie glamorizes this affair between Cash and Carter just a little too much, manipulating the audience to the point where we all want this couple to live happily ever after forgetting that Cash was married to another nice woman with two kids. Yeah, some of the ugly parts of adultery are shown but not to the degree the sweetness of this illicit romance is portrayed. The movie does not send a strong enough message that the right thing to do is for Cash to be a good father and husband in the first place and for Carter to stay away from him - period. The worst scene in the film might be Cash's two kids crying their eyes out watching their parents fight. Adultery always kills the kids more than anyone, which is one big reason I was sorry to see the Cash & Carter affair so romanticized.<br /><br />I'd have liked to have seen Cash's prison ministry detailed a little more since he was so faithful in that area, and his Christian testimony in general, which was very strong his last few decades, but the film didn't deal with those last three decades. Too bad, but understandable since there is just so much you can show in two hours. The filmmakers took the tried-and-true road of a romance story instead, which makes sense business-wise.<br /><br />With all the goods and bads, the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music, acting, visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people, almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life. He was an amazing man and a four-hour film about "the rest of the story" would have been fine with me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Walk The Line is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. We get outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Look also for a strong showing by Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian. Waylon Payne also acts well as Jerry Lee Lewis. The plot moves along nicely even though there is little time spent on Johnny's childhood and his stint in the military; and the cinematography is well done.<br /><br />When the film begins, we get a brief glimpse into the main themes that ran through Johnny's life when he was a very young boy growing up in the South. His father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was rather cold toward him and became even colder still when Johnny's younger brother Jack (Lucas Till) died after an accident with a chainsaw. After what seems to have been a brief period of time in the military, Johnny marries his sweetheart Vivian and tries to make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. However, Johnny's efforts in sales just didn't work out--but when he and a couple of his buddies get a chance to record a record for Sun Records things finally begin to look bright for Johnny and his young family.<br /><br />Of course, complications ensue. Johnny spends time on the road--in fact, he spends a lot of time on the road and after he meets June Carter on the road his marriage to Vivian slowly but surely begins to crumble. Vivian tries hard to get Johnny to stay at home more and focus on his children; but Johnny never seems quite able to do that and after quite a few years they divorce.<br /><br />Johnny pursues June Carter even though she marries another man; and he never quite gets over his poor relationship with his father. After time, Johnny's addiction to amphetamines also takes a toll on his career.<br /><br />Will Johnny be able to finally convince June Carter to marry him? How does his relationship with Columbia Records go while he has all his personal problems? Just in case you're not familiar with the story of Johnny Cash, I'll leave these questions and more for you to find out as you watch this excellent flick.<br /><br />I certainly think the storyline should have continued after 1968; Johnny lived and did much more with his life and career between the years 1968 and 2003 when he passed away. However, the story is quite strong and the ending titles do give you a pretty good idea of what happened to Johnny and June Carter in general.<br /><br />The DVD comes with quite a few deleted scenes and there is an optional running commentary with co-writer and director James Mangold. Great!<br /><br />Johnny Cash fans will love this biopic which is rather good despite a minor flaw here and there. I was very impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon performed all of their songs without any dubbing! Johnny Cash was a good human being and an exceptionally talented man who deserves to have his life portrayed in a biopic. People who like biopics will also enjoy this film. It's a keeper!</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>To be honest, I hadn't seen this movie until the other night.  I'm not a fan of country music and therefore I always thought that this wouldn't interest me, yet it was on TV the other night and I got engrossed in it from start to finish.  It was a moving story and so well acted.<br />Joaquin and Reese had amazing chemistry in every scene, but the best was watching them on stage together.  I thought they did such a good job singing rather than lip syncing.  Joaquin had his vocals down perfectly and you almost couldn't tell that it wasn't in fact Johnny Cash himself singing.  I never knew how difficult his childhood was and the lack of love from his father toward him.<br />You do not have to be a fan of Cash's music to really apreciate this.  Walk The Line is a great movie that I highly recommend.  It's so interesting and you can't help but tap your feet to the music.  It's so well acted and a great love story.  Go see it now if you haven't already.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Someday someone needs to shoot the definitive biopic of Johnny Cash, one of the American music scene's most storied and talented figures, because Walk the Line isn't anything like that. Yes, it's not supposed to be about Johnny Cash as much as it is about his stormy early relationship with his soul mate June Carter, but even insofar as it is that, Walk the Line is not even a very strong love story. Good performances are here, though, from several actors, but I was disappointed in Walk the Line, mostly because this film wasn't what it could have been or should have been or what I wanted it to be. I know it wasn't my production and others, including Johnny Cash, who gave his approval to the project before his passing, made this the story they wanted to tell, but speaking personally, I think this was both a needless assault on a cherished myth and a bit of a tall tale in itself that sacrificed fact for drama and re-wrote entire timelines. I know we live in the golden age of bringing down heroes and showing that the famous are as fallible as the rest of us, but why on earth concentrate on the aspects of the Cash's relationship that were so overly emphasized in Walk the Line? And then why re-imagine them when the truth made a better story in itself? Johnny Cash was a legend and deserves his own tribute in film. Maybe someday.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>That voice. Is there a more distinct voice this side of Graceland? Cash is in many ways an obscure or remote figure, hard to embrace and difficult to be "crazy about" in quite the same way as one falls for the King, but what a gift. This film is a deserved tribute surely. The casting is marvelous; one can't really imagine a better group of actors being assembled. Phoenix and Witherspoon are a delightful couple. She sparkles like a star, even when he, like a stone, drops into one of his moods. The forbidding Robert Patrick plays the father as a dark force, harsh and judgmental like a Baptist minister. I loved it when June's parents waved their shotguns at the drug dealer trying to bring a stash to Johnny. Those were simple folk and simpler times. Again and again, we see pictures of the 50s and 60s in film and wonder what happened to this great country.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>As with the movie Ray, I would think that it would be difficult to make a dull film about such a larger than life figure as Johnny Cash. Beginning with the trauma-inducing death of his brother Jack in rural Arkansas, his overbearing father who blamed him for his brother's death, a tour in Germany with the Air Force where he wrote his first song, and his self-destructive addictions, the film takes us to Cash's eventual marriage proposal to June Carter on stage in Canada. Carter and her parents, for all practical purposes, saved Cash's life and career. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon (who won an Oscar for best actress for her performance) sing Cash's songs; no voice-over lip syncs here. My only disappointment with this film, like the film Ray, is that it ends while Cash is still a young man. He only got better with age. Others have complained that the film makes almost no mention of Cash's rather outspoken Christian faith. But these are minor quibbles about a good film about a great man and musician.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>The most striking thing about this movie, and something that has been widely mentioned with good reason, are the spectacular performances of the movie's lead characters, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Their acting is tremendous, but as Johnny Cash and June Carter they do their own singing as well, and pull it off remarkably well.  I believe Cash's voice to be inimitable, but Phoenix makes a very good attempt.<br /><br />Most of the movie's entertainment value comes from the music--the singing throughout is certainly the highlight.  The movie dragged a bit for me at times, but for the most part flowed fairly well, and some of the most interesting events in Cash's life (his introduction to Folsom while in the Air Force, touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and others, etc) are chronicled well.  Johnny's pill-popping addiction seemed a bit drawn out to me, however.  Despite this fact, however, this was a very entertaining movie and certainly worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix does a breath taking job at portraying Johnny Cash.  The mannerisms, the facial expression, the way he held his guitar and hunched his head over, while grinning--perfect.  Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June Carter, and the two of them together constantly steal the show from each other.  It must also be said that both of these actors use their own voices for the songs, and that's saying a lot because the music in this movie is amazing.<br /><br />The story, the music, the progression of the events is very well done.  One, upon watching the movie, is totally immersed in Mr. Cash's world.  They feel what he feels, see what he sees.  This two hour movie takes us through the past, on an amazing trip in Johnny Cash's shoes as he walks the line.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" is a film that covers the early career of Johnny Cash and his early romances, plus his encounters with rock n' rollers such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley while on tour. My Mum saw it at least 3 times in the cinema, and then went a whole bunch of Johnny's albums afterwards. When it came out on DVD, I had to pick it up, see what all the fuss was about. It's really well done, I thought, in pretty much every way.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny, and Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, but after a while I forgot it was them. They did a really good job, I reckon. They really looked the part, they really spoke the part, and really sung it. You could feel the humour, the struggles and the yearning in their lives. Can't say the same about the guy who played Elvis, which is the only thing that bugged me about the film. I mean, he did an all right job, but considering there are so, so many Elvis impersonators in the world, you'd think they'd get someone who looked and sounded a little truer. Ah well. Not really a big deal.<br /><br />The direction is really great, I thought. I like the way some of the shots helped you guess just what Johnny was thinking just as you needed to in the plot, if that makes sense. The filmmakers definitely have a love of the music and for the man. You can see there's a lot of care taken making the sets, reproducing the instruments and the colour of the 1950s and 1960s. There are a few things to think about besides the music too (father/son relationships, the nature of compassion, etc), but nothing feels forced, it seems to come naturally out of the story. It all feels very natural, actually, that sums up the style very well. Realistic, yet warm.<br /><br />There's only a couple of special features on the one disc edition, but it's enough for me. There's a commentary by director James Mangold, who describes why he wanted to make the film, what he was trying to evoke, and even reads some parts from the screenplay while its particular scene is playing. There's also ten deleted scenes, also with a commentary by Mangold, and the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Definitely worth a look for music fans, lovers of Johnny Cash and biopic watchers. It's a fine "line"!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>Is it just me, or has biography movies about singers have gotten pretty popular in the last couple of years? First we had Ray, then Beyond the Sea, and now we have Walk the Line, and I am only counting the movies that I can think of, that has come out starting in 2004, even through I do know there has been a lot more movies like this. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they both do thier own singing in this movie, rather in some other movies where they either get somebody to come in and to the singing, with the actor lip synching, or even lip synching to the singer's records such in Ray. And who knows what other movies that we see of musical bio picks, and who will play the role, and will they do thier own singing, or lip synching, either to recordings, or whoemver they get to do the singing voice. The movie begins in 1968, when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is about to do a live concert in a prison. The name of the prison is Folsom Prison, and then we flash back 24 years earlier, when we meet 12 years old (Ridge Canipe) and his older brother Jack (Lucas Till), who live a life on a farm. Jack spends his time with the bible, Johnny listening to singers including June Carter on the radio, thier father ((Robert Patrick) drinks, and thier mother (Shelby Lynne) retreats into gospel standards from the Heavenly Highway Hymnal. But then saddness hits the family, when Jack is killed in a circular-saw accident. And there father says that god took the wrong boy. And then we flash to 1955, when Johnny Cash is married to his high school sweetheart Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin). Johnny Cahs so goes by Sun Studios where he sees aritists pefroming, and decides to become a singer, and even tries out for Sam Philips (Dallas Roberts), and  hits the road, where seen in cameos are Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings), and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne). And then soon he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and then he falls in love with her, and tries to win her over. And like I said before Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon does all thier own singing, and not only that, Joaquin also learned how to play guitar for this movie, if you love bio pics, or anybody in the movie, or a big Johnny or June Carter Cash fans, then this is a must for you to add to your list.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This is an amazing movie. If you aren't a fan of Johnny Cash, you will be after you watch this movie. The acting, the story, and definitely the music work very well and make this movie incredible. You hear about his life, but it is a different thing when you watch it. Once again, the actors were fantastic and everyone fit their role perfectly. R.Patrick was great as John's dad, he isn't given enough credit, but he did a great job in his role. Overall, great...get this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>These days it is difficult to know what you are going to get when you watch a movie from Hollywood.  Is the movie going to be a classic, or a pale copy of a pale copy?  There are no worries about this movie; it is a wonderful overview of Johnny Cash's life that hits the highlights and the feeling of his career without bogging down in excessive details.<br /><br />The movie fast forwards through Johnny Cash's early years, stopping briefly at incidents that had a profound effect on Cash in his adult life.  While little attention is given to details, a viewer quickly gets the sense of how Cash's life was affected by poverty, his brother's tragic accident, and his years in the Air Force.<br /><br />The movie really begins to take off in 1955.  Johnny tries to be several things that he clearly was not.  A chance encounter with a recording studio soon had Johnny launched on the perpetual touring circuit that was required in that era to popularize music.  Unfortunately, the constant touring was a strain on Cash and the temptations of touring, particularly alcohol, drugs and beautiful women, caused Cash's marriage and career to suffer.<br /><br />Moving in and out of Cash's life was June Carter.  June was the opposite of Cash - stable and level-headed.  Fortunate for Cash, who realized early in his career that he loved June Carter, June was always there when he needed her.  This movie ends with an overview of the latter part of Cash's career and marriage to June Carter Cash, again providing impressions and snapshots rather than excessive detail.<br /><br />Johnny Cash was, as many people are, and incredibly complicated person.  It would have been impossible to present the complexities of his life in any detail in two hours.  Director James Mangold went for impressions and key incidents, and we walk away feeling that we understand the person of Johnny Cash.  Mangold leaves lots of room for others who wish to fill in the vast detail of Cash's life, but Mangold has provided the outline and all the detail necessary for the critical early part of Cash's career.<br /><br />In addition to hitting only the highlights, which keeps the movie moving along briskly, the choice of actors was outstanding.  Joaquin Phoenix proves that his acting talents are as good as or better than those of his peers.  Reese Witherspoon proves that her acting talents have been underutilized in light comedy as she makes the role of June Carter Cash all her own.  Even more incredible, both actors sang the music you hear in the movie.  Considering particularly that Cash had a very unique voice, Phoenix was very brave in attempting the songs, and his outstanding effort helps make his role multi-dimensional.<br /><br />To further lend support for the quality of this movie, it received 26 awards, including an Oscar, and was nominated for another 20 awards.<br /><br />Hollywood seems fixated on glitzy special effects movies with mega-million dollar budgets and plots that exist only to support the special effects.  "Walk the Line" is a rare movie that reminds us all that Hollywood can still make a great movie that will appeal to those of us that like to hear stories of average people that became winners.  "Walk the Line" is one of the best movies of 2005, and is likely to be one of the best movies of the first decade of the new millennium.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.<br /><br />The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>The lead actors sing with their own voices in a very convincing fashion. Reese Witherspoon brings June Carter to the silver screen opposite Pheonix's Johnny Cash. In a true story of a love that begins as a childhood crush (little Johnny listens to June on the radio before meeting her years later as an adult) and later a pining that last several years, June and Johnny take may roads before finding their way back to one another. It's a relationship fraught with Cash's addictions, marriage, inner demons, family fueding and Carter's own turmoil, career highs and lows, and years of refusing to acknowledge her own feelings for Cash.<br /><br />The most telling scene is their duet on The Johnny Cash show that reflects Cash's despondency that Carter will never be his:<br /><br />It Ain't Me, Babe Lyrics<br /><br />Go away from my window,<br /><br />Leave at your own chosen speed.<br /><br />I'm not the one you want, babe,<br /><br />I'm not the one you need.<br /><br />You say you're lookin' for someone<br /><br />Who's never weak but always strong,<br /><br />To protect you an' defend you<br /><br />Whether you are right or wrong,<br /><br />Someone to open each and every door,<br /><br />But it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.<br /><br />Go lightly from the ledge, babe,<br /><br />Go lightly on the ground.<br /><br />I'm not the one you want, babe,<br /><br />I'll only let you down.<br /><br />You say you're lookin' for someone<br /><br />Who will promise never to part,<br /><br />Someone to close his eyes for you,<br /><br />Someone to close his heart,<br /><br />Someone to die for you an' more,<br /><br />But it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.<br /><br />You say you're looking for someone<br /><br />Who'll pick you up each time you fall,<br /><br />To gather flowers constantly<br /><br />An' to come each time you call,<br /><br />A love you for your life an' nothing more,<br /><br />But it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>My introduction to Johnny Cash's music was when I was eight years old. My father started collecting his albums (8-tracks actually) and whenever we were on the road he'd pop one in and we'd listen to I Walk The Line or Ring Of Fire or Folsom Prison Blues; those were the main ones anyway. My dad wasn't a big music fan back then - he was extremely selective - but Cash was his exception. Not knowing what Johnny's music was all about, I really didn't give much thought as to why my father should or shouldn't like the singer ("He sings real good, doesn't he Dad?" "Yes he does"). This might seem more like a family reminiscence on my part but humor me for just one more minute.<br /><br />My father was pretty conservative: he paid his taxes on time without question, was a Marine, believed in the death penalty, enjoyed any kind of sports, and coached in a Pop-Warner football league.<br /><br />Fast forward to this movie, Walk The Line, and I have to wonder why my father felt so strongly for this man's music. Johnny Cash was anything but conservative. Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash - from his humble beginnings on an Arkansas farm to his nearly fatal brush with amphetamine addiction - shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him. He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock-a-billy sounds that were just emerging onto the airwaves. Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best-selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).<br /><br />So what was it about Johnny Cash that pulled my dad into his fandom?<br /><br />Well, this movie shows us. Johnny Cash's voice ("Like a freight train coming `round a bend but sharp as a razor") is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role. It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip-sync any of the songs, but sung them all himself. And although Johnny Cash's voice was a bit coarser and deeper, Mr. Phoenix should be congratulated for his singing talent. He amazed me.<br /><br />The shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Who could've guessed that this Legally Blonde comedic talent could act so dramatically? Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip-syncing ... just as Joaquin had.<br /><br />But I do have two complaints. First, I didn't much care for the ending. I felt it was abrupt and tried too hard to tie everything up into a nice "family package" in just a few minutes. Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).<br /><br />Still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry. I'm sure my dad loved it, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This is a riveting movie which chronicles the life of Johnny Cash.  He is shown as a boy who admires his older brother Jack who plans to become a minister.  When Jack is killed in a tragic accident, his father turns on Johnny in his grief.  This puts an indelible impression on Johnny who feels that he is never good enough for his father or for anyone else.  The movie jumps ahead to Cash's life in the military and his attempts to be a door-to-door salesman.  From the earliest days his passion is music and eventually he makes a success of himself by singing songs which he has written.  His marriage suffers from long separations when he is performing on the road, and he gives in to the temptations which fame brings.  He has a longstanding admiration for June Carter, which grows into love, but she resists being connected to a man who is addicted to pills and other women.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon shine in the starring roles and the chemistry between them is evident, especially when performing Johnny Cash songs such as "Ring of Fire".  This movie is highly recommended viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>in 2005, i had to say my favorite movies were Brokeback Mountain, Crash, and this film Walk the Line. i was slightly dissapointed that it wasent nominated for best picture but at least Witherspoon got a well deserved oscar, otherwise i would be PO'd. the film, like last years Ray, tells the story of another music legend. this time, Johnny Cash. we see his upbringings from childhood, to the time he enrolled in the army, marrys his girlfriend, and then that day he walks into that studio and earns himself a spot on the label. then the film focueses on his love for June Carter and it then plays on out like a Johnny Cash song. i thought the performences were exceptional from Pheonix playing the rugged Cash and Witherspoon, wow has she grown. its hard to belive this is the same girl who played the 'dumb blond' Elle Woods in the legally blonde series. her performence definently deserved that oscar and i'm proud of her. so, see the movie thats on my top 10 list and you'll be blown away.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I loved Joaquin as JR Cash, perfect depiction and Reese was marvelous also.  I must admit I felt so bad for Vivian Cash though!  I hope things worked out for her later and she found some happiness.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>No doubt, that the acting performances by Phoenix and Reese are top-notch and really fabulous and for that aspect this movie is worth 5 stars. The life of Johnny Cash up to a certain time in the late 60s or so is well portrayed, although it's kind of depressing with Johnny's drug use, alcohol, infidelity and so forth. Overall it's an inspiring film, especially for aspiring singer/songwriters, because this film gives them hope that their music may reach a broader audience some day too. And the inspiration aspect alone is well worth watching this flick. The music is great too and as mentioned Phoenix just plays his part so very well and Reese as June Carter does also an excellent job without overplaying the role.<br /><br />The photography has also been executed very well especially regarding the set details for each particular era. It's just that there are a number of slow passages and as every movie should have a beginning, a middle and an end, the ending was rather abrupt and out of the blue so to speak without a lead-in and that bothered me a bit. But overall it's an inspiring movie and well worth watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Reese Witherspoon's victory at last night's Oscars nonwithstanding I was appalled at the lack of recognition by the Academy.  I forget who but one of the participants joked that it was "Ray" with white people.  That's a shame because it diminishes what an impressive work this is.  Though I'm not a fan of country music per se Johnny Cash always garnered my respect and kind of had street cred.  You had to admire Cash's uncompromising devotion to his work and how he carried his pain and personal demons with dignity.  The makers of "Walk the Line" were cognizant of the integrity of their subject matter and unlike "Ray" do not try to mimic the artist their portraying.  Instead they try to channel the spirit and essence of Cash and wholeheartedly succeed.  Joaquin Phoenix may not have the physical build or vocal intonations of Cash but he intuitively understood the essence of the man.  It doesn't take much doing to imagine the Man in Black playing out his own life on the screen.  Witherspoon equals Phoenix in her portrayal of the commonsensical June Carter.  Less is known about Carter than Cash but in Witherspoon's portrayal you can imagine how her guardian angel saved Cash from the abyss of substance abuse.  I have no doubt in my mind that time will be kind to "Walk the Line" and be re-evaluated as the truly great film that it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>and it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture! How could they nominate Hustle & Flow and Munich, while leaving this film (praised by almost everyone who has seen it) in the dust. Joaquin Phoenix is very convincing as Johnny Cash in performance and vocals, and Reese Witherspoon steals the show as June Carter. Reese has got the Oscar, but Joaquin has a much tougher crowd of actors to deal with. I am so glad they aren't making us wait any more months for this DVD. It just left theater and we can buy it in less than two weeks. Yipee!</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I'm in a pickle, as with any movie biography. If I say I enjoyed the film and learned something, then there will always be the "experts" who will say how much the movie got wrong or how some things were emphasized at the expense of other, perhaps more important, things. So all I'm going to say is that I enjoyed watching this film, and I think Joaquin and Reese did a great job "impersonating" Johnny and June. I've never been a fan of Cash, but I liked listening to the songs here, and I wanted more singing. The romance between Johnny and June, with all its warts and faults, was touching as well. Even "bad, messed up" people (i.e. people who make lots of stupid mistakes) can work things out, it seems.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Haunted by memories of a tragedy from his dirt-poor childhood, he struggles in the music industry until he finds his niche and releases on the world a new, incendiary sound that mixes genres and redefines boundaries, all while battling drug addiction and searching for a woman who will make him feel whole.<br /><br />But enough about the Ray Charles movie, let's talk about Walk the Line.<br /><br />Johnny Cash is brought to life on screen by Joaquin Phoenix, whose performance out-Foxxes all recent depictions of true-life characters. Phoenix's portrayal finds strength in the actor's ability to pay just enough attention to looking and sounding like Cash without letting it overwhelm him. Other "transformations" of celebrities (Foxx's Charles, Blanchett's Hepburn) seem to be more akin to a Darryl Hammond impression on SNL, as they focus on mimicking the person's mannerisms and end up losing their own humanity.<br /><br />Playing Cash requires Phoenix not only to sing (which Foxx did not), but also to love someone so deeply that the absence of her love drives him to self destructive practices. In the song that leant its title to this film, Cash tells us he keeps a close watch on his heart. He builds walls and drapes himself in black, keeping the world away. While Phoenix captures this stand-offish outward presentation of Cash, he also opens him up, exposing the singer's vulnerabilities. The mysterious Man in Black loves. He cries. He lives.<br /><br />June Carter (Reece Witherspoon) haunts the first hour of the film. She is ever-present in Cash's life, but out of his reach; he listen to her on the radio as a young boy and reads about her first marriage while stationed in Germany. Clearly, the film's central story is their love, told from Johnny's point of view. Once June becomes a steady force in the film, the narrative moves from being the story of Johnny Cash to their courtship. Witherspoon brightens her scenes with a perky energy that masks an inner turmoil equal to Johnny's. On stage, Witherspoon bests Phoenix (a major feat, as he is fantastic) and has a career in country music if this acting thing doesn't work out.<br /><br />Walk the Line's supporting characters read like a Who's Who of 1950s music. Elvis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, etc. The two scene-stealing performances belong to unknown actors (unknown to me) playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Sun Records proprietor Sam Phillips. Phillips' first meeting with Cash provides the heart of the film, as he tells the young musician to sing as if he only has the chance to sing one song for the rest of his life. Phillips is rightly presented as a man who nurtured many young musicians and helped them find the voices that spoke to the masses.<br /><br />My only criticism of the film is criticism I have for most biopics. I expect more from a film than just giving an account of someone's life (Ray, Ali, Man on the Moon). Those stories should be reserved for made-for-tv movies. Walk the Line has great ambitions when concerning the presentation of the material, but a lot of compromises are made on content. Much of the story-lines are clich&eacute;d, as real life has been heavily sculpted to fit a conventional drama (I seriously doubt Cash's father and first wife are as one-dimensional as presented).<br /><br />But Walk the Line does not have the goal of competing with most other dramas. Primarily, it wants to remain faithful to the love story of Johnny and June Carter Cash and present their lives' work in a way that will entertain modern audiences as much as the toe-tappers who listened to them half a century ago. With those goals in mind, this film could not be improved in any way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>This movie was pretty disappointing, and certainly not worthy of the rave reviews it seems to be getting... Now, I'm not one of those people who will write negative rants about movies or actors just because they are popular or win awards... I'm also not writing mean or snappy things just to show how clever I am or how catty I can be, but rather because I sincerely am baffled by the acclaim this film has gotten, and wanted to drop in a few comments that I hope will be helpful.<br /><br />I'm writing this review as a fellow who's been listening to country music since the early '70s, who's written about it quite a bit, played it on the radio for over a decade and thought about it a lot. Johnny Cash is clearly one of country music's great iconic figures, and the story of his courtship with June Carter is a great love story.  No problem there... The trouble lies with the flatness and predictability, the blandness and utterly cliched nature of the storytelling -- everything is telegraphed from a mile away, all the characters and their relationships are thinly drawn and unremarkable, the dialogue is flat and the music fails to overpower or excite.  In short, there's little here that can overcome the difficulties presented by trying to portray such larger than life figures as the Cashes, and while there are little glimpses when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon look a little like the craggy, unglamorous Johnny and June, never for a moment do either of them project the true gravitas and solemnity of their roles.  Although there is some grand and purposeful cinematography, the film itself feels like it could just as easily have been an ABC after-school special from the '70s.  Seriously.  It's just a cinematically and intellectually weak, facile presentation, sadly unworthy of its subject.<br /><br />And then there are the little things -- for example, we see June Carter writing "Ring Of Fire" at some unspecified time (with co-composer Merle Kilgore nowhere in sight), but we never see the payoff, which is that the song became a collossal hit for Cash in '63.  Similarly, his move from Sun Records to Columbia -- one of the biggest decisions of his entire life -- is glossed over in a split-second image as part of a breezy visual montage.  Then there's the gratuitous insertion of would-be country rebel Shooter Jennings, playing the part of his father, Waylon Jennings, in a scene where Waylon and Johnny become roommates while down-and-out in Nashville.  It's kind of a cute in-joke, son playing the father and all that, except that Shooter doesn't look much like Waylon, and he *certainly* doesn't look like Waylon did in the mid-1960s, when the scene is supposed to take place: Jennings didn't have hippie hair and a beard back then.  He just didn't.  It's lame to present him otherwise.<br /><br />Finally... jeez, louise... couldn't the DVD producers even manage to spell Johnny Cash's daughter's name correctly in the subtitles????  Poor Rosanne!  Oh, well.  I guess the answer is, "it's only a movie."  Can't take it too seriously, right?

With all the hype, I figured it would be either great or terrible, but I was wrong. Walk the Line is above average, but that is principally due to the excellence of its actors. Phoenix and Witherspoon are far more inspired than one can imagine. They pay exquisite homage to these deceased legends. It makes you want to go back and watch every documentary ever made just so you can experience the real thing. Phoenix had the great man's every idiosyncrasy down, and the way he hunches his shoulders up as he struts around during live performances was almost eerie. Outside of individual performances, the film itself was rather erratic. One should understand in advance though that this is not the life and times of Johnny Cash. It is his life in the context of his relationship with June Carter which makes it far less interesting than it otherwise would be. Really, the problem with it is that the movie skirts the line between bio and chick flick with the latter being far too pronounced. It is not great cinema but its craftsmanship and devotion to detail place it on a plane far above the rest which Hollywood usually offers.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Aside from "Boy named Sue," "Ring of Fire" and a couple other classic hits, I'm not much of a Johnny Cash fan. Still, I had an indistinct respect for the man, and sensed his genuineness. Bottom line: for a guy who didn't bring much fan loyalty into "Walk The Line," Cash's film biography, I found it tolerable.<br /><br />WTL takes us from Cash's dirt-poor Arkansas roots, where a family accident left him, the ill-favored son, at the mercy of his alcoholic father's demeaning rage. In the Air Force, Cash started writing the songs (though from what impulse the film does not say) that later made him famous. Initially more dogged than talented, Cash got involved with the rockabilly music of the day, toured with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter. The film does a great job illuminating the touring scene in rock and roll's very earliest years. The finale, showing the making if Johnny's famous live album at Folsom prison, was the climax of the film, showing Johnny finally having mastered himself and having a rollicking good time among men who saw into his tortured soul.<br /><br />ALERT! A few spoilers in this paragraph: WTL is chock full of clich&eacute;s about making it in the arts: the intrepid hero who battles self-doubt, family antagonism and an industry that doesn't think he has what it takes; with guts and desire he masters his instrument and becomes a great success, only to lose his way in anonymous sex, pills, booze or dope; After hitting bottom, the love of friends and family help him face the demons of the past, get him cleaned up and move onto greater successes. WTL, like "Ray," mines these familiar veins.<br /><br />WTL is saved from mediocrity by a couple of factors. Joaquin Phoenix does a decent job portraying Cash. Sometimes he looks and acts very much like Cash, other times less so. It's hard, though to know whether he's playing a man who is painfully shy and not good with words, or one who is not that bright. Reese Witherspoon does a creditable job as June Carter Cash, though every now and then "Legally Blonde" peeks through. What really saves the film is the grit it took for Phoenix and Witherspoon to sing their own parts. With Johnny Cash, pure determination took over when all else failed. The leads were able to channel some of that energy into their roles.<br /><br />If it was up to me alone, I'd give WTL 3 stars, but my wife (an Cash fan from way back) thoroughly enjoyed it, earning it one extra star.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Film biographies are always a bit tricky, in my opinion.  I always find myself wondering which parts are "true" and which parts are rearranged, condensed, combined, etc.  For example, in WALK THE LINE, there's a terrifically dramatic scene near the end when Johnny Cash proposes to June Carter.  The circumstances of the proposal are almost TOO perfect, from a storytelling / dramatic standpoint.  Did it really happen that way, or did the filmmakers take liberties because the truth would have been less cinematically interesting?  At least, when I watch fiction, I know it's all made up.  And when I watch "non-fiction", I know liberties will be taken...I just don't know where.<br /><br />That aside, WALK THE LINE is a pretty satisfying film bio.  First of all, Joaquin Phoenix is terrific.  He doesn't really look like Cash...I always thought Cash was a big man...Phoenix is not.  But we forget these surface dissimilarities almost right away, because Phoenix embodies the character in more important ways.  He creates a full-blooded character.  And the fact that he sang the songs himself is pretty amazing.  Again, his voice isn't a dead-on copy (he can't quite as low as Cash), but there are enough times when a particular phrase comes out EXACTLY like we remember that the viewer is completely satisfied.  It was great to hear some older Cash songs that I had forgotten I knew.  Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter, gives her best dramatic performance yet.  She has one great scene when she is shopping in a small general store in some town they are touring through.  First, she meets some admiring fans and her manner in being perfectly lovely to them while still cutting their conversation short is terrific, and moments later, she is confronted by a clerk who heartily DISAPPROVES of June's recent divorce...and Reese's face is wonderful to watch.  We see her shame and a smidge (just a smidge) of anger...and her response (well written, but REALLY well delivered) is great.  This is a time before everyone went around being sarcastic / ironic, and her reply is genuine and non-ironic and painful and totally appropriate.  There are times in the film when Reese's generic "perkiness" comes through a bit more than I would like...but overall, she's quite solid.  Phoenix should certainly get an Oscar nomination...Witherspoon is slightly less deserving, in my opinion, but I wouldn't put up a fight if she did get nominated.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the film plays out a lot of its drama right on stage.  The concert scenes are fabulously believable.  There's great singing and playing of great music, there's totally believable banter (I don't mean the banter is believable...it's totally "staged" for the audiences, but it feels exactly like what would have been delivered to audiences of the `50s & early `60s) and there's a LOT of subtext being played out.  Whether it's the looks Johnny gives to June as she waits off stage, or their chemistry when they sing together...you almost get all you need to know about their relationship by how the shows go.  When Johnny reaches rock bottom with drug use...we see it on stage.  When he's totally enamored of June, we see it on stage.  I love that the film makes this choice with its storytelling.<br /><br />I also want to mention a great supporting turn by Robert Patrick (X-FILES, TERMINATOR 2) who plays Cash's father.  I don't think his part has Oscar written on it...it's not that showy.  But Cash's father has a HUGE influence on Johnny, and Patrick plays him strongly enough that we can palpably feel how Johnny is affected by him.  It's a critical role, and Patrick nails it.  After TERMINATOR 2, his roles on film haven't always been the best.  I hope this gets him some juicier material...Agent Doggett will always have a soft spot in my heart.<br /><br />The movie isn't perfect.  I felt the Folsom Prison concert was just a bit of a dramatic letdown.  Yes, this is a famous album and famous moment in Cash's career, but the film tries to make an awful lot of it, and then they don't actually show us much of the show.  Also, the inevitable closing titles, when we are told in a few superimposed words about the rest of Johnny and June's lives are quite brief and uninformative.  Those two went on to rather amazing careers for another 30+ years.  The care and devotion they were shown in the film is quickly tossed aside in a few glib summary statements.  I think everyone in the audience would have happily sat and read a bit more...especially with some great Cash music in the background.  But these quibbles aside, it's a very entertaining movie and I would give it about 4.25 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Not so much the life-story of "The Man in Black", "Walk the Line" tells of how J.R. Cash became the iconic half of Johnny Cash and June Cater Cash.  It's a story with the ups and downs we've all come to expect from a celebrity bio - the talented artist finds himself trying to deal with family trauma and dysfunction, has bad brushes with substance abuse and is ultimately redeemed by love to become the icon that he's remembered for.  Johnny's start was a precarious one - he sounded horrible until he could learn to channel his past into his music.  The story informs Cash's rise during run-ins with Elvis & Jerry Lee Lewis.  He courts the lovely June Carter.  The Carters are already celebrities in Country music before Cash enters the scene, yet they're down-to-earth, and probably more sympathetic to Cash than June is.  (They get one of the funniest scenes in the movie when, while still June still remains unmarried to Johnny, they giveCash's drug supplier the double-barrel brush off.)  Joaquin Phoenix doesn't quite look like Cash, but he goes the distance when it comes to capturing Cash's talent for injecting gobs of angry and funny energy into his bottomless baritone.  This is best displayed when Phoenix kicks off his show at Fulsom Pen - creating the now historic concert album - with "Cocaine Blues"; Phoenix plays Cash like a demon, a performance alone that should have netted him an Oscar (he lost to Hoffman for "Capote").  Robert Patrick is a surprise with the unenviable job of Cash's father - a stiff and unartistic soul who nevertheless managed to escape alcoholism, yet seems unwilling to help his son out of his own substance abuse problem.<br /><br />In short, it's funny and sad - something that most celeb bios shoot for, but few achieve.  Even if the script seems to lag, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the day.  If anything, you can watch this disc, just to hear them play.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>This was a great movie.

The movie is awesome and wonderful performances by Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash..... The movie deals with Johnny's drug problems and when he sang for inmates at the Folsom Prison..... I truly think that this movie told a little bit about the man in black,but forgot some of his storyline so you would have to watch the E True Hollywood Story..... I think that this movie should have won best picture at the awards,but it didn't..... I think that this movie is a must watched movie and if you love Johnny and June's music then you should check this one out it is worth it!!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I am a huge Johnny Cash fan and have been since I was a little kid. I must say that when I heard Joaquin Pheonix was going to play Johnny Cash I was skepticle. But then I saw a preview and thought, "You know except for being tall enough he has the mannerisms down and I think he can pull this off." I hate Reese Witherspoon in most of her films so that kind of was bad for me too. But I decided to go see it and I was blown away. First both did their own singing and did a good job. I think it might have been top notch if they would have used John and Junes real voices but you can't complain on the out come of them doing their own. The story is also excellent and heartwarming. It has funny moments and also very sad moments. It also shows the downside of showbiz and drug addiction. But it also is inspriring in the story of June and John's love. Also Robert Patrick was excellent as Johnny's father Ray Cash and it really showed Patrick as a very good actor. The story of John and his fathers tension and then finally them declaring a truce and almost reconciling later in life was also heartwarming.<br /><br />This is a very good movie. Even if you are not a Johnny Cash or country music fan you should watch it. Its just good filmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Phoenix really does a great character study here, he nails Cash, I was even surprised at how much he resembled Cash, considering he really looks nothing like him, it was a tribute to the research he did to get his famous mannerisms down..having said that, the movie belongs to the fabulous Witherspoon, she is fantastic in this film, and frankly she has never been more radiant.  She makes June Carter Cash real, she does not play her like a saint, she shows her flaws, but also her inner strength and goodness.  You really buy her deep love for Cash, it's really a career performance.  The movie itself is well paced and you stay with it, at first I thought it ended a bit abruptly, but thinking back on it, the ending was true to the film.  Highly recommended...thanks James.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>I'm the first to admit that I can't stand country music, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this absolutely terrific film about the legendary singer and songwriter Johnny Cash. Walk The Line is without a doubt one of the best films of the year, not just because it brings the tempestuous life of one of country music's greats to the screen, but also because it serves as an outstanding star vehicle for Joachim Phoenix as Cash and Reece Witherspoon as June Carter. Both are absolutely astounding in their respective roles - expect Oscar nominations for both.<br /><br />Director James Mangold has made a rousing movie about Cash and also about Carter, the woman destined to be his wife and his soul mate. It's a movie that resounds with emotions, from heartache, to pain, and to love, with the themes of family dysfunction, the battle for survival, drug abuse, and the triumph of the underdog magically reverberating throughout. There's neither a misstep nor a moment wasted in this enormously entertaining film, which magically combines the elements of foot-stomping musical, powerful backstage drama, and touching human love story.<br /><br />Walk The Line begins as Cash is about to give his famous concert to the inmates of Folsom Prison. As he's getting ready to walk on stage, the story flashes back to Arkansas  in 1944, where the younger Johnny (Ridge Canipe) is  living in the shadow of his smart, generous older brother, a preacher-to-be and the focus of his sharecropping family's hopes. When the golden boy is killed in a freak accident, their father (Robert Patrick) blames Johnny, screaming at him "The Devil did this! He took the wrong one!"<br /><br />Mangold's subtle and intelligent screenplay argues that it was perhaps his dysfunctional relationship with his father, that led Cash to have many of the emotional problems that plagued his later life, and that his search for fame and a career, was perhaps the result of trying to redeem some of the love that he so desperately needed from his family, especially from his drunken and abusive father.<br /><br />Desperate to get away, Johnny joins the airforce and his stationed in Germany. It is here that he buys his first guitar and starts to compose his songs. He returns home to Memphis and marries Vivian (a terrific Ginnifer Goodwin), who has big dreams of a prosperous and happy family life in the suburbs with their children. But Johnny is bored and frustrated; he'd rather be writing music - and he can't wait to ditch his life as a door-to door salesman.<br /><br />He cobbles together a band with a few friends and they audition for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records who is not too impressed with their badly sung gospel tunes. After he challenges Johnny to make him believe what he is saying in his lyrics, Cash delivers a heartfelt song he wrote about being down and out. Phillips signs the band as Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two.<br /><br />But it is the meeting with June Carter (Witherspoon) backstage at a concert that really changes Cash's life.  The daughter of the legendary Mother Maybelle Carter, she has grown up as a member of country music royalty. Not equipped with the vocal talent of her sisters, she has become a stage comedian known for her spunk and ability to reach the hearts of an audience with her charm and wit. Johnny is immediately attracted to her, but there's a snag: he's married, and soon she is too.<br /><br />As Cash fame grows, he quickly develops a dependence upon amphetamines, using them to help him get through the pressures of touring, sleeping with the girls who so obviously adore him, creating new songs and albums, and assuaging his guilt over not spending enough time with his wife and daughters. June, is obviously enamored of him, and loves him dearly, but all she can really do is watch on as the country singer grows ever more self-destructive. Call it a type of tough love.<br /><br />But it is only through ten years of friendship with June, that Cash is finally able to see the light, and come to terms with his past, his Catholicism, and the emotional demons that have haunted him for so many years. The film is so exquisitely crafted, and full of such powerful moments that viewers will not help but fully appreciate the tender love that blossoms between Johnny and June. She helps him see his true worth, and he draws out her songwriting talent, which culminates in the classic Ring of Fire.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that both Reece and Joaquin do their own singing, and this certainly adds an element of immediacy and authenticity to the proceedings, which would not have otherwise been captured. Phoenix is utterly compelling as Cash, his performance digs deep, burrowing utterly into his character's wounded soul; he doesn't just mimic Cash he is Cash! Phoenix is both frightening and pathetic, especially in the periods where he's high on drugs; he gives a totally brave and terrifyingly real performance.<br /><br />Witherspoon shows us how Carter used her perky stage presence to disguise her repeated romantic disappointments. Girlish one moment and steely-smart the next, she offers exactly the sort of mixture of tough love and bruising tenderness that Cash so desperately needed.<br /><br />When both Witherspoon and Phoenix sing together, the screen lights up with a vibrancy and energy that is totally awe-inspring and also heartbraking. Walk The Line is not only a crowning achievement for both of these talented actors, but it's also a marvelous celebration of two soulmates who eventually find one another in a hard-won and richly deserved happy ending. Mike Leonard November 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>The short reply to describing "Walk the Line" is that it is a solid, real-life story of redemption, of a man who finds out who he is and sings from his heart. The story of Johnny Cash's life is told well, sung well, and produced well.<br /><br />Johnny Cash's life is one spared of the consequences of his worst mistakes. When his first wife left him after realizing Johnny's character was in question, when drugs and affairs began to ruin him, he found June. When drugs and alcohol took him down, he found his soul and his way back up.<br /><br />"Walk the Line" covers the transformation of a child blamed for his brother's accidental death, the drive to succeed as a gospel singer, and the desire to be loved without restrictions.<br /><br />I like Johnny Cash. Always have. His voice sounded off-the-cuff, like someone called him on stage unexpectedly. It is rough, resonant with tobacco and alcohol strained vocal cords, with enough twang to keep it country and enough power to keep it rock. All of these come through adequately in Joaquin Phoenix's attempts, but he's no Johnny Cash. That's a tough act to follow, and I give Phoenix credit for as much as he pulls off musically.<br /><br />Beyond my thoughts of Phoenix's mediocre singing, I give him applause for acting. Not only does he have Cash's signature talking from the side of his mouth, but he has the attitude, the stare, the characteristics that remind me of the Johnny Cash seen on TV throughout the years.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon delivers a persona of June Carter that is extraordinarily sweet. It has to believe she went through so many marriages before finally settling on Johnny. She sings well, and to the ear who has not heard the original, she's enjoyable. The comparison between the two is not fair: one is a musical icon, and the other is only portraying the icon.<br /><br />As storytelling goes, the movie ends in the late 1960s. Johnny and June's life is summed up with that they lived happily ever after. It misses the complete transition, where Johnny's broken life appears to have been a dream, where he goes on to sing more great songs, and even sings for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association crusades.<br /><br />To compare the three recent biopics I have seen, this is the best. While "Ray" is powerful, Ray Charles' own life only evolves. It never transforms. He is only a great singer and a good man at the end. Johnny becomes a great man after not being much of one.<br /><br />In "Beyond the Sea," it lacks by comparison because, partly, Bobby Darin's life was shorter and less dramatic, and also, Cash's catalog of hits is volumes larger.<br /><br />By the end of "Beyond the Sea," I was tired of a few songs. In "Walk the Line," I kept thinking, "Where's 'Don't Take Your Guns To Town,' 'Guess Things Happen That Way,' and 'Sunday Morning Coming Down'? What about 'A Boy Named Sue'?" I wanted more music. Those are fantastic, but the movie's director could not use them all.<br /><br />Shaky parts of the movie are found in how it seems Johnny's spiral downward always held to a glimmer that he was a good man making bad choices. However true that is, it came off whitewashing some of the uglier sides of his hard times, and missed an opportunity to show why his songs have credibility.<br /><br />See it in the theater to enjoy their sound system while you still can.<br /><br />I fully recommend "Walk the Line."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>My rating is actually pretty kind. I love Joaquin and he did a phenominal job, but the movie itself was kind of on the boring side. It dragged way too long and the length should definetely have been cut. There are a few bright spots, like the acting and music, but perhaps its that I am just not a fan of the biopic type films.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>This was a lovely romantic story based upon Johnny Cash's life beginning as a poor farmers son listening to the radio, and the series of events leading to his being a major star and married to his childhood idol June Carter.  Of particular enjoyment were the scenes early in his career where Cash was touring and partying with Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Elvis.<br /><br />As seems inevitable in a biopic about a major star, we see the ravages of touring and drugs, how they almost ruin his life and then he is able, with the support of June Carter and her family, to kick the habit.  The contrast between June's loving family and Cash's hard unforgiving father makes you see how a lack of love in childhood can cause severe damage to an adult and result in self-destructive behaviors.<br /><br />"I Walk the Line" is more of a story of how an emotionally damaged man repairs his psyche enough to have decent relationships rather than the development of a star and his calling as a musician.<br /><br />Joacquin Phoenix does a nice job but the real star of the film is  Reese Witherspoon whose beauty and talented portrayal of June Carter steal the show.  Definitely a must see!</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>In general, biographical films tend to be troublesome: how do you do justice to ANYONE's life in 120 minutes?  Much less a musical legend with a life full of such intrigue and drama that it could fill several years worth of the National Enquirer, front to back?<br /><br />First of all I must admit that I am not generally a fan of many things that are front and center in this film, those being country music, musicals, Jonny Cash, and heavily biographical films in which we're shown the rich artist as a poor, lil child, only to turn into a major singer later in life, complete with tough breaks in love and all sorts of drug and alcohol problems. That said, if you're looking at this film on paper, that's pretty much what you get, but if you actually watch the movie, you'll get a lot more out of it, mainly due to the film's two lead actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both of whom take over their real-life counterparts' personas entirely, and deliver two of the most resonant performances of the year.<br /><br />I found myself utterly swept away with this gritty yet utterly enchanting story of Jonny Cash and the story of the great love that grew between country stars Cash and June Carter during the early years of Cash's career. "Walk the Line" is the result of intense collaboration between director James Mangold, co-writer Gill Dennis, Johnny Cash, and June Carter Cash. Though both Cashes died in 2003, they oversaw the script's development for seven years. Mangold and Cash's insistence that the film's stars would actually sing paid off. Witherspoon's singing (as June) is lovely, and Phoenix's contains the raw energy and soul that defined Cash's sound. Even as a child on a cotton farm in Depression-era Arkansas, Cash shows a strong interest in music, escaping from his no-frills life and strict father (Robert Patrick) through hymns and listening to the radio. When his brother dies in a freak accident, young Johnny feels responsible, and worries that he will never live up to his brother's goodness.<br /><br />The film follows Cash through his first marriage with Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin) and into the early stages of his touring career alongside such musicians as Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and most importantly, June Carter. As Cash's success grows, so does his relationship with drugs, alcohol, and Carter, putting a strain upon his family life. From his initial audition with Sam Phillips of Sun Records on through his legendary 1968 concert at Folsom Prison, Cash is transformed from a hesitant singer riddled with demons to a man whose uniquely bold style would make music history.<br /><br />At the film's opening, Cash (Phoenix) sits alone in a side room fingering a saw blade, then flashes back to his childhood on a cotton farm. His overbearing father (Robert Patrick) blames him for his older brother's accidental death, which may or may not have been prevented had Cash been working with him instead of fishing. The severity of Ray Cash's "it should have been you, J.R." mentality will stay with Johnny Cash always, creeping into his songs and his medicine cabinet.<br /><br />The story is simple enough, and at times conventional. Cash's relationship with his first wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), is relegated to the standard "we can't make rent," and, "I'm jealous of those screaming girls on the tour" kind of strife, which no doubt happened, but wasn't there something deeper?<br /><br />Nonetheless, Mangold creates savory moments that not only subvert convention, but yield new insight. Cash's first session with Sam Phillips at Sun Records (a bit part played like a big one by Dallas Roberts) - when Phillips preaches to Cash and his dopey-eyed backup gospel singers about the kind of songs that really save people (the kind that sell records) - is one of the more sheerly fun scenes in film this year; second, perhaps, to the theology lesson delivered by Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne).<br /><br />These moments - what it's like in the car with Cash, Lewis and gang - are the sort of things easily left out of a biography, and they are the kind of details without which a biography seems devoid of the life it's trying to explain. Witherspoon becomes the unlikely anchor of this film - the peg around which all of its honesty is tethered. We see it in the way she responds to a store clerk lecturing Carter on the moral implications of divorce, and in the way she instantly recovers, on the surface, because she has to buoy Cash.<br /><br />"Walk the Line" never attempts to paint a full picture of Cash's prolific career, but instead focuses on the passions that drove his music and on the woman who gave him strength. With magical performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix, a haunting and inspiring American romance is brought beautifully to life. All together now, "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaw, now wasn't that the cutest little love story?"<br /><br />"Walk the Line" leaves approximately 35 years of Cash's life untouched, and has gaps in much of the time it does cover. This is a good thing. Many films about legendary figures forget that legends make their own records. These films try to cover too much ground and suggest that all of life's conflicts should be resolved, or reach an end. But the best ones leave an open door, recognizing that legends - the dark parts, happy parts, and all - never stop revealing themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>I thought that there was something wrong with this movie.  Johnny Cash appears one-dimensional, and the story kept jumping from one incident to another.  If they kept a bit of continuity, (like showing how he gained acceptance in his field rather than cut from him making his first record in a country store to being a spectacularly famous singer with a spectacular following) it would more cogent and more enjoyable.<br /><br />I remember Johnny and June Cash as people with more substance than this movie shows.  The movie was a poor attempt to capitalize on the memories of these two performers who are still in the minds of much of their public.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Walk the Line (Widescreen Edition)~ Joaquin Phoenix is such a good movie that I am in earnest left speechless. Witherspoon is truly astounding in her role as June Carter and Phoenix is just grand in his portrayal of the man in black. This is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen period and it ranks up their with favorites such as The English Patient and Restoration. The singing (yes they do sing live) is almost to good to be true and Phoenix has been able not just to portray Johnny Cash. He has emulated everything about him and sometimes you forget that you are watching a movie and you start to think that you are seeing something real. The same is true with Witherspoons portrayal of June Carter and one can safely bet that she is an A list actor and will not be doing anymore movies like legally blond 2 anymore.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>WALK THE LINE is a well done, convincing portrait of one of country music's greatest stars.  While not a fan of Mr. Cash myself, I learned a lot more about the man via this movie.  Why it works undoubtedly is the performances given by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Having won Golden Globes for their performances, the two stars are up for Oscars this Sunday as well, and Ms. Witherspoon is a frontrunner.<br /><br />Phoenix captures the essence of Cash in his physical movements, although ironically, he's probably got a better singing voice than Cash.  He evolves from the starstruck youth to a confident star, although he falls victim to alcohol and drugs.<br /><br />Witherspoon doesn't quite lose her Legally Blonde persona, but as the darkhaired June Carter, she excels in evincing the emotional upheaval Cash brought into her life.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin as Vivian, Cash's first wife, does a fine job as she watches Cash grow further and further from his family life and into Carter's arms.  Robert Patrick is good as Cash's distant and seemingly insensitive father and country/pop singer Shelby Lynne makes a convincing Mama Cash.<br /><br />While James Mangold's direction is very good, the movie itself seems a little too sanitized at times, although exposing Cash's weaknesses is commendable.  A good biopic all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>James Mangold's "Walk the Line" is a decent, slightly plodding show-biz biopic that benefits mightily from the astonishing talents of its two stars. If you've seen the film biographies of Elvis, Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, etc., then you've seen this one; the screenplay is fairly standard and doesn't trim all the fat from the story. During some of the expository scenes, I found that I didn't keep my eyes wide open all the time. But when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were on stage together singing, I was all eyes and ears. Phoenix and Witherspoon have so much electricity together that they virtually give off sparks, and if they don't sound exactly like Johnny Cash and June Carter, they're both good singers and do up the Cash-Carter songbook in fine style. Virtually everybody knows the basic outlines of Cash's story, and it's a story as old as the hills: a good man, beset by tragedy and personal demons, finds redemption through faith in God and the love of a good woman. If Mangold's exposition sometimes gets in the way of the story, Phoenix's performance never does; he brings Cash's pain to galvanizing life, capturing the essence of the man without ever resorting to a mere impressionist's trickery. A few critics have accused Witherspoon of giving us too much Reese and not enough June. I don't know enough about June Carter to tell; I only know that Witherspoon is so charming, funny, impassioned and real here that who cares whether she captures Carter exactly? Among the supporting players, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job as Cash's first wife Vivian, and it's not her fault that she appears in some of the more boring scenes. Phoenix and Witherspoon are sure to be remembered at Oscar time, and they are the urgent, overriding reasons to go see "Walk the Line."</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>In watching WALK THE LINE I couldn't help but be struck by the parallels between Johnny Cash's background and that of my mother.  Like him, she was raised in a small Arkansas town (albeit in the hills in the northern part of the state rather than the delta area) in a somewhat rustic house and was often called upon to join her family in picking cotton.  And like Johnny Cash, in an effort to find a better life left the small town she grew up in for Memphis (though she later relocated to Little Rock).  So, this is a movie that is very much about my kind of people.<br /><br />The parallels between WALK THE LINE and last year's RAY will be obvious to everyone who has seen both films.  Both deal with Southern-born musicians who struggled with drugs before eventually kicking the habit.  The romantic parallels are not so sharp, but the relative period of their success was close.  Johnny Cash was not the musical innovator that Ray Charles was, but both achieved a place close to the hearts of Americans.  Interestingly, it was Johnny Cash, the white Arkansan who achieved crossover success as a country performer who was involved in more liberal causes, while the black Floridian Ray Charles was a Republican.  I mention this just to highlight what ironic and unusual paths people's lives can take.<br /><br />The film covers the life of Johnny Cash roughly from his early childhood until just before his marriage to June Carter.  In talking to friends, I have been amazed that even those who have seen the film were unaware of June Carter's background, and when I mentioned the Carter Family they were not clear on who they were.  If there is a First Family in American country music, it is the Carter Family.  Along with Jimmy Rodgers, they were the most influential act in early country music history, and those two along with Hank Williams are the genre's greatest musical influences.  Formed by A. P. Carter, Maybelle Carter was his sister-in-law and one of the most important influences on American guitar finger picking, developing the walking bass note that is fundamental to music ever since.  When A. P. and his wife divorced, Maybelle took over the group, involving her daughters in what was essentially the second version of the Carter Family.  June was one of those daughters.<br /><br />Before their deaths June and Johnny Cash gave their blessings to this production and gave final approval to the performers who would play them.  On the acting end of things both performers are simply outstanding, and both fully deserve the Oscar nominations both have received.  Reese Witherspoon is simply adorable as June Carter, generating more charisma than one could think possible.  She is much shorter than the real June Carter, but since Joaquin Phoenix is much, much shorter than Johnny Cash, giving away about a half a foot, their heights are not terribly disproportionate.  Both performers worked vigorously on their singing in preparing for the film.  Reese, especially, does a good job with her singing.  She doesn't capture that snarl that made June Carter so much fun to listen to, but she nonetheless does a very credible job singing.  Phoenix gives it a great try, but how could any actor be asked to emulate Johnny Cash?  It simply can't be done.  Johnny Cash had one of the few great bass voices in popular music and even though for the most part he sang in a baritone range, there was always a depth and deepness to his voice that undergirt all he did.  And when he did need to drop down for those low, low, low notes, he did so effortlessly.  Phoenix simply can't pull it off. It really isn't his fault at all.  No other actor I know of could have done any better.  He does, however, at least pull off a lot of the rambunctiousness of the young Johnny Cash.  My daughter when in junior high bought a poster of the young Johnny Cash and put it in her room.  It shows Johnny Cash leaning forward from the stage towards the audience, almost savage in his demeanor, pointing one hand towards someone in the crowd, middle finger extended in an obscene gesture.  As he aged, perhaps calmed by his relationship with June it became more difficult to discern that wild man, but Phoenix certainly captures much of that.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good movie and I enjoyed every aspect of it.  My only serious regret is Phoenix's singing.  This is unfortunately not a peripheral matter.  Johnny Cash possessed one of the most unique, marvelous voices of his generation, and having anyone play him who cannot absolutely nail the singing would be a mistake.  It would be like having someone play Frank Sinatra.  You have to get the voice.  Still, it would be a hard person who couldn't find a great deal in this film to love.  And if for no other reason, one has to see this simply to see how precious Reese Witherspoon is.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I was not exactly feeling this movie, but I did give it a chance.  It was entertaining and the music numbers were great, they were the best part of the movie.  I liked Joaquin Phoenix better in "To Die For" and I liked Reese Witherspoon better in "Election".  I think Reese Witherspoon should have won an Oscar for that role rather than this one.  But she did a good job with the musical numbers even though she definatley does not have a genuine country voice.  (Even she herself admits she can't really sing 100 %).  I was more impressed with the music "bio" about Ray Charles with Jamie Foxx.  It was a much better film than this.  Alot of other people including my neighbor and the people at the video store agreed that this wasn't that great of a movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I think that "Walk the Line" is less a biopic about Johnny Cash than it is a love story, and the most touching and believable one I've seen since "Brokeback Mountain". Joaquin Phoenix, whose deep, sad eyes have added emotional depth even to comedies like "Parenthood" and "To Die For", plays Johnny Cash as a passionate, intuitive artist, a hopeless romantic and a wounded, sometimes self-destructive soul. To his first wife, he's an irresponsible dreamer who's off chasing rainbows leaving her stuck with the everyday responsibilities of raising their children. So it's no wonder he finds himself smitten by June Carter, who radiates down-to-earth charm and maternal kindness. Now that I've finally seen this film, I can totally understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her performance. She plays June Carter as a complicated woman; sweet and tough, humble and charismatic, passionate and moral. After seeing "Brokeback Mountain" I asked myself why it was that the most believable love stories are always the sad ones. "Walk the Line" offers a convincing love story with a happy ending. Who knew such a thing was possible?</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film but it's not as good as everyone was saying it was. The film is good and at times the film is great but at times you want more with the film. The film is about Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter but that's about it. I found there could of been more of a story then there was. the acting is good from Joaquin Phoenix who doserves his oscar nod and he might win,  Reese Witherspoon shines (she shines in everything) and she might win an oscar too (I found soem of the other actress in the catoagory better then her). Overall the film is good and I recomand it you will be mesmerized at times through the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" is a good film with very good performances.<br /><br />Virtually every great artist has one thing in common. At some point in their life, they abused alcohol, drugs, the opposite sex, their lover(s), their children, themselves, friendships or a combination of any of the above. In many cases, they overcame these problems to go on and create even more outstanding work, cementing their reputations in history. For a few of these people, the problems proved too much, bringing a premature end to a promising life. Hollywood executives recognize that either scenario is pretty much guaranteed to help create an interesting film because each is inherently filled with drama. Therefore, it stands to reason that any biopic of a musician will feature the same element, the lead character overcoming an obstacle. Without this, the story wouldn't be as interesting.<br /><br />Because we know that a biopic of a musician is going to feature a struggle, of some type, some of the inherent drama dissipates. It would, after all, be boring to watch a film about an artist who has a great life, no problems, everything is rosy. Fortunately, the last few musician biopics have married their familiar stories with great performances and good to great directing, enhancing our appreciation of their life. Last year's "Ray" features an outstanding performance by Jamie Foxx, who brings the character to life, with the aid of director Taylor Hackford.<br /><br />If "Walk the Line", the new biopic about Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, were made a few years from now, there would be fewer comparisons to the Ray Charles film. But as it comes on the heels, comparisons are inevitable and will be plentiful.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a good job of bringing singer Johnny Cash to life. He doesn't really attempt to imitate the icon as much as interpret his life. At times, especially when singing, Phoenix's voice attains the deep, resonant timber of Cash's, but he doesn't walk around mimicking throughout. This seems entirely natural. When he is performing, singing, his stage persona is different, selling himself as a character to his adoring fans.<br /><br />At times, I found myself thinking "Wow, Joaquin Phoenix is doing a good job." More often than not, Phoenix was doing a good job acting. Phoenix acts, he doesn't become. Because we are pulled out of the performance like this, recognizing his work as an actor, he doesn't completely transform himself into the singer. Jamie Foxx managed this on a much more consistent basis, transforming himself into Ray Charles. He became the singer, losing himself in the mannerisms, speech and actions of the singer. In a way, Foxx was mimicking Charles, but he was doing this so completely and successfully he got lost in the character.<br /><br />Remarkably, Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did all of their own singing and this is where Phoenix really shines. As mentioned, his voice reaches a deeper timber, reminiscent of the singer's and it is difficult to tell that it isn't Cash singing. I am not overly familiar with the Johnny Cash songbook, but when Phoenix sings, the signature tunes sure sound authentic.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, the love of Johnny Cash's life. I think people are generally much less familiar with her life and her work, so Witherspoon has a great deal more latitude in her performance, building a three dimensional character. Because she is able to more fully become "June Carter", her character is more successful. Witherspoon brings all of the facets of June's life to the screen; she conveys her conflicts with her religion when she gets divorced (for the first time), she conveys her friendship for Johnny, her ability to help him through his addiction, her onstage persona and more.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon also does her own vocals throughout. In Witherspoon's case, it is easier to tell that it is the actress singing. Her voice doesn't change and you recognize her accent throughout. I can honestly say I wouldn't recognize a song sung by the real June Carter Cash, so I have nothing to compare her vocal abilities to, but she also sounds good.<br /><br />The two performances are very good, but it is strange that the actor portraying the less recognizable person should be more successful. Both actors are probably doing comparable work, but because we know more about Johnny Cash, recognize him as an icon, Phoenix has to work harder to make his performance seem interesting, believable and real. Ultimately, Phoenix does a better job with the singing and Witherspoon does a better job with her acting.<br /><br />The film opens with inmates at Folsom Prison chanting and stomping their feet, trying to get Cash to come back from a break and continue the concert. As Cash pauses, trying to relax, he remembers back to his childhood. This is a fairly conventional setup for a biopic. Many recent film biographies wisely chose to depict only a portion of the subject's life, concentrating on this period, going into more depth. In "Walk the Line", the majority of the film tells the story of Cash's life from twelve year old cotton picker to his performance at Folsom Prison. The performance at Folsom provides a natural climax for the film and his story. And it is a great sequence, with Phoenix channeling the spirit of Johnny Cash, but the real point of this story is the romance between Johnny and June, so the film continues on for a bit until June finally agrees to marry Johnny. This is an interesting moment, and the two clearly loved one another, but the film really should've ended with the performance at Folsom. Continuing on, it seems anticlimactic.<br /><br />Director James Mangold does a good, if unspectacular job with the material. Yes, everything looks good, but the film doesn't match the quality of the performances from the two leads. Mangold's work is a bit disappointing because the film is a really straightforward biopic. The director's previous work includes "Identity", a really underrated thriller with a twist, and "Heavy", his first film, also an underrated independent film. With the exception of the turkey "Kate and Leopold", Mangold's earlier work contains elements that help it rise above the pack. He has shown that he isn't content simply making a big budget studio picture. In "Walk the Line"; he pretty much leaves the visual elements alone, photographing everything in a very straight forward and simple way. Everything looks good, but it doesn't contain any artistic flair.<br /><br />Also, there are more than a few scenes involving Johnny, June and a number of other rising musicians touring on the same circuit. These rising musicians included Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. Jerry Lee Lewis is given the most screen time of the group and the actor playing him, Waylon Payne, seems to have a lot of fun bringing the outrageous musician to life. The remainder of the group sticks mainly to the sidelines, offering brief glimpses of them before and after they perform. Because we see so little of them, except for a few of the familiar iconic trademarks of Presley and Orbison, they seem to be almost cartoon characters, they serve as distractions, pulling us out of the story every time they appear. Cash says something to Elvis as they pass during a concert, then Cash stops to watch Elvis perform for a few moments. Then our attention is drawn to the audience is looking at Elvis on stage and the actor playing him. "Oh, so he knew Elvis..." At this point, it takes a few moments to get lost in the film again. It would have been better to actually never see these characters, maybe only catching glimpses of them, from the wings, or from behind, the bright stage lights obscuring their features.<br /><br />A biopic should teach you something significant about the subject's life, something you didn't already know. Because "Walk the Line" is about two people, we should learn something about both of the characters. Ultimately, we learn more about June Carter, through Witherspoon's performance, partly because of the actor's work and partly because we know less about Johnny Cash's true love than we do about the iconic singer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>I learned some valuable lessons from this movie, and consider myself much instructed thereby.<br /><br />One thing I learned from watching this is that adultery is cool.  Marriage is just another obstacle to get around.  See, if you've got a dream, and your spouse stands in the way (for example by suggesting that you pay some attention to her and help provide for your progeny), it's totally okay to dump her and latch on to someone more exciting, someone who believes in you.  Everything will be considered your wife's fault for having opposed your dream in the first place.<br /><br />(Johnny and Vivian's daughter, Rosanne Cash, was reportedly furious over this movie, claiming that her mother actually encouraged her father's music playing, the complete opposite of what is portrayed in the film.)<br /><br />Is it just me?  Has adultery and dishonoring one's marriage vows gone so completely out of fashion that filmmakers will portray a man callously ditching his wife and family, and yet not even seem aware of what they're showing?  The whole emphasis in this film was on how Johnny's spirit "needed to be free" so he could make his wonderful music.  Not a whiff of (or even a consciousness of) the moral problems presented by such behavior.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just getting older, but I'm getting sick of this crud.  And I've been noticing more and more of it.  Next time I see a movie doing this, I'm just gonna shut it clean off.  Those who toss their wives to chase their muses have nothing to say to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Walk The Line is a well crafted movie featuring exceptional performances.  It's long, and there are whole sections where little seems to be happening, (or worse, the same things seem to be happening over and over), but it's worth it for two short scenes.<br /><br />The first is when Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) cleans up his act (for the moment) and walks onto the Folsom Prison stage a fully formed star.  At that moment he is in complete command of his technical abilities and sense of self.  He is contrite and cocky, even feisty, and gives his audience exactly what they want and need.<br /><br />The other is almost antithetical.  June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is alone on stage, bathed in a blue spotlight.  She is performing Wildwood Flower, accompanying herself on autoharp.  Her tone is clean and open, this is a woman who grew up in music, the stage is where she feels most comfortable.  She doesn't dazzle, she merely gives.  Wildwood Flower is an example of purely beautiful Appalachian folk music, a far cry from the ersatz Elvis eyewash forming the foundation of Cash's early career.<br /><br />Though strong, the film has major flaws.  For one, country music itself is almost a total write-off, it's borderline unlistenable.  Next, Cash was never much of a singer, which explains his tuneless mumbling.  The Man In Black was also just an average guitarist, although he did pen a few catchy songs.  June Carter, by contrast, was a treasure and Reese Witherspoon's performance is nothing short of amazing.  Witherspoon captures all of Carter's ebullience, energy, and sheer charm, without ever seeming artificial.  This raises another point.<br /><br />Lately it's fashionable for actors playing musicians to do their own singing, presumably in an attempt to lend authenticity.  This charmingly idiotic conceit is exclusively predicated on thespian vanity.  (Does James Brown perform Shakespeare In The Park?  Think about it.)  Film is artifice, acting is artifice, why intersperse documentation?  In fact, having Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon lip-synching would be more, not less, authentic.<br /><br />Another drawback is that the story, however accurate, is a weather beaten cliche.  A tormented kid of humble means and limited emotional resources fails to navigate the corridors of fame successfully, falls, and gradually pulls himself out of the gutter a sadder but wiser man.  It's beyond tired, it's plug-and-play.  Of course, the Johnny Cash story is already well known so this paint-by-numbers exercise is even less surprising than usual.<br /><br />Biopics leverage pre-existing fame and convert it to income, after all, the advance work is done.  Since there are no surprises to be had, the only question is - is WTL well done?  Fortunately, the answer is yes.  Phoenix and Witherspoon both dazzle.  Had Cash been more than a two-chord picker boasting a deep baritone and a vocal range almost approaching one full octave, had he, for example, been an actual artist with something worthwhile to say and an interesting way of saying it, it would be easier to care about his simplistic obsession with self-destruction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A thoroughly pedestrian biopic that retailors the real story so much that it should probably be called "Johnny Cash as Written by John and June" (case in point: the song Walk the Line was written for John's first wife, not June) Walk the Line fails on almost every level aside from its performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>James Mangold, the director who brought us such flawed but interesting<br />films as Copland and Girl, Interrupted, has done it again. He has<br />crafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named after<br />one of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of Johnny<br />Cash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her<br />portrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Family<br />singers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merely<br />another way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy young<br />starlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia<br />Roberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, Charlize<br />Theron, and now Witherspoon. Financially, for the long term of the<br />industry, this makes sense, so that, even decades from now, films they<br />appear in can bear the Oscar imprint.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Cash, however, is completely out of his<br />league as the infamous Man In Black....Cinematographer Phedon<br />Papamichael adds little to the film. His framing and vistas do little<br />to enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poetic<br />element. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static and<br />dull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not grasp<br />is that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of his<br />singing and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focus<br />on the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going to<br />focus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up the<br />fascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all people<br />go through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer,<br />when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT like<br />the average person. In other words, as the saying goes, always print<br />the legend over the truth. Walk The Line never trots down that alley.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I liked this movie, but it just didn't seem to do justice to the subject. I much prefer "Coal Miners Daughter" as a Biography. The cast does well, but the movie feels choppy to me. I didn't feel like I learned anything about Cash from this and there were huge chunks of his life missing. It is still a good film with it's many flaws and the DVD looks very good. Worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I will probably write a minority review here. This biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix as the famous country singer, Johnny Cash looked very much like a clone of last year biopic, Ray. We got the same theme here, poor upbringing, childhood guilt trip, drug addiction, making it big and losing his family at the same time and the both films end around the same time period, never going into their mature years. Only major differences between the two movies were the color of their skin and sound of their music. The major reason why this movie wasn't an one star movie for all this copycat format was that Reese Witherspoon gave a real fantastic performance as June Carter. While Joaquin Phoenix was good, I didn't think he was great. Witherspoon proves to totally effective and she virtually overshadowed Phoenix in almost every scene they were together. She brought this movie up to a high level by her performance which I thought to be authentic, well interpret and settled. While this may sound bit unfair to Phoenix since he had the hardest job of capturing Johnny Cash without mimicking him, I thought he didn't do that good of job. Maybe the script let him down on that issue.<br /><br />Both of them were well supported by their fellow cast members. The music production was very good and it told the musical story very well. But the script was bit on the weak side. Movie seem to go from episode to episode, home scene to music scene and so on. What made Johnny Cash tick? What were his motivations? Answers seem very superficial here. There just wasn't any major surprises in the movie and although my knowledge of Johnny Cash came from only one book and two CDs, I didn't see him too well on the movie screen.<br /><br />Outside of Witherspoon's superb performance, this movie is basically by the number routine. Isn't there a music star out there who didn't have poor upbringing, who didn't have some sort of childhood guilt trip, who wasn't a drug or alcohol abuser and didn't lose his family when he made it big???</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>by the end of the opening scene. something's wrong.

After all, I really do love country music.  And Johnny Cash is one of my favorites.  But Joaquin Phoenix doesn't look like him and that bothered me during the whole film.  And Reese Witherspoon, cast has his lady-love June Carter did a good acting job, but I never really could relate to her.  Yes, there is chemistry between these two actors.  But this film needed more than that to really hold my interest.<br /><br />One of the problems with the story is that its all been done before.  A musician with a humble background who made good in the music industry, has a deep relationship with someone other than his wife, and who turns to alcohol or drugs because he can't escape blaming himself because of the death of a sibling.  The film "Ray" was all about that and was a better film.  "Walk the Line" seemed like a weak remake.<br /><br />I liked the music of course.  That was good.  But the story was slow and predictable.  The film did have its good parts but I just couldn't get into it and can therefore only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>By my 4 star review you would think that answer would be yes, right? Well, if we're talking Johnny Cash, the answer is actually NO. Being a "good movie" and a "good representation" are not one in the same.<br /><br />My reflections after the credits rolled were, that the movie was good, the performances were good, the movie moved, but didn't move ME. So much of the songwriting and band relationships were cast aside, and while I do appreciate the role June Carter had in JC's life, the movie made it appear as though he did nothing but stalk her. I can also appreciate the fact that the script could only be "so long" but how many 3 hour gladiator/super hero/against all odds movies have we all sat through that were TOO LONG? I say this movie could have been another hour (at least)and it wouldn't have seemed like it. In fact, Johnny Cash deserved as much.<br /><br />In many ways the movie seemed like a cut-and-paste story of any "rock star" and sadly, I expected more. "Walk the Line" is a fine example of heartfelt movie making, but considering the subject matter, should have been a lot more painful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Prior to watching this, I'd never heard of Johnny Cash. Apart from the fact he'd died, and someone on American Idol had sang "Walk The Line", which I absolutely loved the lyrics to. For some reason, I just had to get this film. My dad asked me why, my mum asked me why, my boyfriend asked me why, and I had no really good answer to give them. I just wanted to see it.<br /><br />I have no real interest in Joaquin Phoenix either. He irritates me. Yes, I like Reese Witherspoon, but the film isn't about her. But apparently, he's really well suited to the role (you forget it's actually him soon enough, even that annoying scar which looks like a cleft palate), and has an alright voice.<br /><br />Both of the actors did their own vocals, taking six months vocal training to learn and be Johnny & June Cash. I had to actually put the subtitles on for Reese Witherspoon though, with a strong southern accent, I could not understand a word the girl was saying! The songs were could, toe tapping but forgettable - apart from "Walk The Line".<br /><br />My one quibble about Walk The Line, is the fact huge chunks of time were deemed not important enough to be included in the film, making the film seem almost jumpy. There is some stuff I would have dumped in order to see more of his early life, and most importantly, life after him & June finally got married & got together. After getting married, they were together 35 years, why not show some more of that?<br /><br />I have to applaud Reese, she did hold her own in the film, a role that could have been reduced to a few lines, a song, and more a redneck hick role.<br /><br />Elvis also appears in this, and although he's not in it for long, he really irritated me, as they could have chosen a better Elvis lookalike from all the thousands that there are out there! I have never seen a guy look less like Elvis ever.<br /><br />It does get slightly boring in parts, as I've said before, there are big jumps in time, and you feel like there's something in there that could have been shown, and the ending was a bit of a let down. But the film holds well, as do Reese & Joaquin's voices, but I'm still at a loss to why he was so popular.<br /><br />I keep a close watch on this heart of mine<br /><br />I keep my eyes wide open all the time<br /><br />I keep the ends out for the tie that binds<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />I find it very, very easy to be true<br /><br />I find myself alone when each day is through<br /><br />Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />As sure as night is dark and day is light<br /><br />I keep you on my mind both day and night<br /><br />And happiness I've known proves that it's right<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />You've got a way to keep me on your side<br /><br />You give me cause for love that I can't hide<br /><br />For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" is Reese Witherspoon's final ascent into movie stardom, maybe even her declaration as America's Leading Lady, seeing as Julia Roberts doesn't have much interest anymore, Gwyneth Paltrow's drifted into obscurity, Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts and Charlize Theron were born south of the equator and Renee Zellweger just isn't very good looking.<br /><br />Spunky, cute, self-effacing, Witherspoon's made a lot of crap (and a lot of money off it), a few gems ("Election," "American Psycho"), and this OK biopic about Johnny and June Carter Cash that's a perfect vehicle for her talent - mixin it up with the boys, flirtin, mouthin off, cryin, lovin, hurtin. The Blue Plate Sally Field.<br /><br />Pedestrian director James Mangold wisely builds his movie around John(played  by Joaquin Phoenix) and June's protracted affair that begins on their first tour while they're married. That Cash-brand folk music runs underneath most scenes, but "Walk The Line," aims to be a love story, and succeeds. Phoenix and Witherspoon have the necessary chemistry, and Cash's first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) is slanted as such a grim, unhappy grinch it is a small joy when she orders John to take down a photo of June and walks out when he refuses. It's still several years before June agrees to marry John, but the way is finally clear. There's only a drug habit to kick and some self-abuse to endure.<br /><br />"Walk The Line" has a backstory for all the pain - a mean father (Robert Patrick) who blames John for his brother's death, that grim wife, the drugs, the alcohol, the tours, several bad influences (which include Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis). We assume the music is written somewhere in there; we see John on stage and at Folsom Prison, but not in the studio. Maybe rightly so - Cash was revered more as the Man In Black than as a talent; unlike "Ray," which cared about how Ray Charles created his art and survived by his business savvy, "Walk The Line" envisions Cash as little more than the guy who attends corporate meetings standing up, shades on, some country James Dean with the Holy Spirit bolting through him. Phoenix's performance addresses the legend more than the man. It's all blowups, booze and romance from the gut.<br /><br />Witherspoon does something different with June; she embodies the reluctant-yet-radiant everywoman, a tough skin, soft center, an archetype as old as Shakespeare. June starts with small questions and warm smiles inside a diner. She progresses to a scene when, in a moment of sincere affection, she tells John just what she wants to say about his talent, and what John never has heard from his father or wife. Who doesn't fall in love with that? That June finally falls too makes sense because John adores her.<br /><br />There's no mystery in Witherspoon. No hidden cards. She brings the same tomboyish, attractive skills to every movie, and for each "Walk The Line," there is a "Vanity Fair," where, regardless of her diligence, the magic is lacking. She's not a master talent like Meryl Streep or Kidman, but a punch-the-clock professional who, when she chooses wisely, can pack charm, wit and sweetness into one of the best performances of the year. Audiences like her, they really like her.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>The story basically was about how Johnny wanted June very badly, and how long it took for them to get together. After they get together, the movie ends quickly. I dont know Johnny or June to much, the acting was good but not excellent. I thought Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as June though. The part that I rolled my eyes at was an almost minute scene with Johnny with Waylon Jennings, who was played by his son, Skeeter Jennings. I thought it was a little tacky and would have prefered to see someone play Bob Dylan. Plus forget to tell the story about Johnny kicking out the lights at the Grand Ol Opry. That would have been cool to see. Go see it for Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, other then that, a weak biography of the man in black.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I found myself very interested in the movie, mostly because<br /><br />of the "freight train" sound of early, rockabilly Cash.  The<br /><br />movie could almost be called "Ray II" b/c it follows a similiar<br /><br />structure, storyline, and visual style as the Ray Charles flick. The screen writers made the interesting choice of telling Cash's story up to 1968, which overall worked, but does make the movie plod a bit with its 135 minute length (thank god they deleted a ton of scenes at that).  The performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are as captivating as the music, and overall their love story has intrigue, although it too is a bit drawn out.  Overall, I felt too much time in the heart of the movie was allocated to Cash's drug problem, which heightened the negative feel of the story. Although I realize biographical movies can spread themselves too thin by covering too many aspects/phases of the person's life, I feel this one could've<br /><br />been a bit more dynamic in the approach.  Overall, the storyline was too focused on his failed marriage, pill<br /><br />habit, and love for June.  I felt I didn't learn or experience as much as I could have.  However, overall I'd recommend the movie and the performances, especially for the toe-tappers out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I'd just as soon watched paint dry than see this movie again!!  It was horribly slow!!<br /><br />I enjoy Johnny Cash's music. I also enjoy Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon's acting abilities and felt they both gave great performances in this Johnny Cash Biopic, but felt the screenplay and narrow focus of Mr. Cash's life made the film unbearable.<br /><br />The movie did a complete overkill of Cash's alcohol and drug addiction, overkill on the poor relationship Cash had with his father and need for his father's approval, and overkill on his hot pursuit of June Carter. I think it would have been nice to incorporate other aspects of his life too.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts.  Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold?<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message).  Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice.  And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.<br /><br />But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic.  Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention?  That is up to the voters.  It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy.  But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies.  Just not that impressed.

His life had no influence on me at all.  I actually didn't care if i saw this picture but my partner heard that it was good.  So with no expectations we went to see it.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY.  Everything from story line, costumes, music, set design, acting it was Hollywood first class all the way.  I have never been a fan of Reese Witherspoon either but today i can't speak more highly of her acting.  Joaquin Phoenix sorry to say i never heard of but again this "was" Johnny Cash.  The talents of Reese and Joaquin own singing voice on this film was that of a Broadway show.<br /><br />Not that i'm a Broadway snob but i've worked most of my life on the stage, from Radio City to Broadway to having my own live theatre.  I can be extremely ciritical but this film i give "Thumbs Up."  It just doesn't get any better than this and will be looking forward to the DVD when it comes out.  Great job done by everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F7CCPK4QL359.html">A2F7CCPK4QL359</a><br/><p>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon channels the spirits of Johnny and June Cash. If you don't believe me, watch this film and see<br /><br />This story is about a  young punkish Cash...the one with a drug problem, emotion problems and groweing up problem. He is the  rebel with a  musdical cause. Phoenix does not just play the younger Cash, he dominates the vocals as  well. You can debate if he should have won the Oscar.  I am sorry he didn't but it still is an amazing performance. If you like this, catch him in the  movie Buffallo Soldiers or Ladder 49.<br /><br />And now to the Lady Reese, she is June Carter Cash.  Like Sissy Specek, Ms Witherspoon transformed into June. Her Oscar winning performance was earned and not handed out lightly. Now she can do Legally Blonde three without worrying!<br /><br />X-Files's Robert Patrick is great as Cash's Father ray. He is a stand out in this emsemble cast<br /><br />Do I think this film is a classic? NO, far from it.<br /><br /> However this film is a great piece of  bio filmmaking in the cinema of reality with such films like Ray, Capote, Miracles, and the Great Escape<br /><br />Well worth getting, all the performances are so well done<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Hey my darlin' hey my sweet<br /><br />I've waited on the day that I knew we would meet.<br /><br />Hey my sun, hey my moon<br /><br />Today's the day that<br /><br />Johnny met June."<br /><br />I know that Shelby Lynne wrote "Johnny met June" after the death of Johnny Cash, four months after the passing of June Carter Cash, but it was impossible for me not to think of that song while watching "I Walk the Line," even before I realized that Lynne was playing Cash's mother Carrie.  That is because it is clear from the start of this 2005 bio-pic that this is the love story of Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) and June (Reese Witherspoon).  In the last act of the film my wife expressed surprise that the couple were not married yet and I told her that this film was going to be over as soon as she finally said "yes."  I was close on that score, because the film includes an important grace note and fade out that says it all.  But even if you knew nothing about their legendary love it would be clear from the opening scenes of this movie when a young J.R. Cash and his brother Jack are listening to young June Carter singing on the radio.<br /><br />What I liked about "Walk the Line" was that even knowing the key threads of the story, all of which are cinematic commonplaces, the screenplay by writer Gill Dennis and director James Mangold delivers memorable scenes.  One thread is how Cash became the Man in Black, and when he blows his audition in front of Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), the legendary head of Sun Records in Memphis gives him a slim second chance with a dead on speech as to how Cash needs to be singing songs.  Cash happens to have been inspired by a film about a prison in California to write a song, and he starts to sing it and changes before our eyes and ears.  Cash and his father, Ray (Robert Patrick), have been at odds since a childhood tragedy and we wait for the moment when the son will finally tell the father off.  But when it comes Cash is still living in a glass house and the tables do not get turned.<br /><br />"Walk the Line" saves the best for last.  The famous concert at Folsom Prison is the first of two significant payoffs, as it represents Cash finally embodying his songs and not simply singing them.  The connection between Cash and his audience changed then and he finally became a man.  But that was not enough for June who has been refusing all of his proposals.  When his family could do nothing to save Cash from his drug addiction, it is June and her family who step in, however she makes it clear that she will sing with him but she will not marry him.  Now, most of us remember the lady as June Carter Cash, so we know that she is going to say yes.  What is important is that it clearly will take something special for her to consent, and this film comes up with a moment worthy of their relationship and out anticipation.<br /><br />Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing and what is key is not that they imitate Johnny and June but that they capture their hearts, which is a good thing in a romance, even when it also happens to be a bio-pic.  During the final credits we finally hear the real Johnny and June singing as they take their curtain call.  But when their voices fade away and we return to the plaintive guitar pickin' of T-Bone Burnett our thoughts return to Lynne's lovely elegy:<br /><br />"Now were starting over it's the place that we are<br /><br />You look more than pretty underneath all the stars<br /><br />Love, love is a burning thing<br /><br />Oh how I still love to hear you sing<br /><br />And everything we ever heard about heaven is true<br /><br />Today's the day that Johnny met June<br /><br />Today's the day that Johnny met June."</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Walk The Line captures Johnny Cash's life from 1944-1968.  The movie's plotline derives from Johnny Cash's autobiographies, "Man In Black" and "Cash The Autobiography", which provide an authentic narrative of what the man was about.  The film appears to be two films in one due to its immense content of the film that reveals Cash more in depth.  There are the intimate aspects of the man and his music, and how one of the first couples of country music, John (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter Cash (Reese Witherspoon), came to be making the film a love story about the music and between two people.<br /><br />The film is quite exceptional in capturing the "Man in Black."  Viewers will see the forces that drove him to create a unique blend of music that was all heart and soul: gospel, rock and roll, blues, and country-western.  Joaquin Phoenix's did a well-done depiction of the man, and recreating Cash during the years in which he struggled through his rise to fame, and his brief down and out with drugs.  One can see how Phoenix's performance flowed with Cash's influence within him.  Indeed, Cash helped to kick start rock and roll about the same time as Elvis Presley, especially with his involvement with Sun Records.  His story almost falls into the same lines as Elvis', but Cash's experiences looms deeper and darker than the king, which involved tragedy, blood, sweat, and tears, and final triumph.<br /><br />Walk The Line is recommended for all music lovers, especially those who are curious in understanding the history of rock and roll and the sum of all its parts.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...and I guess, despite some "evil" rumours about wether "Walk the line" is true to Cashs' real life or not, this movie should answer many questions. Personally I didn't really know that much about Johnny Cash before I went to see this movie, and I must say it made a deep impression.<br /><br />It is a sad story, and you really struggle with Cash throughout the movie. His life indeed was no picnic, being the invisible son to his fathers' eyes, the loss of his best friend and older brother favored of the two even long after his early, tragic death (this truely haunts Johnny Cash, and the cold relationship between him and his father), his drug and alcohol abuse the way it grows along with his carreer, his turbulent marriage, Johnny Cash simply doesn't function until he is gradually saved by his one and only true love -June Carter. From his early days listening to her voice on the radio as a kid (she was a child star), it also grows to become a gripping, beautiful lovestory. "Walk the line" introduces Johnny Cash as a kind and gentle, but a soulsick and lonely man. Until the outcome of his relationship with June Carter that is. The ending has a tone of the "...and they lived happily ever after..."-kind, and it is well earned!<br /><br />It is brilliantly expressed between many of his old music-classics, with great acting and the dialogue in focus. The filming could not have been better, and the timing -well, not an uninteresting, dull moment. J.Phoenix is Johnny Cash, R.Witherspoon is June Carter -and I must say that especially she managed to impress me (and perhaps for the first time, the girl can act!) I was impressed by Val Kilmer in "The Doors", I am just as impressed by J.Phoenix from his appearence in "Walk the line".<br /><br />See this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Even though my father is a huge fan of Johnny Cash, I didn't really start to appreciate the man's genius until the last couple years I was in college. That's when I began to see and understand how great a performer and singer Johnny Cash was. The more I learn about the man and his life, the more I am drawn to him. Cash was a man whose music was able to cross all kinds of boundaries: rich and poor, minorities and white people, good citizens and those in jail. His songs (many of his most popular tunes he didn't write) touched people where they were.  They were rooted in the toil of daily living and in the grit and grind of humanity.<br /><br />WALK THE LINE is an excellent biopic about one segment of The Man in Black's life. The movie is not a full-fledged biography. Instead, it is a shorten tale of Cash's life that tells of the love story between John R. Cash and one June Carter.<br /><br />The movie opens with Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) preparing to go on stage at Folsom County Prison to make his comeback (which all the record producers say is impossible to do at a prison). He sees a table saw and is taken back to when he was a child growing up in rural Arkansas. The childhood segment does a couple of important things for the story line. One, it shows that even as a child Cash had an infatuation with June Carter (he listens to her and her family on the radio all the time and stares at her pictures in magazines).  Secondly, it shows that from an early age, Cash knew pain--pain which made him sing like no other, but which also eventually led to his addiction to pain killers.<br /><br />The movie flashes ahead from Cash's childhood to his brief stint in the service until he finally returns home and marries his sweetheart.  Cash is a man of vision, but his wife Vivian (played by the lovely Ginnifer Goodwin) wants John to give up his dream and settle down. Through perseverance and a lot of luck, Cash and his band have the opportunity to perform for Sam Phillips, the legendary owner of Sun Records who discovered not only Johnny Cash but Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis as well. Suddenly, Cash becomes a big star.<br /><br />However, the higher his star rises, the more mixed-up becomes his personal life. Wife Vivian is just not happy with Johnny on the road so much. Johnny becomes more and more addicted to pain killers and alcohol and his childhood infatuation with June Carter turns into full-fledged grown-up love, tinged with a lot of lust.  June Carter knows better and though she connects with Cash, she knows that until he gets his act together they can't be together. The movie follows the relationship between these two until they are eventually married after an on-and-off again courtship of almost decades.<br /><br />The acting in WALK THE LINE is some of the finest in any film this year. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a higher pitched voice than many, does an excellent job of recreating the essence of Johnny Cash's tone and timber (though the real Cash had a deeper baritone/bass).  Reese Witherspoon should be able to put to rest forever all those critics who said she was nothing more than a pretty face who had no talent because as close as Phoenix is to Cash, Witherspoon seems like a cloned version of a young June Carter. The two stars aren't the only ones to shine, because the supporting cast is just as good.<br /><br />The overall tone is somewhat serious because as much as this is a love story, it is a love story about two people who lived really screwed up lives (don't we all?).  That's one of the reasons the movie (like Cash's music) is so powerful; it's real and honest and can touch people where they are.<br /><br />Cash purists can find many faults with the film. There are points that some dramatic liberties are taken. Some characters are only represented one-sided. At times the film moves slow. Despite all this, none of these things really takes away from the film or from the life of Johnny Cash. Instead, the movie augments The Man in Black and illustrates why he was able to become admired by so many and a legend in his time.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"Walk the Line" is the story of Johnny Cash from his childhood in 1944 to the late 1960s.  As a child, we see two people that shaped his life: his brother and his father.  Skip ahead ten years, and Johnny Cash (Phoenix) is married to his wife, Viv (Goodwin), and has started a band.  After getting a record deal, he finds himself on tour with Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter (Witherspoon).  Along the way he finds drugs, which threaten his newfound popularity, and he falls in love with June, which just may save him.<br /><br />Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give excellent performances, sounding and acting just like the stars that they are portraying.  Phoenix is as good, if not better than Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in last year's "Ray".  The story is well told, and it is interesting to see the events that shaped Cash's life, and made him who he is.  Whether you are a Johnny Cash fan or not, "Walk the Line" is a highly entertaining and well made movie that is worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>WALK THE LINE is a look at the life of Johnny Cash (masterfully played by Joaquin Phoenix), "The Man In Black," one of the most well-known and distinctive singers of our time.  The film starts with his humble beginnings, picking bales of cotton with his brother and parents in the fields and gradually depicts his path to show business, after his term in service in Germany and his job as a door-to-door salesman.  While already married and with a couple of children, he encounters the recently-divorced June Carter (brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon), of Carter Family singing fame (of whom he has been a great fan since childhood).  They are drawn to each other, and this mutual attraction intensifies as they embark on a musical tour together, along with a very young Jerry Lee Lewis.  This also takes a gritty look at Cash's descent into speed addiction and alcoholism and June's devotion to him during this, the darkest hour of his life.<br /><br />We hear some of Johnny Cash's greatest songs in this film (with vocals and accompanying instruments actually performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon).  These songs include "Folsom Prison Blues," "It Ain't Me, Babe" and "Walk the Line."  Joaquin Phoenix truly IS Johnny Cash, and you forget that he's even acting.  As for Reese Witherspoon, she earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actress, for her sensitive and beautiful performance as June Carter-Cash.  Their onscreen chemistry is sizzling and they are never hotter than when they are performing together onstage.  The whole film is a great example of cinema storytelling at its best--everything from the luscious cinematography to the great script is truly in a class by itself.

I thought this Johnny Cash dude was some rebel, troublemake, and a man in black that has bad intentions.  To look within this movie is to look within a man that I would of never guess him to be.  How through all the trouble he went through he survived.  "You're saying I don't believe in God?"  Didn't even know he did Gospel tunes! Johnny story is a great story of survival.  I even bought Gospel Road by Johnny Cash.  I must say that this is a man that I wasn't expecting.  He has great character and inspiring intentions.  Joaquin Phoenix did a great job!

Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself. A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances. "Hello....I'm Johnny Cash!!!!"</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>President Jimmy Carter said after seeing "Cold Miner's Daughter" that the movie was much better than he expected. The same could be said about this film and then some. These kinds of movies often fall flatter than a young bride's first baked biscuits. This one doesn't. Joaquin Phoenix ("Hotel Rwanda" and "Gladiator") is just about perfect as Johnny Cash. He resembles him both in appearance and in his voice-- he does all the Cash songs himself-- and Reese Witherspoon ("Legally Blonde" and "The Importance of Being Earnest") convinced me that she was June Carter. (She sings June's songs herself as well.) Witherspoon captures the essence of the character with both her humor and decency. (It is common knowledge that Cash gave June and her mother Maybelle Carter the major credit for his getting off drugs and turning his life around.)<br /><br />Some of the minor characters are miscast. Elvis Presley for one. With more Elvis impersonators now alive than ever before in history, it is inconceivable that a better Elvis couldn't have been found. On the other hand, some of the actors with cameo parts are quite wonderful: Mother Maybelle, Johnny's mother in middle age with her cat-eye glasses and Pentecostal hairdo and the bank teller who refuses to cash Cash's check, for instance.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes are those in which Phoenix sings. When he auditions for Sam Phillips at Sun Records, after trying a tired version of the then popular religious song "I Was There When It Happened," he breaks into a gritty, soulful version of "Folsom Prison Blues" worthy of the Man in Black, himself. The concert at Folsom Prison with June in the wings is electric as well; then there is the concert in Canada where Cash proposes to Carter before an enthusiastic audience that will make your eyes water.<br /><br />Director James Mangold ("Kate & Leopold" and "Girl, Interrupted") does an excellent job of keeping Carter and Cash's relationship from becoming too sentimental and also prevents the film from turning into a religious tract since Carter and Cash became devout Christians. (Only once does June say that God has given Johnny a second chance to make something of his life.) They are portrayed here as what they apparently were in real life, two less than perfect but decent, talented people who had one of the great contemporary love affairs that spanned almost forty years. Trite as it may sound, "Walk the Line" is ultimately about the enduring power of love. This is a film you will want to see again. The soundtrack is quite fine and stands on its own. Phoenix's talent as a singer is the biggest surprise of the movie. He and Witherspoon are likely Oscar contenders for their performances.<br /><br />Apparently Johnny Cash approved of having Mr. Phoenix play him in this movie. It is sad that neither he nor his wife lived to see this production. They would both have loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Walk The Line shows the legendary singer, Johnny Cash, during his impressive career. This movie will keep you entertained from start to finish and will only make you want to see it again and again, it's that good. With stars like Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon portraying Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter, this movie is filled with powerhouse performances.<br /><br />Walk The Line is unique and entertaining because it has all the singers actually sing their own songs instead of editing Cash's own voice into the movie. Reese Witherspoon took singing lessons and really shines in some music scenes as she sings for audiences in the movies. Pheonix shows he can sing too and gets the crowds going so well you can't help but tap your foot along with the music.<br /><br />The acting is great also, as every character adds their bit into the movie to make you feel as if you were witnessing Cash's life when he was still a young man. Some great scenes have him starting to sing for a record company and sing about his problems with the air force and his lifestyles.<br /><br />The movie starts off with Cash as a young man back in Arkansas who is noticed for his unique voice and how he sang about different topics that normally would create controversy and disbelief with people. His life takes a turn for stardom as he takes a tour around the country and meets up with June Carter, who he later starts a relationshp with.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon was absolutely wonderful as a young woman who was great to every fan who talked to her and went out of her way to start a conversation with anyone who asked for an autograph from her. She and Cash had a rocky relationship as they both fall for each other, become disgusted with each other as Cash's drug problem gets out of control, and eventually agree to marry one another in a great scene where Cash proposes on stage in a show in Canada.<br /><br />It's great seeing how Cash became famous for his singing, and we also see greats he is travelling with such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley. I also found the scenes with Cash dressing up all in black and his performance inside the prison the best scene of them all, with Cash taking his hat off to the inmates who have to drink horrid, brown looking water.<br /><br />This is one movie you need to see to understand how great it really is. Phoenix and Witherspoon are fantastic, the singing is wonderful, and the entertainment is off the charts.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />10 deleted scenes<br /><br />commentary by James Mangold, the co writer and director of the movie<br /><br />Plus More!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Walk the Line tells a biographical account of Johnny Cash's (Joaquin Phoenix) life up to the mid-point of his life.  However, it does not focus on his musical achievements during this time although they are a major part of his life.  Instead, the film efficiently displays the maturation of his character. In the process, the audience gets a poignant glimpse into the roots and soul of his music.  The film opens in Folsom Prison in 1968, as Johnny fingers a circle saw while thinking of his childhood.  In one long flashback, the film provides a uniquely inspiring and genuinely moving picture of his agonizing life and constant search for something better.<br /><br />[Potential Spoilers Ahead For Viewers Unaware of Johnny Cash's Life]<br /><br />Even though people are the sum of their experiences, there are defining moments that shape our character and persona. Johnny Cash had several defining moments that helped form his identity, which had the possibility to strengthen, or destroy him.  Walk the Line offers an opportunity for the audience to see how he responded on these moments.  It also displays the importance that other people have on an individual's existence, as Johnny would not have succeeded, or overcome his predicaments without the love and care of others.<br /><br />Johnny Cash's life was everything, but easy, to which his songs are a testament.  Early on Johnny suffered the loss of his older brother, a death his father blamed on him.  He had a love hate relationship with his father, as he continuously sought his father's love by trying to please him.  However, every attempt was met with a put down.  The absence of his supportive and encouraging older brother left a large rift in his life, as it also continued to haunt him with agonizing guilt.  Besides the guilt, Johnny had to endure emotional neglect and abuse from his father who projected his own shortcomings onto him, which did not only continue to foster guilt, but also poor self-esteem and more anxiety.<br /><br />In the small home, where Johnny grew up he could not escape his father's physical presence, but he sought emotional refuge in music.  The radio and his mother's soothing singing offered him in moments of unease a chance to escape in spirit and mind.  Eventually, he came of age to leave home and a not a day too late he joined the Air Force.  Johnny ended up stationed in Germany during the Korean War for which his father also ridiculed him, as he did not fight the war like other real men.  The cut downs did not cease in Johnny's adulthood.  His father upheld the same loveless relationship with Johnny.<br /><br />Being an outsider, Johnny did not really fit in the military lifestyle. Again, he sought refuge in music, as a cure to his solitude. He acquired a guitar and taught himself how to handle the instrument. Soon he began to write his own material reflecting on the environment around him while letting his feelings steer his pen and fingers over the guitar strings. It is in this cerebral state where Johnny discovered peace and joy, but it also began the sanctuary where Johnny could exorcise some of his personal demons.<br /><br />Despite Johnny beginning to feel freer through music, he still hampered his own growth by trying to please others such as a future father-in-law and his father.  For example, his marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), doomed from the beginning, displays his noble attempt to please others while in the process slowly killing the joy within him.  Not that Vivian was a bad person, but they were not right for each other as Johnny merely tried to make everyone else happy.  The desire to make others like him ran deep within Johnny, who acquired this personal trait in a young age by constantly trying to prove himself worthy of his father's affection.<br /><br />Thus, it is easy to see how Johnny fell in love with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in their first encounter.  The upbeat beauty had a wondrous voice and a great sense of humor that brought about laughter, which must have been something Johnny dearly must have lacked during his upbringing.  She did not judge him, but shared her willingness to appreciate him and his music. June made him feel alive, worthy, and free of judgment.  Yet, Johnny could not enter her life, as he was married and she has recently got out of a bad divorce.<br /><br />Despite the distance between Johnny and June, he continued to long for her.  With the years his affection only grew stronger, until he came to a crossroads of pain where he once again was forced to face his demons.  Alone, he sought alternative ways of tranquilizing the agony within through a heavy drug addiction, which began harmlessly while partying with the other great musicians such as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne).  The drugs affected him to the point where he no longer could interact or perform with others.<br /><br />The many experiences and life defining moments in Johnny's life show a scarred battling fighter trying to overcome his excruciating past with love and music.  The black outfit serves a fitting symbolical value to Johnny, as a reminder of his past transgressions.  It is also here that Johnny Cash's greatness rests, as he does not pretend to be someone else.  He sings about the daily struggles that many suffer.  It provides something that people can relate to, but also find that they are not alone.  Thus, before a performance when Johnny Cash said with his unique voice, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."  It convincingly echoed within each listener - his is one of us.<br /><br />There are several aspects of Walk the Line that make it a brilliant film.  First of all, James Mangold is the perfect director for the film, as his profound understanding of human psychology only seems to improve, which also heavily influenced his previous films Girl, Interrupted (1999) and Identity (2003).  Several of the actors provide solid performances, especially Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix in the leads.  However, the supporting cast also helps bring out the emotional qualities in the main characters.  One must naturally also include the music, which is superb throughout the film.  Ultimately, these and other aspects of the cinematic process deliver remarkable cinematic experiences that will not fade in memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>This Oscar winning movie is every bit as good as you may have heard. There isn't single wasted frame, and just about every performance is spot-on. But the movie belongs to its two leads. Joaquin Phoenix burns darkly as the young Johnny Cash. His immersion into the role of the troubled "Man In Black" matches that of Oscar Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman's in "Capote." Even more fascinating is how Phoenix took the time to learn Cash's vocal mannerisms and record the songs for the movie. While Phoenix lacks Cash's low register gruffness, he still convinces as a singer. It really helps in the concert sequences, especially at the climactic legendary Folsom Prison performance.<br /><br />The same can be said for Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, who continues to grow as an actress. As June Carter, she manages to blend warmth, spunk and humility as she lives a life that runs parallel to Cash's, even as Cash begins to fall victim to his demons. She comes to terms with Cash's ongoing advances, even as she keeps her distance from his drug addiction. And like Phoenix, she sang her parts for the soundtrack. The duet of "Jackson" will stop your clock...you'll pause to wonder if they are really singing or if they are miming to the original.<br /><br />The other singers in the cast are solid in their performances, but particular credit belongs to Waylon Malloy Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis, who plays The Killer as a mischief making imp with just a brief glimpse at his dark side. As Executive Music Producer, T-Bone Burnette does his usual remarkable job at keeping the soundtrack rootsy and authentic. There's great original songs included with Phoenix and Withersppoon's tracks, making sure that "Walk The Line" never loses that air of honesty. It cuts off when June agrees to marry Johnny in front of a live audience (essentially losing 35 years of story), but the one thing I can say to "Walk The Line's" benefit is that I didn't feel cheated. You'll come away from "Walk The Line" with a firm understanding of just why June and Johnny's marriage endured.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>The first thing that sticks out to me about this film is the audio. It's sharp, clear, excellent. If your not watching this on a decent home theatre system you are missing a whole lot.Viewing this I kept waiting for particuler events to happen that never played out. Ring of Fire was not presented as a true focalpoint of Johnny and June's relationship, just bits and pieces of another song being written. It wasn't even discussed between them in the film. Strange. Then they played it uneventfully. Mr. Phoenix had Cash's movements down well but I kept being distracted by predictability. The film is entertaining though and I learned a little more about times and places. Reese Witherspoon is finally playing a role made for her instead of those cheesy supposed comedy "films". Her acting had real believability and she was properly awarded. A Boy Named Sue was not used for the prison singing scenes and I'm not sure why. It was done there, has wide appeal, would capture a new audience and is just a wild song to have witnessed prisoner reaction to.<br /><br />  I wanted to see Johnny Cashes spiritual road expounded upon more but the film ended rather abruptly. The Elvis scenes seemed very forgetable and cheapish. I like Johnny Cash and their was a great deal to the man, but the movie came up missing that critical essence of a very changed deeper person. A trying effort by all though.</p></br></body></html>

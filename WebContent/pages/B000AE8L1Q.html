Kevin Costner is better as an ex-baseball star and radio jock who lives nearby and longs for stability. Binder himself, as Costner's producer, makes a believable jerk. They are the only reasons for watching this pointless and unpleasant picture. Between the subplot clutter and self-absorbed characters, there is nothing to admire and nobody to like. The surprise ending does not surprise and, in fact, aborts the film's premise.<br /><br />Directors usually try to cast actors who resemble siblings or a parent, but no effort was made here; the teenagers are attractive but disparate (and spend a lot of time in the kitchen.) Costner's umpteenth turn at bat is a two-base hit, charmingly fey. Allen, as resourceful and serious a stage and screen actress as we have, mostly acts drunk, uncaring and rude, as though booze excuses bad behavior. When we're finally asked to pity her, we don't. The actress confides in a disc extra that she really wanted to try comedy. I'm afraid that challenge still awaits her.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>the Problem with alot of films today is that they often try to be too much to everyone&miss the most important part:making any sense. Kevin Costner does a good job here. this film feels like about 3-4 films that i have seen over the past few years tied together.it gets heavy handed in spots&then shifts into more Humor.sometimes it can't make up it's mind what it wants to be.the story has moments though.</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>After her performance in "The Ice Storm" it is no surprise that Joan Allen could carry a movie like "The Upside of Anger". Nor was it a surprise that she and Alicia Witt could beautifully play off each other in their confrontational mother and daughter roles. What did surprise was that the film featured equally strong performances from the other members of the cast. Even writer/director Mike Binder does a fine "on-screen" job as a slimy but not entirely unsympathetic radio producer. Kevin Costner would be wise to stay with this type of role (and with comedy) instead of big-budget epic stuff.<br /><br />The casting of Witt with Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, and Keri Russell as the four sisters was inspired. All the subtle birth order distinctions felt right.  The oldest (Witt) was the most connected to mom even though it did not appear so on the surface.  The second (Christensen-who absolutely glows on the screen) was determined to be different than her older sister.  The third (Russell) was the most connected to the father, missed him the most, and had the least understanding of the mother.  The youngest (Wood) was way ahead of the curve and the most perceptive character in the film.<br /><br />Binder gave into the temptation to use cheesy special effect gimmicks several times (the explosion at the dinner table, the neighborhood transition from summer to winter, the ballet fantasy, and the daughters growing older during the funeral scene).  Although done well they seemed out of place.  Also Binder should review the Kent State shootings, there were four students killed-not six.<br /><br />There is a spectacular shot at the wedding.  Beginning as an over the shoulder shot of Hadley (Witt) sucking in her "plump" cheeks, the camera pans slightly right and moves toward the wedding party as the focus changes to bring them out of a blur.<br /><br />The film's ironic twist in the last 15 minutes is borrowed wholesale from "Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice".  I particularly liked Wood's beautiful narration which helped clarify the title and theme, necessary (or at least helpful) after this ironic story line twist. She manages to sound both detached and involved, probably because it is actually the voiceover from her broadcasting class project. When we are suddenly forced to reevaluate everything that has gone before in what we thought was just an interesting comedy, Wood steps in and steers us to internalize the theme.  They go out on a shot of Wood looking up from her Mac and smiling.  Amazing.<br /><br />This is the best of Binder's writing:  "Anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks.  That's what I know now.  It needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers.  It's real though, the fury, even when it isn't.  It can change you, turn you, mold you and shape you into something you're not.  The only upside of anger then, is the person you become, hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid of its journey.  Someone that knows that the truth is, at best, a partially told story.  That anger, like growth, comes in spurts and fits and in its wake leaves a new chance of acceptance and the promise of calm".<br /><br />"The Upside of Anger" is one of those rare films that I believe everyone should make an effort to connect with, doing so will make you a better person.  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>The Upside of Anger features Kevin Costner, as former baseball player or that is what we are supposed to assume. And this movie pairs him iwht Joan Allen who plays a dirvoced/single mom, of teenage girls, or girls that are in their early 20's. In the movie Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) who was a baseball player, but now is a radio show host, on WRIF, and is a neighbor to Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen), and her kids are Andy Wolfmeyer (Erika Christensen), Emily Wolfmeyer (Keri Russel), Hadley Wolfmeyer (Alicia Witt), Popeye Wolfmeyer (Evan Rachel Wood) and Grey Wolfmeyer (Danny Webb), who almost all live with them mom, she spends the day trying to raise the teens/adults, and Denny would talk about almsot everything on the show, expect for baseball, and he even gets one of the girls a job, working as a producer, and that would be Andy, and before you know it, she is hooked up to his producer, and a proucer of another show Shef (Mike Binder), even through her Momther doesn't approve of this, and what Mom would approve of her daughter going out with somebody that is way older then her daughter?</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>Despite great performances, this film is a dismal portrait of an unlikable character. We are told that Terry's husband has gone to Sweden with his secretary, and that for 3 years, never contacted his family (wife and 4 teenage to adult girls). We are told that Terry was "sweet" before this event, and has changed. What we see is a manipulative control freak with a bad drinking habit, and one must suspect that the seeds of this were always there.<br /><br />I find the biggest flaw is the basic premise of the film, which I can't mention because it would be a spoiler. I had a nagging feeling throughout the film that something didn't make sense, and in reflecting on the story after seeing the film, I realized that I had been duped, and that the very clever twist ending was a actually a silly one. There would have been too many unanswered questions for the plot to unfold as it does.<br /><br />Joan Allen is superb as Terry, but it is hard to have sympathy for her, even though she asks for compassion in her time of need. Kevin Costner is also excellent as Denny Davies, Terry's booze buddy turned lover, an ex-baseball star with a radio talk show, and a beer for breakfast type of guy. Yes, the liquor runs like a river in this film, but the dialogue is often weak, and many scenes seem unresolved. As the daughters, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Alicia Witt and Keri Russell all do their parts beautifully.<br /><br />"The Upside of Anger" was written and directed by Mike Binder, who also plays Shep, Denny's producer. Shep is a bit of a reprobate, but gives Terry an earful of truth at a wedding party, and has some of the best scenes in the film. The score by Alexander Desplat is lovely with some nostalgic songs included, like Neil Diamond's "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Now." DVD extras include deleted scenes, and commentary. Total running time is 118 minutes.<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILER:<br />We all have favorite things. Things we use daily and wouldn't like to live without. If I ever "disappeared," I would hope that the family I had been living with for nearly 2 decades would notice if for instance, my journal and favorite pen had not "disappeared" with me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Upside of Anger starring Joan Allen and Kevin Costner seemed like an interesting and funny film but this is one of the strangest films of 2005. The ending is completely ridiculous and comes from nowhere, Allen's character is so unlikable, I can't believe how narrissitic she comes off. Keri Russell and Evan Rachel Wood are the only two characters that have some depth and Costner isn't too bad as others have stated. This film starts off promising but ends up drowning in its own stupidity. Stay away from this absurd turkey.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Only another drunk would put up with the nasty attitude and cruel behavior of our "heroine".

It made me angry.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>A romantic comedy with the likes of Joan Allen and Kevin Costner should catch fire, shouldn't it?  So why is this "witty" and "poignant" character-driven film from writer/director/actor Mike Binder flat as a pancake?  Maybe because it's not witty nor poignant, but it seems to think it is.  The Upside of Anger trots out tired cliches--the bored and boozy suburban housewife, the middle-aged has-been trying to find himself (Costner stretching himself in another washed-up baseball player role), the daughters coming of age, dealing with sex and boyfriends and having runs-ins with mom every other day.  There doesn't seem to be a big point to it all--does Binder think he's telling us anything new?!?  There are also way too many cribs, or attempted cribs, from Terms of Endearment, including a sudden serious hospital illness, to make this seem like anything more than a tired conceit of a movie wallowing in pretention.  (Plus it just reminds you how fresh Terms of Endearment was in 1982.  But 2005 is not 1982.)  Allen, always natural and effortless, gets to strut her stuff as the middle-aged mom with a fondness for Grey Goose vodka; Costner is well-cast--he never displays much range but in the right role he fits like a comfortable old pair of shoes.  Binder gives himself a major role as a radio producer in a subplot that goes littlewhere and seems more like a vanity trip than an exploration of anything germaine to the movie.  The love interest of one daughter, Dane Christensen, has a pointless role, that climaxes puzzlingly when he smashes through a glass window while bungee-jumping from a tree (and if that makes little sense to you, it makes even less sense in the context of the film).  The four daughters themselves (Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood) are bland and interchangeable--maybe one daughter less and one subplot less would have given the movie more focus.  But even better would have been more unique situations and setups for the conflicts, which are as forseeable as an Iraq quadmire.  Too often in this movie mom just pops off on the typical things TV and movie moms pop off on all the time: mouthy children, the claustrophobia of suburbia, neighbors who want to get them between the sheets.  Although the film tries the patented James L. Brooks formula of lurching from hilarity to pathos in an eyeblink, here the quips aren't funny, the drama not fresh, the psychological underpinnings pedestrian.  We've seen it all before--on Desperate Housewives, for example, to which stylistically this movie bears more than a passing resemblance, especially when it comes to the undistinguished music score (amazingly, composed by Alexandre Desplat, who turned out far more unique and extraordinary work for the Nicole Kidman film Birth; this one he seems to have phoned in).<br /><br />Well, we've *almost* seen it all before.  At the very end there is a twist so unusual that I have to admit I was totally taken by surprise for once.  The official Amazon review calls it "wrongheaded," but I disagree: this oddball direction is just what the rest of the movie needed.  But is it worth waiting two hours for?  For me, the answer is definitely no.  Joan Allen, I love you, but better luck next time.<br /><br />The DVD looks great, with a near-perfect transfer.  There are commentaries and the obligatory "making of" documentary, but this film left me so bored that I cared about neither.  More tellingly, there's a trailer that has the life and snap and energy that the film itself desperately needed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie features Joan Allen as a woman whose husband has left her.  She drowns herself in booze and anger and leaves her four daughters in exasperated confusion as she flounders around trying to make sense of a new life without her husband.  As her daughters are going through important passages in their lives, she continues on her bitter way, showing little support for their hopes and dreams.  Her only solace is her next-door neighbor, a former professional baseball player (Kevin Costner) who offers her companionship and understanding.  The movie seems to have an identity crisis and has moments of comedy, drama, and darkness which alternate in no particular order and for no particular purpose.  I spent the first 3/4 of the movie trying to decide where it was going and the last part, marveling at the ill-advised twist at the end. The acting was good, but the writing and plot were not and the results were very unsatisfying for this viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>THE UPSIDE OF ANGER features this great, tour-de-force, hilarious performance from Joan Allen as a woman who becomes a pissed-off bitch when her husband disappears on her. She owns the movie completely, and, though she's often better than the film itself, it still manages to give her entertaining things to say and do.<br /><br />She spends the first half of the movie drunk out of her mind, saying the most preposterous, awful things. The teens behind us in the screening kept laughing their asses off, for Allen really was that funny.<br /><br />She maintains strong chemistry with Kevin Costner, who gives one of the best performances I've seen from him in years, and he gets some really funny moments. But the movie belongs completely to Allen. She's hilarious.<br /><br />Her best scene, maybe, involves her meeting with her eldest daughter's future in-laws, after being blindsided with the news of the engagement. As her character's composure completely deteriorates, Allen garners some big laughs, even though you also feel embarrassed for everyone in the scene with her.<br /><br />At another point, her character has become so well-established that she's able to generate laughs from a dismissive facial expression.<br /><br />The movie itself is weak. The direction from Mike Binder, who costars, isn't great. The screenplay has some great moments but too many weak ones. The daughters, played by Alicia Witt, Evan Rachel Wood, Erika Christiansen and Keri Russell, barely escape becoming cariacatures and spend the majority of the time reacting to Allen. Sometimes the movie drags, and the ending, once it gets there, feels like a cheat.<br /><br />It's another sad case of a great performance in a humdrum movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Upside Of Anger" is brilliant! Joan Allen is impressive in an Oscar-worthy peformance as Terry Wolfmeyer. Kevin Costner is just as impressive as well, as Denny Davies. The supporting cast, led by Mike Binder (who also wrote and directed the movie), is excellent. Binder's directing and screenplay are brilliant and well worth an Oscar nomination for next year. The music by Alexandre Desplat is excellent. The cinematography by Richard Greatrex is excellent. The film editing by Steve Edwards and Robin Sales is excellent. The casting by Danielle Roffe is excellent. The production design by Chris Roope is excellent. The art direction by Tim Stevenson is excellent. The set decoration by Neesh Ruben is excellent. The costume design by Deborah is excellent. This is an brilliantly executed film and it is also one of the year's best!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Mike Binder wrote and directed "The Upside of Anger," and also plays a somewhat-redeemable loser in the flick.  It's obvious that "TUOA" is a labor of love for Mr. Binder, but it's also obvious that he's in love with it a bit too much.  Virtually every writing instructor tells you that the hardest thing in writing is cutting a favorite character, subplot, or chapter in order to make the entire novel work.  Mr. Binder appears to have lacked that discipline on this project.<br /><br />And yet, "TUOA" succeeds more than it fails.  That success comes from three things - a generally funny script, and two pitch-perfect performances from Joan Allen and Kevin Costner.  Both actors are so true, so wrapped-up in their characters that we alternately acknowledge (in Allen's case) and concede (in Costner's) that these are two of the best actors working today.  (Maybe Costner should just act in movies that he doesn't direct . . .)<br /><br />Allen plays Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, mother of four gorgeous daughters -- one off at college and three in high school.  She lives in a huge McMansion that abuts some surprisingly dark woods.  But there is trouble in paradise (perhaps overly stated by the bar-like window frames everywhere in the house).  Terry's four daughters range from hating her to leaning that way, and Terry's husband (never seen) has apparently fled for Sweden with his nubile secretary.<br /><br />Enraged, Allen crawls inside Grey Goose vodka bottles, where she meets former baseball great Denny Davies (Costner), who lives nearby and hosts a local radio show where he talks about anything except baseball.  Denny, perpetually pleasantly buzzed on Budweiser (from a can), sees another soul in pain and begins one of the laziest, most drunken seductions ever seen on film.  But Terry sees the good in Denny, and she more or less tolerates his advances.<br /><br />Eventually, they become the booziest couple in film history since Nick and Nora Charles from the "Thin Man" movies.  Their relationship hits roadblocks and speedbumps, most notably when Denny does his version of Rhett Butler's "No lock's going to keep me out, Scarlett" rampage -- this is one of the movie's most entertaining scenes.  But through it all, Costner and Allen give Denny and Terry life and depth that is absent from so many other movies.  Watch as Costner nervously caresses his immminent bald spot when pressed into a corner, and watch how Allen shifts from defense-to-attack when challenged by a rebellious daughter.  Fine work.<br /><br />That said, "TUOA" is over-written and includes about five too many subplots.  The daughters get a few individual moments, but there's just not enough for them to do.  Binder gives a good performance as Denny's sleazy womanizing producer Shep, but the movie spends a lot of time crushing and redeeming Shep when he's really a minor player.  Binder also could have easily cut the exposition narrative from the younger daughter . . . cute teenagers only talk like this in movies.<br /><br />All in all, you can miss "TUOA" and you won't have missed much . . . except for two classic performances by two talented actors at the top of their game.  You'll get more than a few laughs out of it, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>THE UPSIDE OF ANGER has so much going for it:  a once-happily married housewife (Joan Allen) thrown into rage and despair when she's convinced her husband has left the country to be with his secretary; a washed-up, boozing, ex-baseball player (Kevin Costner) who is lonely and fears the emptiness of his life; and four teenage daughters, each one of them coping with the abrupt disappearance of their father while they embark on the problematic, often disappointing, experiences of teenage life.  Thus, the stage is set for a powerful, compelling, bittersweet film, yet THE UPSIDE OF ANGER misses the mark, and misses it badly.<br /><br />The weak link certainly doesn't exist within the actors.  Allen gives a gutsy, vindictive, manipulative, and heartfelt performance as broken-hearted Terry Wolfmeyer--a woman who drowns her sorrows with vodka and takes out her anger and rage on anyone and everyone around her.  Costner, who for years has been nothing more than a Hollywood afterthought, turns in a superb performance as former Detroil Tiger great Denny Davies, a friend of the Wolfmeyer family who finds himself drawn by Terry's pain, and ultimately becomes her soulmate.  Alicia Witt, Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, and Evan Rachel Wood are all very convincing (and often very funny) as the silent-suffering daughters.  The chemistry and interaction of the players--as they sit around the dinner table, as they quarrel, laugh, cry--is terrific and completely believable.<br /><br />So what's wrong?  The problem lies with writer/director Mike Binder (who also plays a sleazy radio producer in the film).  I felt like Binder was given the keys to a Lexus, but never taught how to drive it.  The movie, the scenes, the pacing, were all so uneven, even choppy, that I found myself losing complete interest in the story.  Even worse was the screenplay; it was hollow and superficial, and almost every scene came across as unorganized and ad libbed.  Much of the dialogue absolutely went nowhere, ending by an actor shaking his or her head and muttering, "Oh. . .never mind."  It was painful to watch; even more painful was the realization Binder squandered a golden opportunity to make an absolutely wonderful film.<br /><br />What salvaged this review from a two-star to a three-star rating was the ending; it came completely out of nowhere, and it was incredibly powerful and moving.  THE UPSIDE OF ANGER does have a tremendous upside--the acting.  Unfortunately, the downside--the pacing and writing--drags this movie down, way down.<br /><br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>This infuriatingly pointless movie features one of the most illogical surprise twist-endings I've ever had the misfortune of seeing.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but I will say it renders the movie nearly nonsensical.<br /><br />People have typed many a positive word about the cast's performances, and to be fair there is nothing particularly wrong with the acting.  But a good cast can't save a movie that has no idea what it actually wants to be about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Should anybody ever ask you the meaning of the idiom "tightly wound", you only need recommend THE UPSIDE OF ANGER as a visual explanation.<br /><br />Joan Allen stars as Terry Wolfmeyer, the middle-aged mother of four daughters precipitously abandoned by her husband, who's apparently run off to Scandinavia with his Swedish personal secretary. Terry internalizes her tremendous rage, and only just manages to control it with constant alcohol consumption. Her composure is further taxed by daughters Andy (Erika Christensen), "Popeye" (Evan Rachel Wood), Emily (Keri Russell), and Hadley (Alicia Witt) - all of whom are making life choices regarding love, sex, and education with which Mom vehemently disagrees. Circling the periphery of the Wolfmeyer household looking for a romantic opportunity with Terry is Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), an easy going but lonely ex-baseball star who subsists on beer and the money earned from autographing baseballs and hosting a radio talk show.<br /><br />Once again, Allen demonstrates that her acting ability is a national treasure. Is it too soon in the 2005 film season to mention Academy Award? And Costner, who's had his Big Screen ups and downs, hits it just right with Davies, a role perhaps suggesting a composite of the characters he played in BULL DURHAM and TIN CUP. The young actresses playing the daughters are all beautiful and delightful, though it stretched my credulity to believe that they were siblings. And I think that there was one sister too many. (As in the planting of garden trees, three is the "right" number.)<br /><br />It's enormously refreshing both to see a love story involving a man and woman, albeit boozy walking wounded, on the down slope of middle-age, and to see at work a talented actress (Allen), who, at least for this production, managed to crack the infamous age ceiling traditionally imposed on female leads. You go, girl!<br /><br />Anger, though caustic to the soul, can also keep one going during bad times. Here, when Terry's mental crutch is suddenly yanked away late in the film by a surprising discovery in the woods in back of her house, she must emotionally evolve, and do it fast or sanity is lost.<br /><br />For those viewers on the far side of forty, THE UPSIDE OF ANGER should prove to be an enormously engaging movie experience about relationships and inner salvation. While it won't, perhaps, prove to be the best film of 2005, it'll certainly be in the Top 20.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Terry Wolfmeyer was, in her daughter's words, the "sweetest, nicest, woman that anyone who knew her ever knew". That is, until her husband ran off with his secretary leaving her with 4 cheeky daughters, a lovely suburban Detroit home, and a lot of self-pity. "Then things changed. And she changed. She got angry. Good and angry." Terry (Joan Allen) turns herself into an embittered lush and has an affair with an equally drunk neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner). Denny's an affable, easy-going ex-pro baseball player who trades on his former glory to make a living. Terry is of the opposite temperament: controlling, intense, and self-important, so they make quite a pair. Preoccupied with her husband's rejection and using her victimhood to excuse all manner of outrageous behavior, Terry still finds time to be appalled by her eldest daughter Hadley's (Alicia Witt) marriage, her ballet dancer daughter Emily's (Keri Russell) choice of career, and other daughter Andy's (Erika Christensen) boyfriend. Only the youngest of the family, Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood), escapes her venom.<br /><br />The key to enjoying "The Upside of Anger" is to understand that it is a black comedy. The film's fault is that that is not obvious. The humor in Terry's behavior is clear, but it's always played straight, which sometimes makes it difficult to know if we are watching a comedy or a tragedy. The film's tone is inscrutable. It has a sense of humor, but at the same time is consumed by Terry's anger. Terry seems to have everything in the world except  a husband, whom she apparently didn't love anyway. Her life is remarkably unchanged by his abandonment. Yet she never ceases to feel sorry for herself, and she tries to keep such a tight reign on everyone around her that we feel she might crack. Terry is sympathetic only up to a point. Fortunately, writer/director Mike Binder sensed the limit of our sympathy and made the characters act accordingly.<br /><br />Even if we're unsure of how we should take Terry Wolfmeyer, this is one of Joan Allen's most memorable performances, and that's saying a lot. Terry is overbearing, seems to resent her daughters' happiness and successes, and goes out of her way to find something to criticize. But she is cognizant of her own foibles. She is also possessed of a fierce love for her children, even if they wish they saw more of the love and less of the fierce. All of the characters are self-aware and refreshingly forthright. Mike Binder has written a smart film with impressively sharp dialogue. -And he is fantastically funny in the role of Andie's lecherous older boyfriend Shep. Like Terry, Shep is a alternately sympathetic/repulsive/hilarious character who is, nonetheless, blunt and insightful no matter what he does. Denny Davies is Kevin Costner's best role in years, a tolerant, caring, slacker-ish neighbor who is brighter than he seems. Denny and Terry's boozy relationship is certainly entertaining and gives the film an element of romantic comedy. The audience can choose to take "The Upside of Anger" as seriously or as lightly as it wants. The film's greatest strength may be in the fact that it is simultaneously very funny and very true. But it's never dumb.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2005): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer, 8 deleted scenes, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), a making-of documentary, and an audio commentary. "Creating the Upside of Anger" (27 minutes) features interviews with the cast, producers, and writer/director/actor Mike Binder. Binder discusses writing the film for Joan Allen and getting it made. Actors discuss each other, characters, and filming. There is some information on Mike Binder's career. This documentary should have been edited down, but there is some interesting info. The audio commentary is by Mike Binder and Joan Allen, moderated by Rod Lurie. It starts off as a prolonged mutual admiration society but does eventually move on to discuss characters, themes, and talk a great deal about decisions in writing the film. Binder does at one point address the comedy-drama genre confusion. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>When her husband's secretary goes back to Sweden and then her husband disappears, Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) puts two and two together.  As far as Terry is concerned, her husband no longer exists and is dead to her and their four daughters.  At the start of "The Upside of Anger" Terry is not so much angry as she is drunk.  When next door neighbor and former baseball player Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) finds out about Terry's situation, both the news that her husband is gone and the fact that she is drinking all of the time, he walks into her house and into her life.  Denny's reasons for doing so are not clear.  He could just be looking for a new drinking partner, or he could be recognizing a person whose life has just crumbled beneath then.  Then again, maybe he just wants sex.  But when Terry decides she just wants sex, Denny flees, so we have to think there is more going on.<br /><br />The relationship between Terry and Denny is the main plotline of "The Upside of Anger," but in addition to the missing husband and deciding what is up with this new man suddenly in her life, Terry has to deal with four daughters.  Hadley (Alicia Witt) is about to graduate college and has a double-dose of news for her mother.  Andy (Erika Christensen) does not want to go to college and just wants to work, which is also news for Terry.  Emily (Keri Russell) is a dancer who wants to go to a small arts college, ideas that Terry disparages.  Then there is "Popeye" (Evan Rachel Wood), real name Lavender, who is the narrator of the film in those few instances where we cannot be told a profound thought any other way.  It is hard enough for Terry to deal with being an abandoned wife without her daughter's throwing an increasingly frustrating number of new monkey wrenches into her life as well.  Consequently, there are moments where the dialogue gives way to inarticulate grunts and a particular memorable death wish daydream at the family dining room table.<br /><br />I do not have a problem with the conclusion put together by writer-director Mike Binder ("The Sex Monster," "The Search for John Gissing").  Since I have the firm conviction that irony is the master trope of the universe, I appreciate the twist at the end of this one.  Furthermore, I think that it underscores the message of the film, a conclusion I reached before I did the extras on this DVD and found out precisely what Binder says is his thesis proposition.  Binder wrote the script specifically for Allen, so it is not surprising that her performance is on point, but Costner is equally as good in what is essentially a supporting role (his best moments are when he wins "Popeye" over and kicks down the bathroom door).  It is not surprising that the four young actresses basically jumped on board because they wanted to work with Joan Allen (clearly there is a big upside to doing so).<br /><br />My main complaint with this movie ends up being that it does not have enough deleted scenes.  Dealing with what is happening between Terry and Denny is enough without trying to provide equal time to all four of the daughters.  After all, it is not like this is adopted from a novel that you can go read after the fact to find out more about the characters.  Binder wrote a script and not a novel, so this is all there is and there ain't no more.  But I wish there was because it is the complexity of Terry's relationship with her daughters and how they all deal with Denny and the absent father.  "The Upside of Anger" feels like it has the depth of a novel, which is a pretty good compliment for a movie of this sort.<br /><br />Plus, you have to like any writer-director who writes a script in which his leading lady gets to slap him not only around but actually all the way down to the groud.  The fact that Binder filmed this story, set in a Detroit suburb, at the Ealing Studios in London, is also impressive.  Now the big question is whether the Academy will remember Joan Allen at Oscar time, because she should at least get a nomination out of this one (her performance is certainly better than all five of last year's nominees).</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Having grown up in a house of women, I can relate to the domestic set-up that director Mike Binder has concocted in his film, "The Upside of Anger."<br />Women have a special world all their own that few men have the opportunity to penetrate unless they've grown up around or spent most of their life with them: more to the point,listened intently to what women have to say and closely observed how they act and react to things.<br />As Denny (Kevin Costner) says when he has dinner with Terry Wolfmeyer (the radiant Joan Allen) and her four daughters (Kari Russell, Evan Wood, Alicia Wood and Erika Christensen): "I can't get over this....this is all so girly." And he isn't being negative, he is merely pointing out the obvious: women are different than men, and in this situation, because they feel comfortable in front of Denny, these ladies have let their guard down a bit and shown him a little of how the feminine mind operates.<br />Terry has lost a husband to another woman and she is not one bit happy about it. She is depressed, she is drinking too much, and she is turning inward and shutting out her four daughters: she is in mourning and she doesn't want sympathy, she wants revenge.<br />Joan Allen has never been more human and funny and her Terry Wolfmeyer is not above pettiness, pouting and acting like a horse's pattootie. She has been a good wife and an even better mother and she, rightly so, feels that she doesn't deserve this betrayal.<br />Costner here is so far removed from JFK and The Postman or any of his hero roles that he is almost unrecognizable: he's gutty, sloppy and he's always got a can of Bud in his hand. His Denny is someone who has never been without female companionship yet craves the warmth of a family. Think Jack Nicholson in "Terms of Endearment" with a big bleeding heart.<br />"The Upside of Anger" is too long by at least 10 minutes but nonetheless it is a warm, funny and thoughtful film. Savor its simple pleasures while you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>"The Upside of Anger" is a very good movie that is unfortunately going to be missed in the theatres by the larger audiences.  Directed by Mike Binder on a budget of a mere twelve million dollars (which is meager by the standard of today), "The Upside of Anger" is a film focusing on the character of Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) and her four daughters played by Alicia Witt, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell, and Erika Christenson.  At the start of the movie Terry is left by her husband (we never see him on screen) and is left quite bitter towards him.  She is also clearly something of an alcoholic.  Into her life walks Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), a former ballplayer who also hosts a local radio show but refuses to talk about baseball.  Denny and Terry have known each other for years, probably through her husband, but it seems like something changes when he finds out that Terry's husband left.  Denny starts coming around more often, but it isn't romantic.  Denny drinks too much, too, and they start out as drinking buddies washing their lives away.<br /><br />Terry's anger (and drinking) is driving her daughters away from her.  She says in the movie that she has one daughter that hates her and two or three who are on their way.  If Terry is driving the family apart, it is Denny that is holding them together.  At first he sort of imposed his way into staying for dinners, but midway through the movie it seems completely natural and the daughters are starting to really like Denny.  There is no easy path through the lives of this family, with the illness of one daughter and the anger of the mother, but Denny's good humor somehow keeps this movie from being too dark and gloomy.<br /><br />The role of Denny has to be one of Kevin Costner's best roles and best performances in years, possibly since 1996's "Tin Cup".  He has done some good work since then with "Thirteen Days" and "Open Range", but Denny feels like a signature Costner character with his easy charm and his easy laugh.  This is one of his more natural feeling performances and it is one of the reasons why, for a time, people really enjoyed going to a Kevin Costner movie.  But this isn't a Kevin Costner movie.  It's a great ensemble piece and if anything, it is a Joan Allen movie.  If this movie came out in October or November rather than April, there would likely be serious talk about Allen picking up a Best Actress nomination.  It would be warranted.  She plays the role here very well and doesn't take Terry too far past the line we would lose any sympathy for her.  Besides the two leads, all four women who play the daughters also do as good of a job as possible in their limited roles.<br /><br />In fact, the only negative that I can find is Mike Binder himself.  Not as a director, but as an actor.  Binder plays the role of Denny's radio producer Shep and Shep is an overly irritating, disgusting, piggish character.  Perhaps it is just about right because it gives more conflict to the family, but it just felt a little out of place and a little over the top.  But even that doesn't detract too much from the movie and I really loved this movie.  If I hadn't heard about this movie for several weeks I would call it one of those nice little discoveries a person finds at the movie theatre (or on DVD) from time to time.  It's quite good and I wouldn't be surprised if it holds up to be one of the better movies of the year.<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Mike Binder both wrote and directed this searingly important film; important for its concept, for its ensemble acting, and for performances by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner that are now the gold standard for the year by which all other award quality performances must be judged.<br /><br />Anger, and how it paralyzes our emotional outlook and alters our perception of reality and works to destroy those around us, is the harsh subject of this examination of a well-to-do family of husband, wife and four teenage daughters.  The story is narrated by the youngest daughter Lavender 'Popeye' Wolfmeyer (Evan Rachel Wood) and never were the words 'out of the mouth of babes' so pertinent.  The mother Terry (Joan Allen) is introduced drunk, constantly in her nightgown with glass of vodka in hand, and she pretty has spent her days in that manner since her husband Grey 'left her with his 22-year-old Swedish office girl' without a note, a call, or confrontation with his family.  Terry is consumed with anger, self pity, loathing, and barely manages to maintain a household, completely relying on her four daughters to cook, clean, shop, etc while she finds reasons to berate them for every act and motivation the girls show.  Hadley (Alicia Witt) is the oldest and enamored with a boy Terry considers a waste of time.  Andy (Erica Christensen) doesn't want to go to college but to become a reporter instead - a fact Terry refuses to consider.  Emily (Keri Russell) prefers to follow her dream of becoming a ballet dancer and attending an Arts College that, of course, Terry refuses to allow.  Popeye, the youngest, is hungry for belonging and wants desperately to be noticed by not only her mother but by boys, etc.<br /><br />A neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) is an alcoholic ex-baseball hero who now has a cheesy but popular radio talk show produced by his buddy Shep (Mike Binder, yes, the writer/director!). Denny has been friends of the Wolfmeyers for years and shows up drunk, warmly offering himself as a drinking partner to Terry.  The two spend their time drinking and watching television and watching the daughters each arrive at crises: Hadley gets pregnant and announces her engagement to Terry after everyone else knows: rage from Terry and an embarrassing scene at Hadley's announcement dinner.  Andy gets a job at Denny's radio show only to fall into bed with the lothario Shep: rage and a public fight from Terry.  Emily somaticizes her career frustration and ends up in a hospital with an ulcer: self-pity and depression from Terry.  Denny slowly works his way into Terry's bed and become a surrogate father/lover to these five father/husband-deserted women.  The ending is a shocker and cannot be revealed because it would destroy the fine story line of the film.  But it begins as it ends and that is the part that leaves the audience aghast that they didn't suspect that turn of event.<br /><br />Binder's script and direction achieve the impossible: he is able to create a family in disarray, deal with every aspect of anger, desertion, family ties, mother/daughter love (though severely tested), the needs of the 'victim' and how they can be tended.  Amazingly he does this with a large does of comedy, acerbic dialogue, restrained responses, and a keen grasp of reality that makes this a film about a tough subject one that is engrossing and never off-putting.<br /><br />The entire cast is pitch perfect: each of the actors who portray the daughters is exceptional.  But the brilliance that radiates from the screen is the triumphant performance by Joan Allen.  She inhabits Terry and despite the fact that she has every reason to make us loathe her character, she manages to keep her portrayal so sensitively nuanced that we stay close to her in this journey.  She is simply amazing in her body language, her understanding of alcoholic behavior patterns, and her internalization of her needs at the expense of her ever-surfacing rage.  Much the same can be said for Kevin Costner who gives the finest performance of his career in a role that could be pathetic and negative in the hands of a less capable actor.  His comedic talents shine, but not at the expense of his enormous sensitivity to the five women with whom he ends up living.<br /><br />Alexandre Desplat has once again created a movie score that has perfectly beautiful passages of music while always underlining the story appropriately. The cinematography by Richard Greatrex finds the perfect vantages that seem like windows in the hearts of each of the participants in the story.  Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Grady Harp, April 05</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Joan Allen's riveting yet restrained performance lends a big assist to this dramedy about social and subruban manners circa 2005. Allen plays protagonist to Kevin Costner's antagonist in this film about divorce, bitterness, alcoholism, readjusted family life and, finally, great surprise.<br /><br />Allen plays affluent suburbanite Terry Wolfmeyer who takes to drinking and bitterness when her husband leaves home, seemingly on a permanent basis, for what she thinks is his secretary. She soons develops a friendship with neighobr Denny Davies (Kostner), a washed up old ball player) who likes to drink and has a radio talk show in Detroit. Their friendship moves in a predicatble direction that keeps the plot from being as interesting as Allen's wonderful performance.<br /><br />The film is greatly abetted by actresses playing Allen's four daughters -- Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, Erika Christensen and Evan Rachel Wood -- two of whom are out of high school and two still carrying out late adolescence. The girls' lives are also very interesting and help the viewer stay connected with the enveloping emotions of the film.<br /><br />This movie won no awards but was more interesting and rewarding than a lot of Oscar winning and nominated flicks I've seen in recent years. There is affect from "American Beauty", "Ordinary People" and "Terms of Endearment", Oscar winners to which this film readily compares. It is also more interesting and less cliche-ridden than either "Mystic River" or "Sideways".<br /><br />I think this movie would have interest for just about anyone that likes watching great multilayered acting, beautiful people, subtle comedy and/or contemporary American drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Writer/Director/Actor Mike Binder has crafted a smart, witty, and emotional film with "The Upside of Anger." Joan Allen shines as Terry Wolfmeyer in a part written especially for her. Kevin Costner is superb as Denny Davies, an ex-baseball player (does he portray anyone else?), turned radio VJ. Kerri Russell, Evan Rachel Wood, Alicia Witt, and Erika Christensen are all perfectly cast as Terry's gorgeous daughters.<br /><br />The script was wonderful with its perfect blend of comedy and sadness. These were real people experiencing the trials and tribulations of everyday life in an accurate portrait of suburbia. This is definitely not a studio film that portrays the perfect people living in a  perfect world. It is a terrific portrait of a real American family told through biting comedy and drama.<br /><br />I liked these characters because they were not designed to be likable -- or, more precisely, because they were likable in spite of being exasperating, unorganized, self-destructive and impervious to good advice. That would be true of most people I know, including myself, so I appreciated them.<br /><br />Despite a few minor `holes,' this was a a wonderfully made comedy of domestic manners and quite possibly one of the best films of the year. Many people walked out of the theatre, so it is not for all tastes, but those who appreciate a great script and some fine acting should it a chance. I will never forget this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>Sink down into the seat at your local theatre and savor this one, which has a story that actually seems to end all too soon, even though it isn't a short movie.<br /><br />  Joan Allen plays a woman left in charge of her daughters when her husband takes off. She doesn't handle this too well, sinking into a daze fueled by alcohol and rage. That's when her neighbor (Kevin Costner) comes in, perhaps in his best role in years. He is absolutely perfect as a man with more than a few problems himself...but the chemistry between him and Allen is undeniable and it makes for a witty, touching and very watchable movie. Even better, it isn't predictable and I sat there wanting to know even more about these people after the film ended. This is one I plan to see again - and maybe even yet again after that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR.html">A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR</a><br/><p>I am a fan of Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Their acting was great in this movie, however, the plot and and the material they had to work with was lacking. Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) has four daughters and when her husband disappears, evidentally running off with his young secretary, she becomes bitter, angry, and unbearably controlling of her daughters. Her husband's friend, Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) is a former baseball player and current radio personality. What just does not make sense is how Denny so easily works his way into Terry's life when Terry is so shattered by her husband's evident betrayal. It doesn't ring true. They start off as drinking buddies and quickly move into a romance. Denny makes some moves on Terry, such as sneaking into the bathroom while Terry is in the shower, which would never further a possible relationship. In real life, some of Denny's audatious behavior would lead to a restraining order against a character such as Denny. In the script, such behavior (albeit well acted by Costner) is not believable.<br /><br />To make this movie even more incomprehensible, Terry, her daughters, Denny and everyone else involved have misconceptions about Terry's husband. We have no clue as to how these misconceptions arose. It just isn't explained in any way. Each of Terry's four daughters is involved in her own subplot, giving Terry the opportunity to try to manipulate each one's life. Allen does a great job in playing the role of this angry, maniplative mother but, these subplots don't congeal due to a mediocre screen play. The writer & director, Mike Binder has a supporting role as Denny's low life producer and he does a fine acting job but his screen play and direction are lacking. Despite very good acting jobs, this movie receives only a lukewarm 3 star recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Mike Binder wrote, directed and is a suport actor in this fun movie about anger. It stars Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. The entire ensemble cast of this movie were great in making this movie flow.<br /><br />The movie follows the journey of a wife and mother whose husband unexpectedly disappears and leaves them alone. Now the family has to learn to deal with the anger of his not being there. The family has four daughters and they need to juggle their mom's romantic dilemmas and family dynamics that continually change. Kevin Costner plays a former baseball player, now radio DJ, who starts to fall for the family.<br /><br />The true story of the movie is about anger. How it can stop and change your life if you let it. And even though the female lead is angry, she is dealing with a tough time in her life. But most of all the movie shows that anger is a waste of time and that you should not make assumptions. Always check your facts first.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>I went to the movie theatre expecting a good film and became mesmerized.  I went back again with my daughter for a second time and now have the DVD.  My jaw drops with HOW good this movie is.  Director Mike Binder who was in "Minority Report" as an actor and who wrote the screenplay does an amazing job with the dialogue.  It's framed by some very literate narration from the young daughter Popeye played by Evan Rachel Wood from TV's "Once & Again" series.<br /><br />Joan Allen's performance is brilliant.  She is so angry and depressed and achieves such comedy that it's amazing she didn't walk away with a gold statuette at the Oscars.  She is so self-absorbed and delights in it so that everyone around her must pay attention.  When she goes to meet daughter Hadley's new in-laws she downs Bloody Marys like they were Pepsi-Colas and says, "Well, at least you're not Jewish."  It's the quintessential inappropriate remark and later causes her to describe herself as the poster child for alcohol prevention.  The costumer who puts her in the flowing nightgowns in the bedroom as she rips her husband's clothes out of the closet and his pictures off the wall is brilliant.  While most of the film's expressionistic flourishes fell on the cutting room floor in the deleted scenes, the one brilliant moment is when Shep slurps soup and his head suddenly explodes.  The deleted scenes show a fantasy sequence where Joan Allen's Terry has murdered her husband and his cheating partner and the bloody husband's corpse comes back to complain.  Terry looks at him with one of those icy stares and then punches his bloody hacked head.  It is hysterical!<br /><br />Her comedy plays off of a brilliant Kevin Costner performance as a former baseball star who seeks a life after baseball.  His giddy little expressions as he intrudes on her shower and offers her a drink are priceless.  After he makes love, he lays back and looks like the happiest man on the planet.<br /><br />The supporting actors are excellent.  In addition to Wood as Popeye, TV's Felicity, Keri Russell, plays Emily who longs to dance, but who the mother shuts down as being unrealistic.  Her illness and Terry's rushing to her side show even more levels of caring, tenderness, and gives the mother character a perspective on her own difficulties.  Erika Christensen from "Swimfan" and "Flight Plan" does an excellent job as Andy who doesn't want to go to college and gets a job as a production assistant at the radio station.  Her affair with middle-aged Shep is hilarious, especially when Terry discovers them in bed and is so furious words will not even form on her lips over the intense rage she feels.  Alicia Witt who was in "Vanilla Sky" plays the older daughter Hadley who marries and has several babies in the course of the film.  Dane Christensen plays Popeye's friend Gordon who she hits on, only to find out he's gay.  His bungi-jumping scene through their plate glass window is hysterical for the nonverbal reactions from Joan Allen.<br /><br />I also found the theme of the movie to be profound.  Anger is an emotion that many experience.  Controlling it, channeling it and focusing in ways that don't hurt those around us is an important lesson that some never learn.  As an actress, Joan Allen expresses her rage so exquisitely that we both laugh & cry.  This will be a film I will pull out from time to time as one of my all-time favorites.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>The best thing about The Upside of Anger isn't the script or the direction, it's the impeccable performance by one of Hollywood's most serious actresses, Joan Allen. She simply is the reason to watch this irresistably funny dramedy. She carried this movie by showcasing her very best just like Annette Bening did in Being Julia. Kevin Costner is very funny and charming as Allen's romantic interest, and he did managed to put out the fire in her.<br /><br />Joan Allen played a middle-aged housewife with four daughters aged from teen to early twenties, and she learned or suspected that her husband had abandoned her and ran off with his Swedish secretary. She was devastated and naturally lost herself emotionally, and became very Angry at people. If something goes wrong, she'd lose her temper. Her relationships with her girls are rather volatile, and her only salvation was Vodka on the rocks with a lime wedge. She's seen drinking almost every scene for more than the first hour of the film. She no longer have any real feelings or respect for others as she became increasingly drunk, resentful, and angry. Then entered Kevin Costner, a former baseball-pro turned radio show host, was the one to turn things around for her.<br /><br />Well, it wasn't easy at first to please this angry woman. He was the only man who dared to get involved with her and it took some time for her to warm up to the idea of possible new love. Meanwhile, not managing her own temper, she's faced with responsibilities of her rebellious daughters who are driving her to the point of near nervous breakdown. She soon learned that it's not good trying to control others when she couldn't even control herself, and she must change and make amends before everyone walks out on her.....<br /><br />I enjoyed Joan Allen a great deal in Pleasantville, and this is her best work in recent years. It's obvious that the role is tailored made for her. She excels through moments of wit, anger, shock, and heartbreak. She stood out completely in the group scenes and generated a ton of laughs when she makes an @#$! of herself in even a formal situation. Those eyes with so much fire and judgemental towards other characters is so memorable to look at. Anyone with a mother like her will be guaranteed non-stop laughs.<br /><br />Kevin Costner did a great job playing a role that's kind of a spinoffs of his past baseball player roles. There was plenty of chemistry between Allen and him. The scene when he got into a fight with her after she declined on marriage proposal was great. He told her that he refused to be her bitch in their relationship, so it shows that she was the dominant force.<br /><br />The young and beautiful daughters are pretty good, and I think Erika Kristensen was more outstanding.<br /><br />Overall, the film  succeeds as a good family dramedy, but I was not pleased with the unexpected ending. It seemed like it was written that way so that Allen could have a heavy duty scene to display a breakdown.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Joan Allan and Kevin Costner don't just act in The Upside of Anger, the absolutely sensational new melodrama from writer-director Mike Bender. They completely inhabit their respective characters, in two performances that will easily remembered as the best of the year.  Oscar nominations will be well deserved for both. This is a profound, funny, sad, and totally heartwarming film that is all about the way resentment and bitterness can turn us into monsters and prevent us from just getting on with our lives.  But the movie is also about the enduring resilience of love in the face of seemingly incongruent and competing odds.<br /><br />Joan Allen stars Terry Wolfmeyer, a woman, who living a palatial life in a ritzy suburb of Detroit, is suddenly - and seemingly inexplicably jilted and abandoned by her husband. Full of bitterness, she rages through life like a modern-day Medea, drowning her sorrows and calming her rage in a steady diet of vodka tonics. Her days resemble a drunken haze as she takes out her anger and resentment on her four teenager daughters: Hadley (Alicia Witt), Emily (Keri Russell), Andy (Erika Christensen), and Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood).<br /><br />When her affable neighbour Denny Davies (a terrific Kevin Costner) pops over for a visit, Terry, being her usual gruff self tells him to get lost. But the persistent Denny sees a drinking buddy in Terry, and he manages, with a mixture of drafty resilience and genuine affection - to weasel his way into her life, and the lives of her daughters. Denny is a washed-up champion baseball player, and part time local disc jockey and makes a meager living by cashing in on his once famous name. These days he spends much of his time getting drunk and stoned, so with beer can and improper chuckle in tow, he welcomes the opportunity to plop himself unceremoniously onto the sofa, stay for dinner, and just hang out until he becomes a fixture in the Wolfmeyer household.<br /><br />Of course, one thing leads to another, and Denny and Terry fall into an uncertain affair. She is complex, bitter and difficult, while he is affable, likable and a calming force to her tempestuousness.  Along the way we see Terry try to forge an often problematic and uneasy relationship with her daughters and their reaction to her is often an anxious mixture of support and disgust at her drunken, self-absorbed ways. They run the household - from cooking dinner, to making their own school lunches, while Terry hangs out drinking and sparring with Denny.<br /><br />Kudos must certainly go to Allan and Costner who have created marvelous portraits of two middle-aged drunks wrestling with life's pain and regret. Both are self-confessed alcoholics, and while their drinking brings them together, it also forces them to confront some unpleasant truths about themselves and the way they are running their lives.  The supporting cast also turns in realistic, nuanced performances, especially Binder himself as Shep, Denny's show producer and sidekick.  Shep is another mess of unappealing contradictions who seduces young Andy and instills in us  - and in Terry - a mixture of disgust and admiration at his shallow honesty.<br /><br />But the film mostly belongs to Joan Allen. Her portrayal of a woman who just won't place nice, who readily berates and yet loves her daughters, and clenches her neck muscles in mixture of resentment and vulnerability - is one of the great moments of screen acting. She has a fierceness and a severity that is almost exhilarating and it's easy to see why Denny steadily becomes attracted to her. Whether she is hurriedly gulping down a drink so that she can cope with Hadley's graduation, or icily criticizing Emily for not going to the "appropriate" arts college, she is a character that one is not likely to forget anytime soon. Mike Leonard March 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Joan Allen has one of her juiciest roles to date in "The Upside of Anger," playing the neurotic mother of four daughters whose life is shattered when her husband leaves her for another woman.  Like Aurora Greenway in "Terms of Endearment," Terry seems to have been put on this earth to drive her children crazy.  Yet, Terry also has reserves of strength, wisdom and common sense that can come into play when she isn't downing a pint of whiskey or trying to run the lives of everyone around her.<br /><br />"The Upside of Anger," though it deals with serious issues of abandonment and resentment (and anger, of course), is, essentially, a warmhearted comedy that has some wise and witty things to say about the complexities of mother-daughter relationships.  Terry has high expectations for each of her girls, so, naturally, she is a bit disconcerted when one of them chooses not to go to college and another hides the fact that she is pregnant and engaged to a man Terry has never even heard of let alone met.  The screenplay by writer/director Mike Binder explores the tensions between Terry and her various daughters without ever becoming trite and predictable along the way.  It's true that there could have been a bit more differentiation in the character of the four sisters; sometimes it's a little hard to tell who is who or what each of their particular goals or motivations are.  But that's a minor complaint when the movie, as a whole, is so insightful and witty about so many aspects of life.<br /><br />Conjuring up memories of "Field of Dreams" and "Bull Durham," Kevin Costner returns to form in a low-keyed, understated performance as Denny, an ex pro-ball player and neighbor who develops romantic feelings for Terry.  A fellow alcoholic, he manages to bring his own share of complications and baggage into Terry's already stressful life.  (Denny serves a function very similar to the one provided by Jack Nicholson in "Terms of Endearment").<br /><br />As fine as the other actresses portraying her daughters are, this is clearly Allen's film (and she has never looked as beautiful as she does here).  She brilliantly conveys the many moods of a conflicted woman without ever once going over the edge or stepping out of character.  She sinks her teeth into the role and never lets go.  It's a virtuoso performance from one of the finest screen actresses of our time.<br /><br />The film ducks more than one potential "chick flick" clich&eacute; in its search for the truth (even avoiding what would have been a major and truly disastrous parallel to "Terms of Endearment").  The movie itself could have used a little more clarification at times, but Allen's glowing performance makes the whole thing worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>I thought The Upside of Anger was a great film. Terry (Joan Allen) discovers that her husband has left her, presumably to run off to Sweden with his young secretary. In response, she goes on a boozy, angry binge and gets in touch with her inner bitch. Denny (Kevin Costner), Terry's neighbor and a washed-up baseball star, is only too happy to join in the alcohol-soaked pity party, and the two misery-loving drinking buddies find themselves drawn to one another. Costner and Allen were both amazing in this movie. I must admit, I had almost written Costner off after I saw several of his movies that did nothing for me. But in The Upside of Anger, he proves that he's still got it. Allen, who can sometimes come off on screen as a bit too repressed and buttoned up (a quality that made her perfect in Pleasantville), really lets loose here.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the director didn't throw away the roles of Terry's dughters on actresses who weren't up to the challenge. Erika Christensen, Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, and Evan Rachel Wood all turn in strong performances. The movie seems to explore both love and anger, with some interesting conclusions drawn via the character of Popeye (don't ask me where they got the name), one of Terry's daughters. (Popeye is played by Evan Rachel Wood, who blew me away a few years back in Thirteen.)</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>I guess there are times you don't read the reviews in the paper, don't see any theatrical trailers, and don't hear ANYTHING.<br /><br />When this film showed up, it must have been one of those times.<br /><br />This is a great film, full of comedy and tragedy, great acting, unpredictable plot twists, sleezeballs, heroes, and more.  Joan Allen and Kevin Costner are great in this as a couple of drunken neighbors looking for comfort.  Director Mike Binder, who also plays the sleezeball, puts together a story of tremendous "watchability."  It's hypnotic... you can't keep yourself from wanting to know what happens next.

One would think that a movie about a middle aged woman, bitter and boozed up up over the sudden disappearance of her cheating husband; and doing her best to raise her 4 adult daughters would scream "chick flick" and make for 2hrs of terribly unfunny male bashing.<br /><br />Instead.. what we get is a remarkably honest and relate able performance by Joan Allen. Her Terry Wolfmeyer is quite a character indeed. Terry is mad. MAD, MAD, MAD! After her hubby all but abandons her and her family, Terry whiles away the days watching TV with a smoke in one hand and a drink in the other. She's sarcastic to everyone she comes in contact with and is pretty much fed up with the suburban "American Dream".<br /><br />Enter neighbor Denny Davies, a ex baseball playing, pot smoking, beer guzzling radio talk show host - who after hearing about Terry's predicament- decides to become her new neighborly drinking buddy. He doesn't seem to mind Terry's moodiness and although she initially pushes him away- she tends to grow fond of his company.<br /><br />Of course, the two grow closer and closer until you can only guess what's developing....but the movie ends with a slight twist that this reviewer was not to particularly fond with.<br /><br />Ending aside however, the "Upside of Anger" is quite an entertaining and well acted piece of work. Having never, never, NEVER, been a Kevin Costner fan- this reviewer was immediately taken with his performance of Denny Davies. Costner shines in his supporting role fantastically. This is definitely some of his best work in years, if not ever. His strong presence helps "The Upside of Anger" become a movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />There's a lot more to "The Upside of Anger" than what I've just mentioned above. Interesting sub plots with Terry's daughters and one of Denny's co-workers helps the film come full circle.<br /><br />Recommended!!</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Apparently, I liked this more than most. Joan Allen and Kevin Costner were so in touch with the material that the 4 young starlets as her daughters were a little left out of the picture. Still, Ms. Allen was amazing in a complex characterization that left me exhausted. The hurt, confusion and anger were well displayed. Costner won a few awards for his performance, a presence that was at once cute and clever, as well as deeply concerned. Writer/director Mike Binder also filled the role of Costner's sleazy producer with vigor. Many have said that the four young ladies (daughters) were superficial, which may be a bit true, but this film was about Joan. Her daughters weren't very nice to her when she needed them most. The last film I can remember where 4 ingenues were thrown at you at once was "Mona Lisa Smile", but it was a different type of story, giving each a definite agenda. Binder created moments that almost looked like they were in fast-forward, showing Ms Allen's perception. That was clever. Once again, this is Ms Allen's film. My attention didn't stray much from her issues at hand. Though her daughters created some added angst, I was more concerned with how Ms Allen dealt with that angst. It's a really tough role, and she has no end of my admiration.  The clever, rapid-fire dialogue was reminiscent of the best of Billy Wilder or Preston Sturges. I'm sorry I found more to enjoy than many others, but am glad I got to experience this unusual and enjoyable romp.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>The movie has a star-studded cast, but no one competes for the space on screen. The script is smartly handled. The movie also handles the change of seasons, to show the passing time, very well. It brings a good point about anger and about knowing all sides of the story. I agree that the truth is only every partially correct. This movie made me miss quite a few people I haven't spoken with in a while and wonder about lost ties and misunderstandings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie if only for Joan Allen's portrayal of a bitter blooming-alcoholic living in the 'burbs with 4 beautiful daughters around 15 to 21. Kevin plays a retired baseball player now DJ (for WRIF-FM, the station I listened to often in Detroit when I was in my late teens and early '20s). He too drinks way too much. They find solace in each other.<br /><br />I loved watching Joan Allen and the movie does have a good script. I liked all the major characters in it except one. All but the detestable middle age guy. He only goes out with young women is made to be the guy you love to hate.<br /><br />I think most women over 40 will like this movie. I highly recommend it to them and anyone who enjoys films about relationships.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>A middle aged woman (Joan Allen) with four daughters thinks her husband has run off with his Swedish secretary.

He's a retired, alcoholic, baseball player with his own demons and quirks, like having a supply of baseballs in storage for when he's in the mood to autograph.

Joan's voice is quite threatening but he takes everything she says with a grain of salt and lets her have her space.<br /><br />This movie is surprising funny with a few touching moments. Joan Allen plays a vicious character. Her and Kevin have an enjoyable and believable chemistry. There was a fantasy scene where Joan thinks about someone's head exploding that seemed more like a regression into an Alley McBeal episode but overall it's an enjoyable film with more than one surprise in its storyline. It's not just another chick flick. Review written by M. E. Wood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) is on a bender. Her husband of many years has recently left her, for his Swedish secretary, and she isn't coping well. Her four daughters, Hadley (Alicia Witt), Emily (Keri Russell), Andy (Erika Christensen) and Lavender (Evan Rachel Wood) regard their boozing mother with bemusement as she lashes out at them. She doesn't even give them an opportunity to consider the loss of their father, she does it for them. Sitting in the dark, drinking Vodka, Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), an ex-baseball superstar for the Detroit Tigers and a current radio talk show host, stops by, carrying a Bud. He offers to sit and drink with her. So begins their relationship. Over the course of the next few years, Terry and Denny begin a relationship and help each other deal with the complexities of their lives and her daughter's lives.<br /><br />"The Upside of Anger", featuring a terrific performance by Joan Allen, and Kevin Costner's best performance in years, is easily one of the most poorly marketed films in recent history. The ads, featuring the two or three funny moments in the film, are misleading. This film is about a family dealing with a missing father and the various complications of life. If anything, "Upside" is a drama and should be marketed as such.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" was originally scheduled to be released in the spring of this year. When the Warner Bros. people saw the film, they loved it so much they moved it up to December, 2004, making it eligible for Oscar consideration. Too bad they didn't do that with "Upside". Joan Allen's performance would have earned her a nomination as well. Yes, the Best Actress category was weak last year, but even in a strong field, Allen's performance is powerful and believable.<br /><br />Terry Wolfmeyer isn't an easy person to like. Yes, her husband just walked out on her, but she lives in an alcohol fog, taking out her frustrations on her daughters. The young women take it in stride, because they are used to it. They laugh about it behind her back and she doesn't notice. All the time. When she does, Terry becomes an uncontrollable beast. The performance is remarkable because Allen changes the character in subtle stages. As she grows closer to Denny, she mellows a little, but she still has her tantrums, most of which are caused by the choices her daughters make. Throughout the film, Allen brings her character back to life. Throughout, we get the sense that Terry is unhappy with the path that her life is taking, but manages because she has responsibility and also because she finds happiness in her family. She doesn't ever truly seem happy, but she seems less angry.<br /><br />I haven't been a fan of Kevin Costner's for many years now. After "Dances With Wolves" he went on a self-indulgent streak, making films like "Wyatt Earp" (I'll never get those three hours of my life back! It seemed like twelve!), "Waterworld" and "The Postman"; over-long epics designed to show what a great star he was and little else. In "Upside", he plays a character who could be the older version of the character Costner played in "Bull Durham', but at a different point in his life. It's also interesting to watch Costner play a character that isn't necessarily a hero or the center of the film. Denny has been a hero for the hometown sports team, but now that age is catching up on him, he eeks out a living signing baseballs, attending shopping mall openings, drinking a lot of alcohol and hosting a radio show. He is burned out on baseball and won't even talk about it on his show, angering viewers. Initially, he finds a kindred spirit in Terry, someone who will keep him company as he drinks, to stem the tide of loneliness. He gloms onto the family and becomes a member before they know what has happened. Soon, the daughters are asking him if he is going to stay, so they can set a place at the table. He quickly becomes a confident to Terry and helps her deal with some of her problems. The performance is interesting because he helps to balance Terry's character. As Terry becomes more balanced, Denny fades into the background, supporting her. You don't often see a star take on a role like this. Costner does a good job with it, balancing Allen's work well.<br /><br />The story is familiar. None of the problems Terry's daughters encounter will seem new or fresh, but they are handled with a subtle grace that you don't often see. These same story ideas could quickly degenerate into the stuff of television soap operas (and comes close more than once) but the depth of Allen's performance brings it back to a more acceptable reality.<br /><br />The film is also set in an apparently affluent suburb of Detroit. The lush trees and brick walls seem to make the world even more insular. In this way, the film clearly sets it apart from the world at large. Many people go through these same issues, but these people, in this community, deal with it in this way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>There's a neat story behind this movie:  Mike Binder and Joan Allen met a few years back when Binder played Allen's Chief of Staff in "The Contender."  Allen knew Binder had writing chops and said, basically, 'Hey, Mike, if you write a good script, keep me in mind.'  Which is what happened here: not only did he keep her in mind, he built the whole movie around her.  And, she delivers the goods.<br /><br />I've always respected Joan Allen's work, but she takes it a few notches higher here with some mind-blowing acting.  And, more than a few guys are going to watch the movie and say: whoo, she's a lot sexier than I ever realized.  And funnier, too.<br /><br />But - don't trust the rather light and airy trailer.  This movie is quite a bit darker than the trailer lets on.  In fact, it starts out with a funeral, then goes back three years and inexorably works towards that event.  You spend the entire movie wondering: whose funeral is it?  The answer is a controversial twist that has divided critics nationwide.  Everyone has an opinion.  In fact, another amazon reviewer (J. A . Crow) has one I read here (scroll down a bit) that made my jaw drop.  I'm not ruling that theory out.  Wow, if that's what Mike Binder designed and hid in this movie and you ferreted that out, sir or madam, my hat's off to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>I loved this film. But I recognize it's not for everyone.<br /><br />The theme reeks of an Ordinary People -- a pot-bellied Kevin Costner shacks up with his friend's abandoned wife (Joan Allen) to guzzle sixpacks like their plane is going down. Thus brews a school-girlish game of attraction, complete with giggles and hiding in the backyard, punctuated in parts by digressions of Allen's four daughters and some choice characters with varying levels of relevance to the theme.<br /><br />Recapping this moments-film would work as much as it would for the ilk of American Beauty or Ice Storm. Cheeky homages to urban cluelessness, studies of ordinary people in ordinary towns facing ordinary problems.<br /><br />But there's an extraordinary flair, a rhythm, to the way their stories are told. You keep watching because you relate to the characters and mull over their predicament long after the credits have rolled. The bookish narration may be one downside, you think, but traces of good humor and some taut acting all round are surely the upsides of anger and they make up handsomely.<br /><br />One for the discerning types. You may want to skip it if the relaxed rhythm of movies like Sideways or American Beauty ticks you off, but I recommend it to people with a taste for nuanced cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Showing dimensions she has not been allowed to display before onscreen, Joan Allen gives a fearless and fiercely comic performance as Terry Wolfmeyer, a suburban Detroit wife and mother of four daughters who apparently has been abandoned by her philandering husband. Director and screenwriter (as well as former stand-up comic) Mike Binder - who worked with Allen on 2000's "The Contender" playing her chief-of-staff - provides Allen with quite an explosive, warts-and-all showcase for her considerable acting prowess in this spirited 2005 comedy-drama.<br /><br />The plot seems to be an amalgam of Paul Mazursky's 1978 breakthrough "An Unmarried Woman", a reverse-angle take on Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice", and the quirky, ironic sensibilities of Sam Mendes' "American Beauty". However, the themes that Binder espouses are intriguing in that he explores the unremitting torrent of anger one woman feels toward life when she discovers one day that her husband is gone. As Terry deals with her anger through alcoholic binges and canoodling with Denny, the retired pro baseball neighbor, she emotionally abandons her four daughters against her best efforts.<br /><br />Played by Alicia Witt, oldest daughter Hadley just graduated college and becomes pregnant by an affable rich boy whom Terry describes as "not intelligent". Former "Felicity" star Keri Russell portrays aspiring ballet dancer Emily, who becomes anorexic and almost as angry as Terry. Evan Rachel Wood, superb in "Thirteen", plays youngest daughter "Popeye" (nicknamed for no explained reason), who provides the narration at the beginning and end through a class video project, while experimenting with drugs and developing a crush on a gay classmate. Rebellious Andy, portrayed by Erika Christensen, decides to get a job as a radio station production assistant rather than going to college. In the most nonchalant manner, she ends up sleeping with Shep Goodman, the sleazy producer who happens to be played by Binder. All four up-and-coming actresses are terrific within the confines of their roles.<br /><br />However, I have to hand the prize to Kevin Costner, who seems finally freed of the self-absorbed heroic roles he has been playing. In what has to be his most insightful performance since 1988's "Bull Durham", Costner plays Denny with an &eacute;lan he hasn't displayed in years. It is another baseball player role, but he infuses such humor, resignation and naked emotion into his gone-to-seed character, now a perpetually stoned disc jockey who patiently waits for Terry to see the "upside of anger", that sense of calm one feels in the end after all of the rage has been released. He does have a great moment when he kicks Terry's bathroom door down - rather than a romantic gesture, it summarizes the years of frustration in dealing with her paranoia and bitterness.<br /><br />I also appreciate how Binder realistically treats their mutual alcoholism as a way of life rather than a TV-movie disease eating away at them. There are certain times when the movie does veer toward triteness, and Binder likes to use fantasy sequences to express unspoken feelings - such as when Shep's head explodes at the dinner table to Terry's satisfaction - which are effective though a little too convenient for my taste. While not in the league of "The Sixth Sense", the much-discussed twist ending really makes the film more a parable about the futility of anger. It's a creative move by Binder, though it obviously prevents him from exploring the true upside of anger since it would mean explaining some story lapses.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is Allen's show and she is amazing - whether collecting her husband's belonging with fury much like Jill Clayburgh did in "An Unmarried Woman", reacting with silent disgust as she catches Andy and Shep in bed, spooning hesitantly with Denny, ordering another Bloody Mary in front of her prospective in-laws or decking Shep twice at Hadley's wedding. The DVD includes the standard ingredients - eight deleted scenes that were understandably excised, a rather lengthy making-of featurette at over thirty minutes (although I was amazed to discover most of the film was shot in London to keep down costs), and an alternate audio commentary track by Allen and Binder, which is alternately insightful and self-congratulatory. There are also some DVD-ROM features like the shooting script.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Hubby runs off with his wallet, leaving Mom and four daughters, and I'm not known for my love of soapies or of Kevin Costner. But this is a surpringly watchable movie. Humor, cruelty, and cruel humor in its sharp, witty dialogue keep it moving. Warm, too, and not always as predictable as a typical review might make it seem. At times, it tries to be more than it is, such as when waxing philosophical about "the upside of anger," but generally it's just a strikingly realistic portrayal of some less than perfect characters and how they interact. Dark comedy is my favorite kind, and it's pretty obvious everyone involved in this project gave it their best.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>First let me say I really like Joan Allen. Anyone who has seen such films as `The Crucible' and `The Contender' knows her enormous talent, and in `The Notebook' she even gave depth and nuance to a character that could have been very flat. If real upside of `Upside of Anger' should be named, it is the presence of Joan Allen, who can grab your attention simply by sitting at a dinner table as Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, angry wife who has taken to drinking after her husband left her house.<br /><br />To her comes easy-going neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), a radio dick jockey and retired pro baseball player. The main plot involves the curious relation between two hard-drinking lost souls Terry and Denny with comical touch from Director Mike Binder, who manages to create some mirthful moments out of this unlikely couple. It must be said that to his credit Mike Binder (who also appears as sleazy radio producer) has successfully extracted excellent performances from the two leads, but as I said, as to Joan Allen who can shine even in action flick like `Face Off,' this is no news.<br /><br />Terry has four daughters (played by Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt, Evan Rachel Wood), and all of them provide sub-plots. It is regrettable that for all the names assembled here, none of these fragmentary sub-plots are interesting. These girls tormented by their mother are meant as the flip side of `Little Women,' but none of them are allowed to have their own recognizable voices as Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. The episodes about them are mostly forgettable ones, or at best misfires with failed comic attempts that fall flat.<br /><br />But in addition to its overlong story, the film also suffers from two things: one is the frequent allusions to wars or news from Afghanistan. Perhaps these footages suggest another nature of anger, `downside' of it, but I don't think the anger of a deserted wife, understandable as it is, could be equated to that of the people living in strife-torn countries.<br /><br />The other drawback is a simpler one. There is a surprise waiting for you at the end which I cannot disclose here. The surprise, I think, is meant for irony, giving another meaning to Terry's constant anger, but if Terry had done what a normal person, angry or not, would usually do, there would have been no such surprise as this.<br /><br />For all the brilliant acting from Joan Allen, I really want to ask you ... Can a person be angry for three years like Terry? Maybe he or she can, but the film would not tell us much about such people or Terry, whose hell-raising anger really makes her daughters miserable. Yes, some viewers would find it amusing to see the characters behaving badly to each other or in public, and I have no problem with that. But at the same time what kind of a film is it when it is based on a contrived premise and hateful characters whose portraits can show little insight or wisdom? But of course, it depends. I know. Still I think there are better ways for these talented actors to show the characters' anger than 'Scanners'-like 'head-explosion' episode or Kevin Costner's kicking down a bedroom door.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Terry (Allen) is in a bit of a pickle...you see her husband has left her without a word for his Swedish secretary and now she has to raise her four daughters on her own.  They all hate her at various stages of the film and she can't seem to forgive herself for driving her husband away nor forgive him for leaving.  And then Denny (Costner), the former baseball player, current discjockey, always drunk next door neighbor trys to help by forcebly becoming Terry's drinking buddy.  Their relationship grows, there bond and his bond with her daughters strengthens as they learn together the truth of her husbands sudden departure.  The acting is wonderful here on the part of Allen and Costner and thats really what carries this simple plot from being slightly entertaining to wonderfully made and a very rewatchable film.  Sometimes we don't give ourselves the opertunity to greive like we should...we bottle up out anger instead of properly displacing it and we end up hurting the ones we love because we have to let it out somehow and it usually comes out wrong.  Allen, who should be up for an oscar here, may not make it to the final race but she will always remain to me the dark horse that should have made it.  Costner is a comedic turn I never knew he could pull resinates with laughter and lightheartedness that gives him a cute, playfull puppy essence about him here and just makes you want to pinch his cheaks.  Supporting actor maybe...not gonna happen, but it should.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Can a film about an embittered wife - whose husband left her to head to Sweden with his secretary - make for interesting watching, and not seem like a chick-flick or invite opportunities for male-bashing? Surprisingly the answer is "yes".<br /><br />Meet Mrs. Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen), a woman on the edge. Her husband's run off with the office slut (or so she thinks) and now she's left to finish off raising their almost-adult daughters. Add to this a drinking, washed-up, baseball hall-of-famer who lives nearby and is "interested" in her, and you've created an entirely new layer.<br /><br />Mrs. Wolfmeyer is forced to battle alcoholism, parental duties related to sex and relationships, and, most destructively, her own anger. She pushes away all those whom she loves, and does so via some hilarious film making. For instance, there's a scene where she's at a restaurant table and has just discovered that her eldest daughter (who's in college) is pregnant and getting married. She meets her future son-in-law's parents and proposes a toast, at which time she drains her bloody mary. Then, when she sits, she raises her glass again to signal to a waiter that she needs another, and everyone thinks she's making another toast, so they raise their glasses again. Extremely funny moments like this punctuate what could have been a drab and dreary movie.<br /><br />Kevin Costner pulls off his best roll to date, creating a deep and equally shallow man all wrapped in one. His on-screen persona was so much different than anything I'd ever seen him play before. I'd dare say that this is my favorite Costner performance.<br /><br />The film pulls you not-so-gently into these people's lives and makes us live with them during their best and worst times (sometimes it's difficult to tell when you're in a "best time" versus a "worst time", too.)<br /><br />The ending was definitely a shocker; something that came out of the blue and plowed into me. A pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The only issues some might have with the movie is that it has no action. There's no battle scenes or fight sequences. It's a human tale with real people living out real problems. If you enjoyed such films as THE SHIPPING NEWS and the like, you'll probably enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Somewhere in this well produced and marvelously acted movie, there might have been a script that was coherent and pertinent.  However, director Mike Binder's movie ultimately becomes rather pointless, particularly in its out of nowhere ending and resolution.  Joan Allen is as always marvelous as Terry, a middle-aged wife whose husband vanishes from their life, apparently running off to Sweden with his assistant.  He leaves Allen with four attractive daughters who have their own personal demons:  Erika Christensen as a spritely young girl who eschews college to seek a job as a production assistant for a smarmy radio producer (director Mike Binder in an engaging performance); Keri Russell as a dancing hopeful who lets stress and dieting almost end her chances; Alicia Witt as a strong-willed daughter who finds herself married and pregnant upon her college graduation; and fifteen year old Evan Rachel Wood who falls for a [...] guy and is doing her own documentary on violence and anger.  In a career rejuvenating role, Kevin Costner is great as a baseball star who integrates his way into Allen and her daughters lives.  All this is well and good, but the movie doesn't offer any information as to the disintegration of Allen's marriage and Allen actually isn't a very likeable mother or character.  While the movie's performances are entertaining, the end result is less than ingratiating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>Watching a mature film like Upside of Anger proves to be one of the more entertaining aspects of growing old. To be real, this is a movie for mature audience. The theater I was in was half packed and most of the audience was older then I was (being in my mid-40s).<br /><br />This film was blessed by two major factors, Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Allen was near perfect as a woman betrayed (so she thought for most of the movie) and her anger (coupled with some hard drinking) kept her sane and strong although terribly hard to deal with from her four daughters' perceptions. Its a joy watching an artist at work as Allen totally dominate the screen every single scene she appears in. Kevin Costner always does well when he doesn't have to carry the film and playing a sort of a supporting player. This movie is definitely a "Joan Allen movie" instead of "Kevin Costner flick".<br /><br />The film was well supported by supporting actors and actresses which kept the story fresh and characters interesting. Maybe that may be the secret of this film, that lead characters of Allen and Costner are not very likable initially but yet they grow on you as the time passes. By the time the movie ends, and as they evolved as people, you began to root for their happiness.<br /><br />I found the suprise twist at the end to be bit too off-centered for my taste. It was for me, the weakest point of the movie that rises more questions then answers. If you see it, you will know why and asked the same questions that I did which the movie cannot answer. A weak link, luckily it only come at the end and doesn't the spoil the film as whole.<br /><br />Movie geared toward the late middle age crowd. I think most of the younger generation folks might get into it if they don't get bore first. But they can learn from it since they'll get old too someday.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Those famous words by Bob Dylan say a lot about the love in this movie. The characters here, especially the adults, are damaged, unable to cope with major disappointments and challenges in their lives. Denny Davies, Costner, once had it all. A star pitcher for a pro ball team, he is now reduced to talking sports on the radio and selling autographs, two lonely occupations that give him no pleasure. Terry Wolfmeyer, rich and mother of four lovely girls, has been abandoned by her husband. Both have descended into a state of perpetual inebriation, never severe enough to be life threatening, always severe enough to keep real emotions and maturity away. They bump together not because of love's strong magnetism, but rather, because unanchored boats in a harbor eventually must bump into each other during storms.<br /><br />The great strength of the movie is that these people are not attractive, they're whiny, cynical, self-pitying, narcissistic drunks. They hang together out of convenience and desperation, in time, some sort of affection develops. But Terry has to push Denny pretty hard before he can relocate the confidence and focus he must have had on the mound, and demand something real. It's a defining moment in the film, a moment when Terry and Denny realize the four daughters are far more mature than they are. In case you don't know the movie's surprise ending I will only say that in the final analysis it only cements what should have been pretty obvious already.  That is, both these people were extremely blessed and their wallowing, while understandable, is best viewed as a necessary stage of grieving and not a lifestyle.<br /><br />A point of clarification about the leads. Joan Allen is one of our best actresses, incapable of delivering anything less than a stellar performance. Mr. Costner, by contrast, earned this role I'm happy to say. It was not always thus. Before there was a Brad Pitt, before there was a Tom Cruise, the handsome young idiot devoid of acting talent women adored was Kevin Costner. The young Costner was so stiff on camera that blocks of wood actually complained that he was giving them a bad name. (For a great example, sample his performance in The Untouchables, you would bet he was holding his script.) Because of his completely undeserved success Costner was allowed to stick around and make more movies. In the process, he improved a good bit. In TUOA we see how much.<br /><br />Costner is loose in this role, rumpled, casual, messed up. Just right. When he does show passion, it's believable. That's a pleasure. To see Costner holding his own with an actress of Joan Allen's stature, and actually creating a meaningful synthesis that causes us to care, is an accomplishment. This is a smart, beautifully made movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>Joan Allen plays her very troubled character very well, and this is a perfect role for Costner.  The acting is superb in this film.  This is one of the best films of the year, not a superficial "chick flick" (ha).

And "The Upside of Anger," written and directed by Mike Binder, explores some hard realities that differ drastically from expectations and perceptions.<br /><br />The film opens with a funeral, a somber note which in a sense prepares you for what is to follow, after a flash back of three years, at which point the story begins.  Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) is at loose ends because her husband has run off with his secretary, leaving her and four daughters behind to fend for themselves.  Angry, distraught and a stone's throw from bitter, Terry turns to alcohol to deaden the effects of what has been a life-altering experience.  Luckily-- or maybe not-- Terry has a neighbor, Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), an ex-pro baseball player turned radio talk show host, with whom to share a drink and commiserate.  Her daughters (three teens and one in college) are supportive, as well-- to a point.  But they are each in their own way also struggling to understand why their father deserted them.  By all accounts, this was in no way a dysfunctional, angst-ridden family, so the actions of their father is a mystery to them all.  Naturally, it's a pivotal point in their lives, and before any of them can move on, especially Terry, they have to know why he did what he did.  In the meantime, with or without this needed closure, life is happening to and around them.<br /><br />Binder (who also appears in the film as the producer of Denny's radio show) displays an astute knowledge of human nature with this film, and how random the myriad twists and turns of life can be.  He holds your attention from the opening scene (who's funeral is it, anyway?), and just when you think you know where the story is going it takes an unexpected turn.  And he is in no way attempting to manipulate his audience; rather, he is giving you a reflection of the way life so often simply does not go the way you think it's going to.  It's a succinct look at relationships, and of how fragile-- as well as resilient-- we all can be.<br /><br />As Terry, Joan Allen sets vanity aside to create her character and turns in an Oscar caliber performance in doing so.  When she gets up in the morning she looks like a middle-aged woman with insufferable problems and a hangover, a woman in the throes of coping with a traumatic experience who is desperate to reconnect with a life she no longer has and who will do anything within her power to hang on to what she has left.  She's walking a tightrope over a deep abyss and she's understandably on edge, so when one of her girls tugs the rope and compromises her control and security, she quite naturally lashes out, proving the old adage you always hurt the one you love.  There's a scene in which a grieving Terry draws her hands to her breast and, head lowered, utters a cry, and anyone who has ever known any kind of grief or loss in their life will at that moment know exactly what she is going through.  It's a terrific piece of acting, a performance that is altogether affecting and memorable.<br /><br />And, as performances go, Kevin Costner, too, puts vanity aside to create a character that is entirely convincing.  Denny Davies is paunchy, his hair is thin and most of the time he looks as though he's had one beer too many.  Still, he's engaging, and you get the feeling there's a complex individual hiding behind an external simplicity that perhaps helps to mask his true feelings about a lot of things in his life, including his career on the diamond.  Why, for example, does he refuse to talk about baseball on his sports talk show?  In it's purity, this is arguably Costner's finest performance ever.<br /><br />Top notch performances are turned in, as well, by Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt as Terry's daughters, respectively, Andy, Popeye, Emily and Hadley; and by Binder himself as Shep.  In the end, "The Upside of Anger" is an involving, memorable film that celebrates life and leaves you with a sense of hope, that no matter how bad things get we all have the capacity to get through it and somehow find the light at the end of the tunnel.  And that's the magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>Stallone's response to Burt Young's question 'what do you see in my sister?' (Talia Shire) is kind of like Costner, drifting in an alcoholic fugue, the glory days as a Detroit Tiger (Denny McClain?) over, with the horribly emotionally wounded Joan Allen.<br /><br />This movie is reminiscent of the Diane Lane "Under the Tuscan Sun" story several years back. I found "Anger" much more engaging and was frankly bored by "Tuscan Sun."<br /><br />Part of that is due to Allen's brilliance and her ability to do more with what she was given than Lane was. And, frankly, Costner is better now aging than he was before saving the world and being heroic. I liked "For the Love of the Game" and I thought "Open Range" was one of the best westerns ever made.<br /><br />Here we deal with Allen's anger and the impact it has on her four daughters ranging from 15 to I imagine 23-24. Mike Binder knows that anger is like a drug and like a drug it allows us destructive self-pity and the excuse for not changing.<br /><br />Why Allen's husband disappeared is almost irrevelant as her rage is so close to the surface. That rage fuels the first 3/4ths of the movie.<br /><br />Costner plays sort of a sounding board and his accptance by the daughters as a friend-father-figure comes really earlier than his acceptance by Allen as a partner and a friend.<br /><br />My only criticism is that Binder does too much with the issues. The acting talents of the daughters are never really used and they drift from one crisis to another. Allen's 'my life just fell apart so let me be a psycho-witch' becomes tedious and her explosions, while brilliantly acted, causes one to wonder if her husband had the right idea.<br /><br />All of which is a credit to Allen and her own range. Here's a note on Costner. In both "Open Range" and "Anger" he acts a secondary role with brilliant actors (Duvall; Allen) and they draw from him his own deep talent. 4 stars.

The role gave her the guts and emotions she has been looking for in a role. She more than lives up to this role. She is gaunt and pale and angry, so much anger.  Her husband has mysteriously disappeared, and she guesses he is with his secretary in Australia. She has four daughters who are all in the throes of adulthood. Each has their own problems, and her new found anger and misery is just the topper. The daughters are quite introspective, as mother is not, and we learn from them, as we always learn from our children.<br /><br />Lavender "Popeye" Wolfmeyer: "Anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks. That's what I know now. It needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers. It's real, though - the fury, even when it isn't. It can change you... turn you... mold you and shape you into something you're not. The only upside to anger, then... is the person you become. Hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid to take the journey, someone that knows that the truth is, at best, a partially told story. That anger, like growth, comes in spurts and fits, and in its wake, leaves a new chance at acceptance, and the promise of calm. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child"<br /><br />Kevin Costner plays Denny Davies, the ex -Detroit baseball player from next door. He drinks, he eats to forget he is no longer a ballplayer, and forgets to try and move on with his life. He and Terry become friends and then lovers. They learn to live again, little by little. Their shared interests open up their emotions, and they learn to speak and voice their fears. The four daughters are remarkable in their roles, Erika Christensen...Andy Wolfmeyer, Keri Russell...Emily Wolfmeyer, Alicia Witt...Hadley Wolfmeyer, Evan Rachel Wood...Popeye Wolfmeyer. It is Keri Russell who brings sanity back to the family, and Evan Rachel Wood, as she always does, brings insight into the emotions and the fears and speaks them out loud. The ending of the movie, is a just cause and brings the family answers, and is the cream at the top of the bottle for this movie. "The Upside To Anger" is the person who you become. Recommended. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>After her performance in "The Ice Storm" it is no surprise that Joan Allen could carry a movie like "The Upside of Anger". Nor was it a surprise that she and Alicia Witt could beautifully play off each other in their confrontational mother and daughter roles. What did surprise was that the film featured equally strong performances from the other members of the cast. Even writer/director Mike Binder does a fine "on-screen" job as a slimy but not entirely unsympathetic radio producer. Kevin Costner would be wise to stay with this type of role (and with comedy) instead of big-budget epic stuff.<br /><br />The casting of Witt with Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, and Keri Russell as the four sisters was inspired. It was refreshing just to see a film family that looked enough alike physically to actually be related to each other. Since Christensen looks so much like Julia Stiles they could have even added a fifth sister although their resemblance is so strong that it might be confusing. All the subtle birth order distinctions felt right. The oldest (Witt) was the most connected to mom even though it did not appear so on the surface. The second (Christensen-who absolutely glows on the screen) was determined to be different than her older sister. The third (Russell) was the most connected to the father, missed him the most, and had the least understanding of the mother. The youngest (Wood) was way ahead of the curve and the most perceptive character in the film. Watch for all this stuff because it is there, and watch how no matter how down the mother becomes she continues to monitor the welfare of her daughters.<br /><br />Binder gave into the temptation to use cheesy special effect gimmicks several times (the explosion at the dinner table, the neighborhood transition from summer to winter, the ballet fantasy, and the daughters growing older during the funeral scene). Although done well they seemed out of place. Also Binder should review the Kent State shootings, there were four students killed-not six.<br /><br />There is a spectacular shot at the wedding. Beginning as an over the shoulder shot of Hadley (Witt) sucking in her "plump" cheeks, the camera pans slightly right and moves toward the wedding party as the focus changes to bring them out of a blur.<br /><br />The film's ironic twist in the last 15 minutes is borrowed wholesale from "Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice". I particularly liked Wood's beautiful narration which helped clarify the title and theme, necessary (or at least helpful) after this ironic story line twist. She managed to sound both detached and involved, it is actually the voice-over for her broadcasting class project. When we are suddenly forced to reevaluate everything that has gone before in what we thought was just an interesting comedy, Wood steps in and steers us to internalize the theme. They go out on a shot of Wood looking up from her Mac and smiling. Amazing.<br /><br />This is the best of Binder's writing: "Anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks. That's what I know now. It needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers. It's real though, the fury, even when it isn't. It can change you, turn you, mold you and shape you into something you're not. The only upside of anger then, is the person you become, hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid of its journey. Someone that knows that the truth is, at best, a partially told story. That anger, like growth, comes in spurts and fits and in its wake leaves a new chance of acceptance and the promise of calm".<br /><br />"The Upside of Anger" is one of those rare films that I believe everyone should make an effort to connect with, doing so will make you a better person. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>The Upside Of Anger has a very original theme about it. I'm not sure if its adapted from a book but it does indeed nail that sucker for emotion in me. Joan Allen acted rather well. I dont know why a certain reviewer is praising Kevin Costner. His role isnt all that substantial and since when is playing a drunk difficult? Joan Allen's character suffers from alcahol plus broken home induced anger. Although she doesnt slap people and scream, her behaviour is erratic because she cannot digest the fact that her husband has left her. She plays the mother of four beautiful girls who lives very different lives. I fell in love with the character of Emily for it was realistic and loveable.<br /><br />Does the movie deserve to be purchased?<br /><br />I'm not quite sure on this one although I do know that anyone who's a half movie watcher would have a good time watching it. Do watch the trailer to know what to expect. This movie has no comedy and it isnt something a family would sit and watch together. However, if you are a loner like me then I suggest you watch it right away.<br /><br />For some reason beyond my understanding of me, my favourite scene in the film was the one where the family goes to watch a dance and are sitting in the audience. That's what made me go WHOA since it's just ideal in realising an emotional gulp in one's own self.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Upside of Anger is a powerful movie with some really good acting. Even Costner, who I normally don't like, is good in it. The ladies who play the daughter are all great (though they normally are) A touching movie with a humerous touch</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Upside of Anger~ Joan Allen is a misnomer for this picture as it should have been called the upside of tedium. The movie is supposedely under 2 hours but it sure feels like one is watching it for 2 weeks, months or even years. Kevin Costner is ok in his role but the rest of the cast seemingly mail in their performances. The story line is alright but implodes at the end and the ending is kind of lame and predictable. It is strange to say this since Costner sure has made his sure of really bad and horrid movies over the years, but he is the star of this mediocre flick and prevents me from giving it one star. I was espcially perplexed that Keri Russel does such a lame job but the character that she was given was also paper thin so she did what she could with a bad part. This movie is tedious, boring, long and lame but still not so bad that it gets one star, but two stars is just what it deserves.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>There's plenty of anger, and angst, in this movie, but not nearly enough and not the right kind. Based on the flimsiest circumstantial evidence, the wife, Terry (Joan Allen), assumes that her heretofore responsible and loving husband has flown the coop with his Swedish secretary. Moreover, over a period of years she makes no serious effort to track him down. Instead, Terry, an intelligent, educated, stay-at-home mom living an upper class privileged lifestyle with four intelligent daughters ranging from fifteen to early twenties decides to immediately turn herself into an alcoholic. The anger she shows is mostly directed at the people closest to her.<br /><br />As soon as Terry starts drinking herself into a daily stupor, her neighbor Denny (Kevin Costner) ingratiates himself as her drinking buddy. Denny is an ex-baseball star who, for reasons unknown (anger, maybe?), became an alcoholic long ago. So these two alcoholics get along drinking and watching stupid TV shows all day. Well, they cut back on some of the TV once they become lovers. But they don't cut back on the booze.<br /><br />After years of putting up with Terry's "bad moods," which the sex doesn't seem to ameliorate, Denny gets fed up and starts showing some anger of his own. He kicks down a heavy door with Terry on the other side. If Terry had been standing closer to the door, she could easily have been killed. But hey, Denny was just expressing anger and a terrified Terry couldn't apologize enough for her bad moods, begging Denny to come back. And from that point on, Denny is no longer passive, no longer anyone's "bitch" (as he tells Terry). He's back to being a macho man, or his version of it: a sweet, loving man who's not afraid to kick butts or doors when anger calls for it.<br /><br />I could say more but it's all so disgustingly bad. The 15-year-old daughter concludes the movie with a "wise" epitaph about the upside of anger, which amounts to saying it's better on the other side of it. The only upside to this movie are all the cute girls.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>"The Upside of Anger" is a movie about trying to find the best in the worst situations, as the title may already suggest. There is an "upside" to anger. But I don't think the movie presents this idea in the most effective ways which is sad because the movie has so much promise.<br /><br /> The movie was made by first time writer\director Mike Bender. Bender, whom I think is talented, doesn't present these character is a realistic way. Allen and Costner, though at times quite wonderful to watch, seems to be too broad and cartoonish. The situations and characters seem to over-the-top. There is a level of sincerity missing.<br /><br /> The movie stars Joan Allen as Terry Wolfmeyer, who's husband has disappear, apparently he has gone to Sweden with his secretary and left behind his four daughts; Erika Christensen (Andy), Keri Russell (Emily), Evan Rachel Wood ("Popeye"), and Alice Witt (Hadley). The relationship between these people never hits a real note, and I should know since I currently leave in a house filled with women. My mother, two sisters, my grandmother and my aunt, beat that! Then there is Denny Davies (Costner) an ex ball player who host a radio show that refuses to talk about baseball. Soon Denny and Terry become drinking buddies, though we suspect Denny wants something more.<br /><br /> Despite all the film's flaws one has to admit Allen and Costner are likeable characters. Costner though needed this movie to come along. I can't think of the last decent film I've seen him in. After "Dances with Wolves" and "JFK" I don't know what happened to him. Allen on the other hand usual picks good roles. And her presents in this film makes us think of the much better "Ice Storm".<br /><br /> Now if Allen and Costner are the highpoints of the film then writer\director Mike Bender is the low point. What a terrible character he has written for himself. You would have thought given that he wrote the movie he might have given himself a better part. His character slows the movie down to a halt! He is not needed at all. The film could have gotten along fine without him. Bender, whom some may know as the star of a short lived HBO series "Mind of the Married Man" doesn't even do himself the service of playing a likeable jerk. If we could only see some good in his character with MIGHT put up with him, but there nothing there. I think the movie works best when Bender is offscreen.<br /><br /> I think if "The Upside of Anger" wouldn't have been so broad and try to define all of these characters a bit more this could have been a really great film. I remained only mildly entertained. I walked in with good intentions but very soon realized the movie wasn't going to live up to them.<br /><br /> The daughters in the film are played by some truly gifted young women. I'm a very big fan of Erika Christensen who after making the film "Traffic" hasn't quite been in anything as powerful as that film. It is though a nice recovery from "Swimfan" at the very least. And Evan Rachel Wood who was in "Thirteen" is fine in her role, but, I felt not used enough. I'm also a fan of Keri Russell's who I thought was great in "Felicity" though again her scenes with Allen don't quite hit home. I had difficulty buying what the movie was selling.<br /><br /> Overall I thik this is a harmless movie that people should see but just be warned a lot of the film's praise is slightly hyped. Also, for no apparent reason the film has a political bent. And I still don't understand what politics is doing in a movie like this.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Two wonderful performances given by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner save the film from becoming a dud. The movie doesn't quite seems real though. It's too broad and that hurts the movie from leaving much of an impression on us given the material.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>On occasion, an archipelago offers a metaphorical illustration for the human race in regards to relationships, as each island represents a human being.  In this metaphor the islands are dormant, unwilling to move, and only every 100 millennia these islands might bump into each other, as continental shifts sluggishly move great distances over a vast amount of time.  Thus, the water between the islands gives the impression of infinite distances, even though the physical distance might only be a mere foot.  Only an intangible source could generate such an elusive distance within human beings.  The director Mike Binder explores the notion of intangible distance within a broken family through his The Upside of Anger.<br /><br />Mike Binder does not waste any time in illustrating any complex ideas of how and what could possible create an endless distance within a family.  In the first scene, the daughter Lavender (Evan Rachel Wood), also known as Popeye, states, "A case in point in anger's ability to change us is my mother."  Through Popeye's statement, Binder verbally and visually focuses the attention to the mother, Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen).  Through Terry, an obvious sentiment emerges, anger in the form of a cold and merciless resentment, which she continuously tries to control in the haze of vodka.  Despite Terry's concentrated efforts to bottle up her feelings with alcohol, her resentment seeps through her tightly shut bottleneck, as everyone of any relation to her falls victim to her anguishing well-managed rage at the most awkward moments.<br /><br />After the opening where Terry and Popeye ride in the back of a limousine together with former baseball pro Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) to a funeral, the story jumps back three years.  Through this extensive flashback, the audience learns that Terry's husband Gray has left her for a young and beautiful Swedish secretary, which also seems to be the root for her anger.  Her neighbor Denny soon learns about Gray's departure, and invites himself into the home of the Wolfmeyer's with the help of his manipulative charm.  Together Terry and Denny become drinking buddies, as Denny also tries to drown the feeling of being a has-been.  Nonetheless, Denny and Terry get closer to one another while Terry's resentment and anger flare up in the most inappropriate moments where she ends up hurting her daughters emotionally.<br /><br />The absence of the father Gray has shaken the Wolfmeyer family to the core, as he never has attempted to contact them.  The neglect from the father furthers the emotional pain within the daughters who also must deal with their resentful mother.  It has also hurt Terry, as she never got the opportunity to get closure to her relationship with Gray.  Terry and her daughters have merely been left in an unfeeling no-mans land that is occasionally lightened up by the presence of Denny.  Nonetheless, the daughters also find their own struggles such as getting married, post-high school educational decisions, and the people that the daughters date adds to Terry's anger, which sporadically flares up in small explosions.<br /><br />The Upside of Anger is a film that resembles two recent films Imaginary Heroes (2004) and Garden State (2004) in regards to the cold and detached atmosphere in the film.  There is also some likeness with Little Women (1994), but regardless of the similarities with other films Binder succeeds in making a unique story that touches the audience.  The story delivers a dissection of anger in a woman who ends up hurting those she loves.  However, it is not the tearjerker that many might anticipate, but the film delivers several thoughtful messages worth pondering, as people try to reach across the water between the islands.</p></br></body></html>

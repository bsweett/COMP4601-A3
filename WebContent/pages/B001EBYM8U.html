It's a movie unlike any I have seen of its genera.  Even from watching some of the previews of the movie, I knew I was in for a wild and unpredictable ride.  And I was right.<p>Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke star in this powerhouse cop thriller.  Hawke plays rookie cop, Jake Hoyt.  Hoyt has dreams of becoming a detective, and hopes that he will be able to put away every single scum-of-the-earth criminal for good.  But before he can do that, he must survive a day with Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington).  And on this day, Hoyt will see the dark side of the streets, the job, and most importantly, the dark side of human beings.  The next 24 hours will be the longest hours of Rookie Jake Hoyt's life.<p>The acting is really amazing.  Of course, Washington is great, as he is in almost every role he takes.  But, he shows us he can break away from his traditional &quot;likable good guy&quot; roles, and take on the role of a sadistic and psychopathic cop who will do what it takes to get the job done at any cost.  Hawke is also terrific, and should've recieved more recognition for his part in the movie.  I also liked seeing Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as well; they proved to be very talented actors.<p>The writing is really effective; with very realistic and believable dialogue.  And Antoine Fuqua does a fabulous job as director.  Being that he knows exactly how it is on the streets, it made him that more of an effective director, and adds to the movie's credibility.<p>The DVD is not bad as well, being that it is a Warner Bros. DVD.  Usually, they don't add too many special features, but they did on this one.  Theres a bunch of deleted scenes, a making of feature, 2 music videos, the trailer of the movie, and many more.  The picture is crystal clear; presented in 16:9 widescreen.  And the sound is also great; quiet when it should be, and loud when it's supposed to be.<p>&quot;Training Day&quot; is a great movie filled with action, drama, and a lot of unpredictable twists and turns.  If you're looking for a good cop action/thriller that is unlike any other, then this just might be the movie for you.  A very unique and awesome movie that never gets old.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>Have you every done something that you normally didn't want to do just because someone else wants you to do it?  If you are in love, that's great, but often it's just because someone is at least a bit intimidating.  Or very intimidating.  You find that avoiding an arguement with the person is more important than your lack of desire for doing the task.  Unless you are a total bully, we've all experienced this.  <p>"Training Day" takes this to the extreme.  Ethan Hawke is on his first day with a special police unit that he wants very much to be a member of.  He very much wants to impress Denzel Washington, the leader of the group, but encounters problems from his first minute with Washington, and they only get worse from there.  It is the nightmare that unfolds that makes this well worth seeing.  <p>Cops are not choir boys, and the terrific new series "The Shield" points this out to the extreme.  When undercover cops work with trash, some of it is bound to rub off.  And I'm sure most of us would say there would be no way we would smoke a joint laced with PCP offered from the boss, especially on the first day on the job.  But where the movie succeeds in how the Oscar-winning intimidation by Denzel Washington makes it perfectly believeable that this could happen.  <p>Once that dirty deed is done, Hawke becomes almost putty in Washington's hands, and is taken from one harrowing situation to another.  You want to believe that some good will come of it.  After all, cops need to learn how things are done to effectively get their jobs done, and this sometimes means acting less than angellic.  You want to believe that Washington overall ends justify his means.  To see if this comes to pass, catch this movie, which is not for the faint of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>The movie itself has a somehow perdictable story but the acting which is superb, lifts the story above its 'standard' plot.<p>Alonzo's intentions about Jake's 'Training Day' are not what Jake (and us) think they are at the beginning of the movie. Alonzo's original intentions seemed to be to shock him and corrupt him - he perceives Jake as innocent, and wants to have some 'fun' with him. A good example of that is what he says after the squad kills Roger - he's been plannig Jake's day for a week. That's obvious on a second watching: he made sure he'd have PCP laced weed pretty early in the day, and knows how to push Jake into smoking it - just to make sure he has something he can control Jake with if he needs to... But he hardly has to use it against Jake throughout the day: he's in total control, and knows the turf, and the 'street rules' - unlike Jake, who's new and too idealistic to unerstand them - at least at first. The 'Training Day' isn't meant to train Jake to join Alonzo's unit, but after it's over Jake has received some valuable training: how he can survive in the streets. Some of what he learns comes from Alonzo, but he manages to combine it with his own common sense - by taking the girl's wallet, he eventually manages to save his own life, even though Alonzo discourages him - after all, Alonzo's 'Street Justice' has been done. This goes against another one of Alonzo's lessons: don't show your sensitivities to the world. But by showing it in case of the girl - again, he manages to not only save his life, but to establish a connection with Smiley, which might help him later on.<p>As the day (and the movie) progresses, we see that Alonzo's attitude towards ake changes - he starts taking him seriously, until he realizes how much Jake doesn't fit in when they raid Roger's house. But he still doesn't take him seriously enough - when Jake comes by his house after survivng the poker game, Alonzo still tries to pretend that it was all a test, and having survived the experience made him get into the squad. But Alonzo hadn't realized that he'd taken it too far, just as he doesn't realize it about other events in his life - he thinks that the neighborhood's fear of him is respect, for instance. Or his son -the little boy trusts Jake after only one meeting more than Alonzo could ever hope for. And this time - Alonzo isn't able to use his charm or force as a policeman to get out of this situation...</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Well, Denzel's Oscar was no Hollywood "gimme", he earned it all the way with a powerful and disturbing portrayal.  Beside being a consistently terrific actor, Denzel Washington is a true Movie Star.  He commands the screen the way the young Brando or Newman did, with complete authority.  And he was really on his game here.  The 5 stars are for his performance!<p>I have not been a fan of Ethan Hawke in some of his earlier, arsty-fartsy Mr. Sensitivo roles.  So I was surprised at how well he held his own opposite the power of Washington in this film.  Will reserve judgement on Mr. Hawke for the future.<p>So, these two fine nominated & deserving performances are worth the trip alone.  The film's main problem is it becomes a bit excessive & melodramatic toward the end.  Will put some off, but by then, I was hooked into the flick and was willing to go wherever it went.  <p>Not just about a twisted cop who has completely lost his moral compass and bearings and has become the thing he started out to destroy, the Hawke character gets in deep because of his own ambition, the same type of desire for power that must have fed Washington's young Alonzo, before his complete corruption.<p>So we have a two character waltz, of the seducer (the Devil assumes a pleasing shape) and the honest, naive, but flawed  seducee.  We watch Alonzo tempt and belittle and flatter his young protege, bending him to his will.  We watch Jake be shocked, resist and argue but give in to his own ambition.  And there are surprises to come.<p>The movie is tough & brutal, the dialogue fast & gritty,  the direction fluid and restless, all pulsing to the beat of these hot LA streets.  Not a perfect flick, but a riveting one. 4-1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I am so glad Washington won the Best Actor Oscar ...for an unsaintly role. ...Washington inhabits this movie from the moment he appears onscreen and I'm glad to report that as a villain he is not over the top....Not here. Washington fully fleshes out this LAPD narcotics star policeman and how he's gotten to the top of his field by becoming one with the enemy.  In fact, you can even see the tidbits left over in his personality from the man he used to be.  Washington gives us little flashes of that man, showing us they are just about totally gone but not quite.  Ethan Hawke always holds his own in a movie and this one is no exception.  His is a less showy role since he is the good guy cop but he nicely develops his character's moral dilemma throughout.  He is a squeaky clean young cop who is dedicated to eradicating crime the "right" way but his idealism looks fair to crushing him in modern day LA and with the LAPD. A very well written script, a stylish director who knew what he wanted to accomplish, actual LA gang members in the cast and some good performances from music industry members round out the film nicely.  I am not a fan of "cop" movies but this movie does not fit easily into any broad ...[category], thankfully.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington's chilling portrayal of Alonzo Harris, a corrupt, murderous narcotics Cop, dominates this gripping crime drama. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a rookie "auditioning" for a spot with Harris' squad. Before his"Training Day" is over, Jake will fall into a vortex of corruption, murder, and betrayal, and see his belief in the system turned upside-down.<p>  Washington does his usual great job; You'll spend the entire film hating him, but being drawn in by his charisma at the same time. Hawke delivers an equally solid, if less flashy, performance, and holds his own with Washington. Great casting all around; Supporting players Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Scott Glenn also add a lot to the film. Director Antoine Fuqua keeps the film moving at a breakneck pace, and the ending is phenomenal.<p>  The extras on the DVD include the HBO "Making Of" Documentary, deleted scenes (All of which would have added a lot to the film), 2 music videos, and an alternate ending, which answered a question I had about the film when I saw it in it's theatrical release.<p>  Overall, an exceptional film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I have no problem with Denzel Washington receiving the Oscar for "Training Day," because the history of the Academy Awards is filled with winners who were probably being honored for a body of work rather (e.g., John Wayne, Henry Fonda) or making up for an earlier snub (e.g., Jimmy Stewart, Al Pacino) than a career best performance (e.g., Yul Brynner, F. Murray Abraham).  All of this is certainly debatable but Washington's performance as Detective Alonzo Harris, the philosophical narcotics detective who is teaching the rules of the street to wannabe detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is certainly a solid characterization.  How memorable you consider it probably has to do with you are a fan of Washington or the genre; for the former, this is a radical departure for the actor that standard in marked contrast to everything he has done to date, but for the latter the most significant different would be that this time the younger cop is being taught by an older cop who happens to be black.  <p>The strength of the film is not so much Washington's performance as it is the way both the character of Jake and the audience are put in the perspective of wondering how much of Alonzo's "training" is legit, and how much is some sort of put-on, ruse, or test for the rookie.  Early on it becomes clear that Jake has no clue as to what is really going on, and neither do we.  Jake is a bit too na?ve at the start, especially if he thinks a drug dealer is going to let him refuse an offer to toke up, but no matter how much he knows he would clearly be in over his head before long as Alonzo laws down his personal blend of street justice and economic opportunity.  Screenwriter David Ayer is definitely comfortable in this genre, having deal with undercover cops in both his previous film, "The Fast and the Furious," and the upcoming "Dark Blue," but there is one thing that I think constitutes a glaring error in the film, which really got in the way of my enjoying the final act.<p>I think that anybody who has watched a moderate amount of cop shows on television or seen their fair share of movies about cops during their jobs, knows what happens to a cop who shoots somebody.  Well, that does not happen in this film.  In fact, one of Alonzo's boasts is that he and his men are protected by their captain from such legal inconveniences.  Of course, if they follow standard procedure then the rest of the film does not happen, so Ayer take what I consider a rather large liberty with the real world because with the multi-million dollar lawsuits waiting around every corner I cannot believe there is a major police force in the country that does not cover its rear ends completely on officer involved shootings, no matter who the victim happens to be.  <p>Of course, this might just be me, and you can certainly see this plot element as a speed bump rather than a major roadblock.  When we get to the climax of "Training Day" the big question is what is going to happen and who is going to be left standing.  In a film like this, given the strong acting performances by both of the main characters, I cannot imagine what more your little heart could desire.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>One cannot certainly argue the merits of Denzel Washington's performance as the crooked but hard-hitting cop in TRAINING DAY.<p>One, however, can easily argue the merits of whether or not the performance deserved Academy Award recognition, and I would imagine that this will become an argument for the ages.<p>Is it truly noteworthy (or awardworthy) to grant one of cinema's most gift and rightfully revered African American actors the distinction of playing such a stereotypical role?  In all honesty, does Mr. Washington want to be remember more for THIS role than he would the perceptive Ezekial Rawlins in DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS ... or the brave submarine commander in CRIMSON TIDE ... or the military officer trying to find a personal sense of purpose in death in combat in COURAGE UNDER FIRE ... or the Civil Rights leader in MALCOLM X?<p>Granted, the AMPAS cannot undo history and go back to honor Denzel for roles that truly showed distinction, but we've seen the detective he played in TRAINING DAY in hundreds of other films, portrayed by hundreds of other gifted actors, in similar situations.  To award someone with the talent of Denzel Washington film's highest honor for such a stereotypical role is, perhaps, film history's greatest injustice.<p>That said, the plot -- while predictable -- unfolds as the young recruit (played by the always-forgettable Ethan Hawke) realizes he's being used, rises to the occasion, and saves the day.</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>The movie is mediocre. A cop movie that is brutal and definitely action packed. BUT, both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawk brought their A game for this film. Washington is Stellar in every movie he does, but he plays the monster in this one to the hilt. He is the movie. Despite the materials mediocrity, I can rewatch this one and always be taken in by Mr. Washington's powerful performance. He's the MAN.<br />I met with a friend of mine today to loan her some movies (I like to share) and I mentioned Denzel Washington.<br />She agreed That he is one of our best contemporary actors. She then said she doesn't like really violent movies, but was conflicted about the movie TRAINING DAY because both DENZEL WASHINGTON and ETHAN HAWKE were so magnificent in this movie, she liked to watch it anyway. (By the way, she agreed the movie was mediocre) It's all about the acting in this one. These two guys are the very best in this film!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.6 stars<br /><br />Having seen this a half dozen times over the last decade, it just keeps getting better, entirely due to Washington's dead-on turn as the nastiest villain around, who just happens to be a cop. What are the odds?<br /><br />Hawke is decent and a solid foil, but this one is all Denzel all the time. His diner scene is so amazingly edgy, and funny in all the wrong ways, as are so many others here. He sells this guy to perfection, or whatever the opposite of that is. Along with a fine script that's all too believable, and some tight direction, he takes this flick into places few Hollywood movies dare go. Hawke's Serpico Jr. is at his best in the kitchen/bathtub scene, a true classic; those are some good bad guys, ese.<br /><br />The blu-ray features a good transfer and a nice little doc on the film as well as 12 minutes of occasionally great deleted scenes, a few of which should have stayed in the movie, the beer scene especially. Also included is a crisp commentary by director Fuqua that answers lots of questions, and poses a few more.<br /><br />The only niggles in Training Day are a few weak continuity moments, like the three bullet holes in the back window. So where'd they exit? They all missed the two guysin front, and also didn't go out the front window after leaving one inch entry holes? In a film this real-feeling, stuff like that dulls the edge. But just a bit.<br /><br />Denzel is a great good guy, we all know that. But here he's also one of cinema's best bad guys. And while we all want Luke to win, let's face it: Darth is more fun to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />I remember seeing "Training Day" at the cinema in 2001 - the audience applauded at the end - and most left their seats with its gritty brilliance seared into their unconscious. I'm glad to say that revisiting this urban drug story in 2012 finds that Antoine Fuqua's directorial debut hasn't lost one jot of its power - and better still - is now genuinely enhanced by its reissue on BLU RAY.<br /><br />The picture quality is far better than I expected - a really crisp transfer. Its default aspect is 2.4:1 - so there are bars top and bottom of the screen - but even stretched to full frame - the print quality still holds up. A lot of the scenes are one-on-one dialogue pieces in the front of cars between the two male leads - but expertly filmed and edited - there's no real blocking. Side shots of their faces are startlingly clear - even the sequences towards the end in people's homes and out on the streets at night are very, very clean. It's a top-notch transfer...<br /><br />Written by DAVID AYER (a white man who grew up in the South Central projects of Los Angeles) and directed by ANTOINE FUQUA (a black man who did the same)- it's about a fresh-faced cop Jake Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke) who is hooked up with legendary narcotics Detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington) for one 'training day'. From dawn to dusk - it will be a baptism of fire.<br /><br />At first Alonzo has the air of a man who's doing what he has to do to keep the river of drugs off the streets of Los Angeles. His methods may be brutal - but in the heat of street-justice - the end justifies the means. The problem is that while the young rookie cuts the mustard in the eagerness department, unfortunately he's also highly principled - and this begins to encrouch on Alonzo's habit of turning the other way when he's gathering info to make busts of the big guys (15,000 years of incarciration handed out and counting). Alonzo also feels that Hoyt's Academy naivety will get him killed in the real world (dialogue above). So Hoyt struggles. But then things get gradually murkier...and even life-threatening...<br /><br />Soon after a car bust - Jake is drawn into Alonzo's doped-up world and begins to feel like he's being played - but Alonzo keeps proffering believable reasons for his actions. Only a brave intervention (a young Latino girl being raped by two lowlifes in a lane) saves Jake from the clutches of a double-barrelled bathroom death. Soon (bruised and battered) Jake is taking the game to Alonzo's neighbourhood - and on it goes to a brilliant but inevitably bloody ending...<br /><br />Part of the reason why "Training Day" works is that there's an air of authenticity in the script that echoes The Wire and The Sopranos (both Author and Director have been there). The bad language and street talk is either vicious or impenetrable - and frequently both. A dance of fear and intimidation co-exists between the cops and the largely Black and Latino communities. No one is clean and few get away from it unaffected. Some areas of the city are even no-go zones - poverty and bad housing being a breeding ground. Gun law abounds and it's hard to tell the difference between Dictators - the drug-pusher or the police officer who protects the drug-pusher...<br /><br />Denzel is truly magnificent in the part (a departure from his nice-guy roles) - he inhabits his gold-chained Alonzo with a power and ferocity that few actors could even get near. You feel this mouthy monster owning the areas he walks into and you understand why many of them smile as Alonzo approaches - but would gladly put several bullets in his back as he leaves. Ethan Hawke does well to keep up with such a tour-de-force - and at times - even matches him. It's not surprising that Washington took his 2nd Oscar for it ("Philadelphia" was his first).<br /><br />The supporting cast too is exceptional - rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as drug-dealing hoodies - singer Macy Gray as a crack wife - Eve Mendes as Alonzo's squeeze - Scott Glen as an old veteran - and the trio of corrupt officials - Tom Berenger, Raymond J. Barry and Harris Yulin (who feature in the 'Alternate Ending' in the Extras). And special mention should also go to the locals and the then unknown Latino cast - some of who are actually gang members. Fantastic stuff...and so impressive...<br /><br />To sum up - a great film then - now made better by a format that allows it to shine.<br />This is precisely what a good BLU RAY reissue should be.<br /><br />Recommended like a hard rock in the crack den at the back of The White House...(yo Barrack).<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />VIDEO: 1080p High Definition 2.4:1 Aspect Ratio<br />AUDIO: Dolby Digital English 5.1, French 5.1 and German 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English, French and German<br />EXTRAS:<br />1.

He gets a new partner in the form of Ethan Hawke, a young and innocent new rookie cop who is shocked by his partners unorthadox ways. "Training Day" is fast-paced, involving, and action packed, and just when you think the villin is going to get away with being bad, your vaulted out of your seat. Normally villins in movie history never win Oscars for their portrayals, but Denzel is so convincing you forget any of his other performances, a true mark of a splendid and versatile actor. The DVD set comes with audio commentary, an HBO look behind the scenes of the movie, 2 music videos, alternate ending, and more. The DVD is single layered. Rolling Stone says, "Denzel Washington is a sparking, snapping live wire".</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I'm sure that many fans were shocked when Denzil Washington did an about face from his good guy roles by playing Alonzo Harris, the bad cop to end all bad cops.  He richly deserved the Oscar and I believe that the intensity of his performance also uplifted Ethan Hawke's performance since he received his first Oscar nomination.  Before this film I was indifferent to Hawke, believeing him to be a competent but stiff actor but this film and the remake of "Assaust On Precinct 13" has changed my opinion of him as an actor. The "bad cop movie" is nothing new having its roots in the fifties with films like "Rogue Cop", "Pushover" and "Shield for Murder" as prime examples of this genre but this film pushes it to a higher level.  And also the timing of this film helped at the box-office since the Ramparts scandal of the LAPD was in progress when this film was released.  If you're a fan of this genre or a fan of great acting, this flick is recommended.  It's also still available at a premium price in HD DVD (fantastic transfer!!) versus the $18 or $20 you'll have to pay for in Blu-Ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>I can say that the film has no flaws. Also Ethan Hawke's characters is not subdued, in fact, Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt) while being sensitive and moral, is at the same intense level as Denzel Washington's.<br /><br />You can't write a review, without describing the plot.<br /><br />The story is very real and vivid. It concerns a rookie cop named<br />Jake Hoyt (Hawke) who is assigned to a veteran narcotics cop named Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).<br /><br />During hia first few days on the job. Hoyr observes how Harris does his job of busting crooks and drug dealers. Alonzo is like a Dirty Harry movie, everyone in the city knows who he is and is scared to death of the gritty cop.<br /><br />However, underneath, that great cop lies a crooked, corrupt policeman who is playing both sides of the law.... This is Denzel Washington best role ever, and he won the Oscar over Russell Crowe for best actor and it was well deserved.<br /><br />Denzel through Alonzo creates another memorable corrupt villain<br />in film history.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is also great as Jake Hoyt. In fact both actors were nominated for their roles in the movie.<br /><br />I just checked out the DVD, and it's absolutely fantastic!!!<br /><br />The alternate ending is actually almost identical to the original ending, the making of features are great though along<br />with the candid commentary by Antoine Fuqua.<br /><br />It was the movie of the year in 2001 and still holds up as corrupt law enforcement is still alive today.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Denzil Washington arguably is one of the best if not one of the Top Ten actors (male) working in Hollywood in present time. This is not a bold statement. He's a natural, and has that innate ability to evoke emotion from his audience.<br /><br />Denzil won the Oscar for Best Actor in 2002 for his role in Training Day. I have not seen the film in years and it presented itself the other day, reminding me that actors like Ethan Hawke & Denzil Washington, when working with a good script, (author, David Ayer) can do wonders...and both artists' certainly rose to this particular occasion, making Training Day a memorable film.<br /><br />Personally, when not reading for study or research, good thrillers and detective stories are my genre of choice; Training Day from the start pulled me in as we do not know how "bad" Alonzo (Washington) really is...but he's bad to the bone!<br /><br />Training Day is not your usual plot for this genre.<br /><br />Training Day is a well crafted film, authentic L.A. locations, great soundtrack, and Director Antoine Fuqua along with the spot on editing of Conrad Buff and excellent soundtrack (original) Mark Mancina along with the original song by Tobin Asperence, "Last Resort", only adds to the films production value and class.<br /><br />But films like Training Day are the films that attempt to reveal "reality" in its based form and accomplishes it.<br /><br />Seeing Training Day again after many years shows me that the attempt to suspend disbelief, particularly pushing for genuine "reality" in film, with a good script and great actors, is hard to beat.<br /><br />Training Day is one such film.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>If there was a performance that is equal to some of the most ruthless characters in screen history, then Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance as L.A. Detective Alonzo Harris is right up there.  He is evil as he is charming.  Washington is clearly enamored by his character and any resemblance to other "goody-two-shoes" performances has been destroyed.  Ethan Hawke also give an Oscar nominated performance as the rookie trying to work the fine line of ethical behavior.  The current climate of the LAPD surely isn't going to help with this film as it's another siering indictment against the police establishment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Training Day sheds light (as it should do) on police corruption as well as on crime and violence in the streets and neighborhoods of Los Angeles.<br /><br />It is officer Hoyt's first day under the supervision and tutelage of LAPD detective Alonzo Harris, when things take a quick turn for the unexpected...<br /><br />Ethan Hawke, Denzel Washington, Snoop Dogg, Tom Berenger, Macy Gray (!), Samantha Esteban (who is HOT!!!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.<br /><br />In short, the music, the acting, the plot, the setting, and the dialogues are all good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Antoine Fuqua has made an excellent film for those who are looking for pure action. If your goal is more intelligent fare this may not be for you.<p>The story involves a day in the life of LAPD rookie officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)as he attempts to join an elite narcotics division led by decorated officer Alonzo Harris( Denzel Washington) What Hoyt does not realize is that Harris is not as good a cop as he is made out to be. Denzel Washington (in his Oscar winning role) plays the bad cop with gusto. While it may not be his best performance it certainly is not his worst. Washington comes across as a kind of police version of Tony Montana and the end of the film becomes sort of cartoonish.<p>Hawke does a good job playing the rookie who makes bad choices throughout the film Fuqua says that these choices are all related to ambition and I will buy into that theory to some extent.<p>This is essentially a two character film and both leads acquit themselves quite well. Support is offered by Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Dr. Dre as a member of Alonzo's unit and Snoop Dogg as another dealer on the streets. Los Angeles is portrayed to great effect and the texture is suitably gritty. Fuqua shot the film in parts of the city that most tourists don't see and the viewer feels the pulse of the streets.<p>I will admit that I liked the film more after a second viewing with Fuqua's audio commentary. The disc provides a featurette and trailer plus two music videos.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington has played many brilliant characters in the past, most notably Malcolm X and The Hurricane, Rubin Carter. Unlike those real life characters, Alonzo Harris has no ties with reality,  thank God. This character is a cop who has been in the streets for too long dealing with scum that eventually his mind and morale went crooked. Trust me, we do not want these kind of characters wandering our streets! Denzel nails the part with extreme professionalism which earned him an Academy award for Best Actor.<p>Ethan Hawke, who plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt, is excited and yet very unlucky to be assigned to Harris for a his first day, training day. What Hoyt is about to experience is a day that he will be looking back at not as a day of his training to be a cop, but as a day he chose the moral path he would stick to for the rest of his life. <p>Antoine Fuqua's direction brings the realism of the streets and smoothens the atmosphere for his characters to express themselves freely, especially Washington who seems to steal every scene he's in with the dialogue that he conveys like a pro and its Ethan Hawke who does a wonderful job of staying one step behind Washington making the characters interactions one on one an interesting viewing.<p>The DVD features several bonuses including a behind the scenes segment, an alternate ending and a couple music videos.<p>Recommended<p>A-</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>training day snaps at you and it does that by Denzels gritty and pulsating performance.

The trailer I saw in the theatres made it look like a belated ripoff of The Corruptor, while director Antoine Fuqua's disastrous fumble with The Replacement Killers several years ago did nothing to boost my confidence.<p>My doubts were dispelled the minute Denzel Washington looked up from his newspaper.  It is indeed good to see Washington, one of the most gifted actors of our time, abandon the saintly martyrs he's been prone to playing for 10 years and sink his teeth into a role which allows him to show a mix of deep charisma and dangerous viciousness.  That same alchemy had made his breakthrough performance in 1989's Glory  amazingly compelling, and in Training Day, there isn't a single moment where Washington is less than completely absorbing.  Ethan Hawke also gives the performance of his career as Jake Hoyt, an idealistic but easily swayed young cop who finds himself drawn into a web of corruption, violence, and twisted morals.<p>Fuqua's directing is still overly stylish at times, but after a hyperactive first act, the film begins to roar.  David Ayer's script is dazzling, a combination of rat-a-tat street vernacular and relentless forward momentum, and after the midpoint of the movie, the intensity of the scenes would reach incredible levels.  And that's when Fuqua's show-offy camerawork finds a raison d'etre.  In this film, Fuqua even finds room for some comparatively simple scenes which are really like a breath of fresh air to his filmmaking -- for example, the &quot;you're a leader&quot; car scene, and that beautifully understated ending shot.  I hope he makes this part of his regular style, because there's only so much virtuoso camera one can take before it gets tiring, as is the case in the opening of the film.<p>A white-knuckle thriller, well worthy of the accolades it received.  I stand humbly corrected on my original predictions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, "Training Day," directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return.  The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in "Bullitt," when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, "That's where half of it is--"  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.<p> Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, "If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--"  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his "Training Day," is going to be a day that will change his life forever.<p> Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of "street-wise" reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  ...As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in "Lethal Weapon," or Eastwood's Harry in "Dirty Harry," the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.<p> Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.<p> The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, "Training Day" is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a crisp, action thriller that focuses on one day, the training day of rookie narcotics undercover cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Jake is to be trained by veteren narcotics squad supervisor Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Almost immediately, the viewer discerns that Jake's training day will be unlike any other day he has ever had. <p>Alonzo is an unbelievably corrupt cop, a once good cop who has lost his way. He now corrupts those cops who come under his command, all for one and one for all. Jake, the newcomer to the group, still innocent and wide eyed about his reasons for being a cop, will be a test of Alonzo's ability to corrupt the seemingly incorruptible. A series of trials and tribulations await Jake that day, situations that in his wildest imagination he could never have envisioned, all of them fiendishly and cleverly engineered by Alonzo. All of them insidious. All of them criminal. The only question is whether good will overcome evil.<p>Denzel Washington gives a performance of a lifetime and is certainly worthy of his Academy Award for Best Actor. He is at once both repelling and ingratiating as the character Alonzo Harris. His performance is charismatic, commanding, compelling, and completely mesmerizing as the narcotics commanding officer who has gone over the deep end and crossed a line that, once crossed, is final. Alonzo rules his territory and those within it with an iron hand, misjudging fear for respect. Murder and mayhem are the key words of his reign. He also seems to report to a trumvirate of corrupt police officials whom he refers to as the wisemen. Unfortunately for Alonzo, he has come to believe his own hype and bites off more than he can chew, ultimately pissing off the wrong people.  <p>Ethan Hawke gives his best performance ever, imbuing Jake with a vulnerability and innocence that is believable and compelling, making Jake's struggle with his situation all the more angst ridden. It is a balance of the desire to succeed and get ahead with the instinctive knowledge of right and wrong. The viewer sees Jake going along with Alonzo at first, wanting to please his superior officer, even when some of the things Alonzo asks him to do are not only transgressions of police procedure, but violations of the very laws that they are employed as police to enforce. As Alonzo inveigles Jake to cross the line, the viewer can see the struggle within Jake take place, as shock gives way to a struggle for his very survival. The only question is whether Jake's better nature will ultimately allow him to do what he believes to be right. Ethan Hawke's a performance is  certainly worthy of its Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<p>This is a gripping film, with a fair amount of violence. Wonderful performances are also given by Scott Glenn, a drug lord whose dream of retiring to the Phillipines is cut short, as well as by Macy Gray, who is sensational in the role of another drug lord's wife. While some of the film is over the top, it is a film that will not fail to entertain and engage the viewer. <p>The DVD is loaded with extras, providing a feature length adio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua, additional scenes, an alternate ending, two music videos, as well as a behind the scenes documentary. The picture and audio are both crystal clear. It is a first rate DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>There's non-stop action and non-stop violence in this remarkable police story as the big bad narcotics cop, played by Denzel Washington, trains a rookie, played by Ethan Hawke, as to the ways of the street.  Set it Los Angeles, the audience visits the hoods of the gangs as these two cops experience more activity in this one day than most cops experience in a lifetime.  Young Ethan Hawke is shocked over and over again as Denzel not only doesn't play by the book, but turns from simply being streetwise into an exaggerated symbol of the baddest of the bad.  And, even after the film goes to such extremes that reality is completely lost, I was still riveted to my seat as I experienced the wildest, most violent police drama I've ever seen. <p>The plot twists and turns and gradually unveils Denzel as a person to hate, even though there are moments when he can be admired.  I can well understand why he won an academy award for best actor for his thrilling performance. It's a shame that the plot gets a bit hazy during the last 15 minutes of the film, because, until then I had no trouble with it.  But, by that time it doesn't matter.  I was on the roller coaster ride already and there was nothing to do but hold on tight and go along for the ride.  For those who don't mind a huge dose of violence with a story that goes to extremes, this is for you.  It is pure entertainment and will make you forget all your own problems.  I loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>This movie is exhibit one supporting the old adage that actors often win a belated Oscar deserved for earlier work in a movie that scarcely qualifies for such an honor. While there is no mistaking the excellent performance of either Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke in this tale of a cop gone bad after spending too much time on the street, the mind reels to consider Washington performed as well as did Tom Wilkinson in "In The Bedroom" or Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind'. This movie is just not that much of a showcase for Denzel's considerable talents. <p>To begin with, the plot is hardly plausible, and it is downright silly to believe such patent nonsense as is presented here as the events transpiring in a single day.  Shades of James Bond! Whatever happened to the idea of presenting something believable? If we are talking "B" movie entertainment, fine. But if we are going to consider giving an actor an Oscar for an outstanding performance, it might be nice to have him deliver that role in something less than pop fantasy. Shades of old Rooster Cogburn in "True Grit"! As a fantasy escape vehicle, this gritty cop drama works well, but as a serious drama, it has holes big enough for Shallow Hal's girlfriend to waddle through. <p>All that said, it is an entertaining and action packed film. Indeed, this is a film overdosing on adrenaline, a movie with nothing but ups and precious few downers, except, of course, for the morality play at the end that serves, of course, to provide the filmgoer with a sense of closure and wrap the enigma of this bad cop up with a bow.  Yet a lot of bad guys get away with it, and this character certainly seems street-wise enough to have maneuvered his way out of the dilemma.  I enjoyed watching it, but felt the performances were not what I would expect from an Oscar-caliber effort at moviemaking. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>***Movie fact: "John Q" was filmed before "Training Day", but "Training Day" was released first because the producers felt that it's unusual for Denzel Washington to play a heartless villian.  They figured that if the audience didn't like him in that role, then "John Q" was to be the apology.<p>Denzel Washington needs no apologies for one of his best career performances in this wonderful action movie.  This is one of the more unique and the best police movies made in 2001.  It brilliantly desplicts the use and the dealing of narcotics.  This describes perfectly how to be a good and a bad cop.  <p>Washington deserved his second Oscar win for his portrayal of a criminal police officer, an unusual role for him.  This proves that the brilliant actor has many more monumental roles in the future.  Ethan Hawke deserved his first Oscar nomination as a cop in training trying to do the right thing.  Hopefully, Hawke is seen more often in the future in roles like this.  Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray prove in "Training Day" that they are talented outside of music.<p>The writers, the director, and the producers chose the perfect dark theme for this movie genre.  They make Washington's character's lifestyle as dark as it should be.  They desplict the drug houses and narcotic use as dirty as many of them are in real life.  They give Hawke's character the light that it deserves for being the good guy.  This combination blends with all events perfectly.<p>Those who are not used to such a unique movie may have to watch it twice to truly appreciate the quality.  The first watch may seem unproportioned.  The second watch will further understand all the scenes, therefore proportioning everything.</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>It's what you can prove.  My favorite motto from Denzel.  In this movie, a curropted cop gets a rookie, and tries to get him mixed in with his problems.  These are the main characters.<p>Alanzo Harris:Denzel won his first best actor's award ever(He won best supporting actor in Glory), and I see why, good acting, with using a lot of good metaphors and stuff.  He may seem like a good narcotics officer, but his actions will get him killed, unless he can pay off his debts.  But before he does that, he needs a pawn in his game.<p>Jake:Ethan Hawke played good in this movie too as a rookie cop.  He gets his chance at being a narcotics officer, thanks to Alanzo.  He has to show what he can prove in 24 hours, but a lot of bumps are up the road, and it prooves he's scared to find out the shocking truth.<p>The movie got off to a great start, and had very good twists, but when it rolled towards the end, it started to fall apart, and I was a pretty dissapointed how the movie ended, but Denzel stayed true to his acting roots all throughout the movie.  If you like to see Denzel at one of his finest, go pick this up, if you like a good ol' cop movie, then this will be interesting.  And remember, It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>This is a movie that you can watch with friends over if they want to see it or if you feel like watching a real expensive fictoidic version of 'Crooked Cops'. Denzel Washington is one bad motha... and jus' look into those piercing eyes and you can tell that if 'you' stab him in the back you probably won't live when you try to take two steps. Ethan Hawke plays and excellent rookie cop learning the ropes and doing things that make you wanna say 'stooooooooooopid' but it's that type of curiosity he has that makes Denzel's character unravel his covering of his bad side. Anyways I think this movie is and excellent buy and I am probably gonna get burned owning this copy cause I smell a special edition or something coming on the horizon! Still worth the look though!</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>I don't know if this is the way it works, but if it is, it's scary in its own right.  Denzel Washington's character is smart, mean and selfish.  He plays folks from both sides of the line to his advantage.  This movie is full of violence and double crossing and it continues on a straight line through all the perceived turns.  Denzel's character is mean from the beginning, you just don't see it.  He is the true meaning of the word 'player'.  He manipulates everyone around him. <p>The movie leaves you thinking throughout, is he a good guy gone bad?  A good guy trying to help?  Or a bad guy posing as a good one?  <p>Denzel does a find job (one of his best but his absolute best?)and Ethen Hawke does an extraordinary job as the rookie on his first day, the &quot;training day&quot;.  With a cameo by Tom Berrenger and a small part for Scott Glenn this movie is cutting. <p>Take notice though - in the final scene the van disappears!  Watch and you'll understand.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous.  Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.<p>One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.<p>Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation.  However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both "Hurricane" and "Malcom X".  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for "Scent of a Woman" instead of going to him for his performance in "Malcolm X".  In "Training Day", Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.<p>Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.<p>This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real.  And to be great, cop stories need to be real.  I rated it 7/10.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>....not the best Denzel performance I've seen (I take the view that the Academy gave him a 'body of work' Oscar for work he should have gotten the statue for in other, more powerful roles for the one he received on this one.), nor the worst. Nor is the corrupt cop thing anything new. Ain't people seen any one of those made for tv cop dramas or moovys like "Internal Affairs", "Q and A", "Serpico"? This is cool in that it's nice to see Denzel have a less than good-guy role and do it well. But, a blistering, powerful story? I recall parts of "Q and A" made me really cringe. This made me laugh at a few of those lines Denzel shot at the rookie, but I have seen many moovys that were about corrupt cops and their actions that actually got under my skin.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>This is a very intense police drama that stares Denzel Washington, as the evil, very corrupt narc Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke, as the "rookie", Jake Hoyt, who spends one day on the job with Alonzo.  Little does he know that Alonzo is so hard nosed, and that he joins in the drug inducing along with the creeps he is trying to bring down.<br />Jake has quite a day with Alonzo.  Washington's Alonzo is unnerving but brilliant!!  He is one of the best actors and has my deepest admiration for going against the type of characters he usually plays.  It was very brave of him to take on this role.  I found myself shocked at some of the things the character said and did, especially since he is supposed to be a police officer, but I guess they aren't all so good, and Alonzo Harris is definitely one of the baddest cops to grace the big screen.  Although, I was so amazingly entralled by this movie, I also found it difficult to watch, but couldn't stop watching because it was just so darn interesting and intense.<br />I found the acting all around was very good.  Denzel is so excellent in this.  He is such a talented actor, and I am glad he did this movie.  It really shows that he is not afraid to try any role that he finds interesting no matter how immoral that character may be.  I think it came at a good time.  He was always seen as the good guy; this proves to me that Denzel is a real actor who cares about the craft of acting.<br />Ethan Hawke was also excellent in this.  Before this movie, I had only seen him in "Reality Bites", which was a comedy.<br />Kudos to him for taking on this role!  It was a great performance.<br />This movie is so worth watching because it of the strong performances by Washington and Hawke and it's capability to keep the viewer glued to the screen.  I didn't want to take my eyes away from the screen nor get up for any reason.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>i loved this tale of crookedness. denzel washington plays his best role as the cop whos very crooked and ethan hawke is the rookie cop. alonzo (dw) exposes hawke to drugs and life on the streets. ok denzel deserves the oscar. hawke does too. this is the most realistic cop movie since one tough cop. just see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>"Training Day" is among one of those films that you would have to watch very carefully to find out exactly what is going on throughout. And yet, it is so entertaining and so powerful that you would not believe Denzel Washington's performance in this movie until you have seen it! And speaking of his performance, you get to see a side of Denzel that you have never seen before...as the bad guy! That's right! Washington stars as veteran Detective Sargeant Alonzo Harris, a "lone wolf" cop that, to him, has spent too many years obeying the law, etc., that he goes over the edge (a.k.a. "crossing the line"). This film is also about a fresh-faced LAPD rookie named Jake Hoyt (an excellent Ethan Hawke), who is anxious to join the elite narcotics squad headed up by none other than Harris himself. So Harris has agreed to give Hoyt a shot at joining his team with a one-day ride-along during which Hoyt must prove his mettle if he wants to make it into narcotics. As the day wears on, however, it becomes increasingly clear to the greenhorn that Hoyt's experienced mentor has blurred the line between right and wrong to an alarming degree, enforcing his own morally compromised code of ethics and street justice. In conclusion, I would like to say that "Training Day" is nothing short of being intense. This is one of Denzel Washington's most frightening performances that I have seen on the big screen in a long time. And I would like to say this: "Denzel, please stick to the good guy roles. I know that this is a major change for you, but pleeeease stick to what you're really good at...and that's bringing out the good in you in any film that you make." "Training Day" is a great DVD addition to any Denzel Washington collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>When a narc Rookie Cop (Ethan Hawke in a Oscar Nominated Role) starts his first day with his first partner (Oscar-Winner:Danzel Washington).

Although, I must point out that the acting was not the only thing this film had going for it.  The plot was spot on, the dialog was tight and Fuqua did such a kick@$$ job directing...he deserved an oscar nod there!  The film follows Alonzo Harris (Washington) as he trains rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke in his BEST performance ever).  The problem is that Alonzo's methods, while effective in their own ways, are not ethical to say the least, and throughout the 24 hour period Jake is subjected to too much, way too much.  One may start to question Alonzo's motives, and rightfully so.  As the film starts to boil down we see Alonzo's true charactor, his inner demons.  This is by far Washingtons best performance, a true gritty and real performance that left me jaw dropped...although he lacked the perfection that Crowe brought to the table with 'A Beautiful Mind'...alas...There are two scenes that prove Washington deserved his nod...his opening scene in the dinner was the best intro of any charactor in so long, it was spot on perfection.  And the scene in the car where he puts the gun to Jake's head and forces him to smoke the weed...he embodies his charactor, mind body and soul.  This is one of the most origional pieces of hollywood history I've ever scene and is well worth the 2 hours spent in front of the screen, thanks to a tightly woven plot, breathtaking direction, perfect dialog and yes, Washington!</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>It's interesting how some of our best actors give some of their best performances playing thoroughly detestable characters.  It's as if they were able to tap into the dark side that lurks inside all of us in varying degrees, and play it to the hilt while enjoying every minute of it.  Richard Gere playing a venal cop in "Internal Affairs".  Ralph Fiennes as a loathsome concentration camp commander in "Schindler's List", and playing the ultimate bad guy as Harry Potter's nemesis Voldemort.  Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre".  And now comes Denzel Washington, usually the squeaky-clean hero of whatever film he's in, giving a bang-up performance as Alonzo Harris, a LAPD detective who is rotten to the core.<br /><br />"Training Day" chronicles one momentous day, from dawn to midnight, in the lives of two cops.  Jake Hoyt is a newly minted detective, anxious to make the grade in Alonzo Harris's elite narcotics squad, who takes "Serve And Protect" seriously.  He rides shotgun with Alonzo for the day.  Alonzo is going to break him in to what being a narcotics detective is about.  But Jake finds out that Alonzo has his own code that has nothing to do with serving or protecting, and everything to do with exploiting the people he's supposed to serve and protect.  He robs the dealers and steals their cash.  He breaks into people's homes with fake warrants.  "I got 'em all under my thumb", he brags about the inhabitants of the Los Angeles ghettos.  We soon realize that Alonzo's superiors have allowed him to do pretty much whatever he wants to do as long as he doesn't embarrass them by getting caught.  But Alonzo has his own problems, which require prompt resolution -- a very expensive weekend in Las Vegas left the Russian mafia into him for one million dollars, payable by midnight if he wants to live to see the dawn, and he's not past doing whatever he has to in order to come up with that sum, including armed robbery and homicide.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke gives the performance of a lifetime as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic, impressionable young detective who very soon realizes he's riding a tiger he may not be able to shake loose.  It can't be like this, he protests to Alonzo. But Alonzo responds, that's how it is; deal with it.  And Jake is left alone to somehow find his way out of this mess and salvage his own integrity in the process.<br /><br />Along with Hawke and Washington, some minor characters give some outstanding performances.  Chief among them are Scott Glen as Roger, Alonzo's erstwhile friend who has something he very much wants; Cliff Curtis, a hitherto unknown Maori actor from New Zealand who gives a devastating performance as Smiley, the Latino thug from the Hillside Trece gang whom Alonzo sets up to waste Jake, once he realizes there is a limit to his venality past which Jake refuses to cross, at which point Jake becomes a liability; Eva Mendes as one of Alonzo's four babymommies, and Cle Sloan as Bone, the South Central gangbanger who makes Alonzo finally realize that maybe he doesn't have them all under his thumb the way he thought he did.<br /><br />The film gets off to a fairly slow start but after the first fifteen minutes it hits warp speed and never lets up.  Antoine Fuqua directed a great movie that is a star vehicle for two outstanding actors.  It's an ugly picture, and we want to protest along with Jake that it can't be this way, but we have to agree with Alonzo that maybe, sometimes, it is.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>I watched this video and first thing I want to say is; The Academy passed up Denzel playing Malcolm X and Rueben "Hurricane"Carter for this?It just goes to show you how the powers that be in Hollywood think. Don't get me wrong, he played the role and all, but I didn't like the character. You got this cop who "trains" this rookie cop who don't know nothing about nothing and gets caught up in this we. When he was coerced to take the drugs, he should have walked and asked for a transfer. But when he gets a beat down from the Latinos,all bets was off then. Basically,this guy wanted to be a good cop, and hooked up with a seasoned cop handling his own personal business on company time and got more than he bargained for in the process. This is one gritty film folks.</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>I'm having a very hard time deciding how to rate this film, but the four-star treatment is the result of balancing its high and low points.  For instance, the overall tone of the film, with its immense amounts of violence and foul language, and completely oppressive sense of hopelessness, is not exactly my idea of a pleasurable motion picture experience.  Still, considering the subject matter, it is appropriate and the filmmakers bring it across quite well.<p>The subject matter is the world of vice cops, and if this tale is to be believed, they're all corrupt.  In fact, not only the vice cops but the heads of several major departments within the LAPD are all lost souls without redeeming graces.  This is a world where evil battles evil, and the prizes are convictions in court and large amounts of cash.  The only real law, however, is the law of the jungle.  This is unrealistic to the point of losing its cred, and is overdone.<p>Denzel Washington earned his Oscar for Best Actor in portraying plainclothes narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who has the task of training young Jake (Ethan Hawke) in the ways of the trade.  Washington does an incredible job of keeping us all guessing as to Alonzo's true nature, as he neatly justifies all of his disgusting and irredeemable actions on the streets, and Jake (and we) continually have to wonder whether to go along with Alonzo or just give up and hate the man.  By the time Alonzo's corruption is fully revealed, Jake, the only character in the entire film with a sense of hope, has had his hope dashed as well as us.<p>All this is beautifully done.  Unlike at least one other reviewer here, I had no problem with the pacing, the dialogue, etc., but found the craft of filmmaking quite well done in most respects.  The major shortcoming for me, other than the overall filth of it all, was a couple of acting performances that really messed things up.<p>One of these is a child actor, a kid who plays Alonzo's son.  This tyke is detached from his world to a completely unbelievable degree, reacting to everyone and everything with absolute boredom, even an extended shootout in his own apartment.  Honestly, the director could have propped up a cardboard cutout of a child and gotten as much out of it.  Even worse is Snoop Dogg, who couldn't lose himself in a character if you drugged, blindfolded, and handcuffed him and parachuted him into the role.  Oh wait, no need to drug this overrated goof.<p>Ultimately this is well worth four stars for its effectiveness and for the performance of Washington, a favorite of mine who is brilliant beyond words in this role.  Still, the tone and content made me feel as if I'd been bathed in a barrel of filthy oil.  I had to take a shower.<p>I will never forget this film, but I never want to see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>"Training Day" may very well be the smartest cop drama in recent history. Denzel Washington gives an Academy Award-winning performance as Alonzo, a hard-edged street cop whose specialty is narcotics. Ethan Hawke plays his rookie of the day who is fresh from training and is green in the field. The film, as the title implies, follows our characters for a day and we see Alonzo do some things we're not sure we want cops doing, such as drinking and driving, stealing money, and taking drugs. While the film's ending is highly predictable and even inevitable, it still leaves a strong impact on the audience. Denzel Washington is completely outstanding as the narcotics detective. This really is a hugely different role for him and he handles it effortlessly, putting him among other film tough-guys like DeNiro, Humphrey Bogart, Al Pacino, and Sean Connery. Washington glows on the screen, steals the show from an already-outstanding cast and flexes those acting muscles like he never has before. Some people questioned his getting the Oscar for this movie. I don't. This is the best performance so far in his career. Director Antoine Fuqua also does a splendid job in keeping the film fluid, fast, and furious. There are touches of humor mixed with scenes of violence. Very rarely does a director really flesh out the surroundings and setting the way Fuqua has done here. "Training Day" is one of the best films of 2001 and shouldn't be missed at all.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good movie and now 10 years might still be a classic.  It is played on many cable channels all the time, but buy or rent it to get the uncut version.(Exception HBO or Cinemax) It will really open your eyes to a different form of justice for a cop that really does not go bad, but takes his arrests to a new level of personal enforcement.  Denzel Washington's character is not necessarily the bad guy but uses very risky tactics to perform his job where no one will tell him differently.  There are many great scenes in this film but the one with Snoop Dog is one of my favorites.  It will be interesting to see the new roles Washington takes up in the future but would be hard to top this one.<br /><br />Peter J.

A good script, yes, perhaps a few too many coincidences; especially about the girl Hawk saves being related to the men Denzel recruits to get rid of Hawk.  The one thing and perhaps the only thing you remember about this is Denzel.  highly, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>From the first 5 minutes till the last minute, I was shocked and gripped at what Alonzo woz forcing Hoyt to do by crossing the fine line of law and justice. I also thought Snoop Dogg's performance woz funny but too short, I really thought Dr. Dre's was excellent he needs an Oscar too. Eva Mendas looks and presence was sexy and lingering. This is the only movie she's nude in.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>It's the day before the Oscars, and I very much needed to rent this film, being a Denzel fan from way back, and I saw A BEAUTIFUL MIND and thought Crowe was swell. It's good to see Denzel playing a baddasss, because, with the exception of "Courage Under Fire", he'd always been maybe just a bit too perfect. This shows range & depth; truly a committed performance. The real star, though, is Ethan Hawke, who never really impressed me before. Putting him up against Denzel's brilliant performance is a true test of acting greatness. I'm sure this type of thing goes on in Police Dept's somewhere, and it's unnerving to think it does; I'm sure production would've been prevented if it hit too many true notes. The film is exciting, suspenseful, and the acting throughout is excellent. The DVD has a crisp 2.35:1 Widescreen, and characters portrayed by Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg are quite fine, proving other areas of talent. I'm impressed with this film, and I think Denzel should win the Oscar, as well as Hawke (though he won't, cuz he's the dark-horse...I hope I'm wrong...) Definitely see this film; it's unsettling and definitely a morality tale (where do you stop bending rules?) I was greatly entertained, and if you're a Denzel or Hawke fan, definitely SEE THIS FILM!!

Washington won an Oscar for his role as Alonzo, a cop gone very, very bad.  Taking the stance that to fight crime, one has to be a criminal, Washington takes us through the paces of a dirty cop who will do anything to achieve his own personal agenda.  What he does to the Sandman is bad enough, but how he sets up his new rookie partner, is abyssmal and out and out vile!  Ethan Hawke is exceedingly good in a role that netted him an oscar nomination as the new rookie who would do anything for his new boss to assure his chances of getting detective ranking.  However, as his training day goes on, Hawke realizes just how corrupt his boss is.<br />The film is slow in the beginning, and by the time it picks up its pace, all I wanted was to see Washington go down.  Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin and Raymond J. Barry are wasted in their roles, but in the extras, we get a deleted scene that really shows what their purpose in the film was.  Why it was taken out is a mystery to me.  The politically correct usage of rappers Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg and the singer Macy Gray continue to show what's wrong with movies these days:  go for the youth market, even though the three above mentioned performers are not actors, and they are only used to up the box office potential.<br />All in all, this is not what one could call an entertaining movie...it's worth lies in the searing performances of Washington and Hawke.  Just once, too, wouldn't it be nice to see the corrupted cop be revealed to the public for what he was? No, again, we find Washington's death (spoiler here? Not really) eulogied as a good cop going down while trying to serve a high risk warrant.  Cover up cover up.....makes one wonder if there's any cop we can trust?  Come on, movie makers, let's show these guys for what they really are, not beautify their deaths.  Especially when those deaths were justified!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There is no denying that `Training Day' is remarkably entertaining and wholly engaging from start to finish.  In fact, this is one of those films that leaves the viewer with baited breath, constantly wrapping us around its tightly woven finger to keep us engaged and engrossed, thoroughly.<br /><br />That said, this is not a film that ages remarkably well.  Yes, it remains entertaining and exciting, but upon reflection it becomes easy to point out the flaws.<br /><br />It isn't as smart as I remembered it being.<br /><br />Still, there is little not to like about this film.  Yes, it is violent and littered with profanities, but if you know anything about this movie then you should know what you are walking into and so you really have no room to complain about those things.  This is a gritty cop movie filled with drugs and gangsters and death; and the trailer alone kind of made that evident.<br /><br />The film follows a rookie cop named Jake as he gets a taste of the job from his new partner, Alonzo Harris.  Alonzo is a rough and tumble cop who is apparently crooked.  The job has hardened him, making him ruthless and corruptible.  Jake has not yet been manipulated by his profession.  He is still green and his naivety makes him an easy (allegedly) target for Alonzo's games.  As their day together escalates, things happen that set off a series of alarms in Jake's head.  This is not going to be your typical day on the job.  As the day draws to a close it becomes apparent that Alonzo has had a lot more than just work on his mind, and soon violence spreads like a plague over this newfound, explosive partnership.<br /><br />For me, this film is intensely edited and directed to capture your interest and hold it firmly in its grip.  Each scene is manipulated in a way to keep us glued.  This is a blessing, but upon reflection it also seems like a curse.  The film dissolves into nothing more than a series of scenes; no real moving plot just exciting moments strung together.  When it does try to form a plot it winds up becoming a tad too far fetched for its own good.  It works solely because of the pacing and the performances.  If left on its own right the film would have fallen apart.<br /><br />Those performances (or the two that matter) are beautifully compatible.  For me, this is easily Ethan Hawkes movie.  So much love and flattery has been showered on Denzel Washington for his performance here, but that is only because it is flashy and baity.  Honestly, Hawke had the harder character to formulate, someone who is suppressed in his own convictions as he observes and reacts to the outlandish behavior of someone he cannot trust yet needs to in order to survive.  He has to make his subtle performance equal Washington's flamboyant one or else he suffers becoming overshadowed and thus forgotten.  I'm so glad he got the Oscar nomination, even if it was in the wrong category (how in the world was he supporting?).  Denzel is very good here, if not a tad over the top.  He nails a lot of scenes (the introduction scene in the diner is still one of my favorite moments in film this entire decade) but he also goes overboard a few times.  He runs that fine line between intense and hammy.<br /><br />Hawke wins.<br /><br />In the end I give this a solid B+.  I still think that the script is the films weakest link.  It has a nice contrast of morality at play here, and it had the potential to really tap into that concept (and it does to a degree) but the overall plot just doesn't stand up on its own.  It works far better as a concept than an actual story.  That said, the fresh take on direction and the solid performances make this a must see film, and one that you will surely enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)<br /><br />The ending was a bit of overkill.  That could be said.  And the mano-a-mano fight before the ending was a bit drawn out.  That too could be said.  But the rest of the film was more than excellent.<br /><br />"Training Day" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few.  Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out.  Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb.  The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender.  (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.)  The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary.  I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares.  There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.<br /><br />Unlike some cop dramas and shoot `em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him.  The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.<br /><br />I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then "led" on the "trip" by someone wanting to exploit them.  Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day.  For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil--and you just found out.  And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of "guidance" you can't refuse.  And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.<br /><br />Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>due to this commenting on this movie<br /><br />i'll put it into 2 words<br /><br />other wise you people would be reading a 3 page worth comment on this move<br /><br />shocking and powerful<br /><br />see this movie<br /><br />it will entertain and shock you from start to end<br /><br />I love this movie<br /><br />and will be watching it as many times as I can over the days, months. it will still be a hit 90 years from now. it sold great at the box office. and I among others love it every time I watch it more<br /><br />also not that you couldn't read that long of a comment<br /><br />I'm A: giving you viewers a break who read my comments<br /><br />and B: resting my typing fingers more<br /><br />plus C: sometimes shorter thoughts give away what you're getting at. and sometimes longer ones help the viewers fully understand. glad I purchased this on dvd</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>I was down the nick with Ray 'contemporaneous notes' Lewis.

The net conclusively proves that when whitey gets up close and personal with Mr African-American, he will pay close attention to the floor. In fact, a mere flick of the wrist is enough. Not so in this Hollywood movie, of course. After getting what can only be described as a comprehensive going over from Denzel Washington for quarter of an hour, you would think Ethan Hawke would be off for an urgent appointment with a life support machine. Eschewing the usual coma, Ethan lives up to his surname by launching himself off a roof straight on the bonnet of Denzel's car. Then with a bone structure last attributed to Reed Richards, he proceeds in his police work seemingly none the worse for wear. The only film worse than this is 'Dark Blue' with a criminal performance from Kurt Russell. As Ray 'contemporaneous notes' Lewis would say: "get your trousers on, you're nicked!"

We've seen plenty of "bad apple" cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place.  Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants.  For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the criminals at their own game, the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.<p>Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner.  Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner.  Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flaunting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves.  Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such "unconventional" actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations.  Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking?  The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.<p>"Training Day" is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting.  The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from.  Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre.  However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness.  This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable.  Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world.  The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us.  However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.<p>As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake.  Washington, generally relegated to "good guy" roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character.  In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer.  Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life.  As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows - or thinks he knows - is right.  These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.<p>Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move. <p>Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), "Training Day" provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie - and much, much finer acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>A rookie, Ethan Hawke, having completed 19 months on the police force decides, with marked trepidation, to join the narcotics unit. He spends a terrible, enlightening, and frightening day under the tutelage of Denzel Washington, who turns out to be a rogue cop who is pursued by the Russian mob, and who they threaten to kill unless he gives them one million dollars. Both Hawke and Washington are splendid in the film, which has a quick-moving plot, lots of drama, and violence. Washington won his second academy award for his acting in this film as a bad person, rather than his usual good guy image.<br /><br />Hawke undergoes many experiences during his day with Washington, including, among much else, being forced to take drugs and alcohol, letting criminals go free, stealing from them, breaking and entering, robbery, and murder. He is almost killed several times.<br /><br />It is interesting to watch Washington violate the system and ignore the interests of people he was sworn to protect and Hawke's reactions to what he sees and participates in.<br /><br />The film has a somewhat obscure ending, leaving us to decide for ourselves exactly how Hawke acted at the end. However the DVD has an alternative ending in which this issue is clear. I liked both endings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

Reviewing his career for a moment, there are many, many outstanding performances. Everything from Easy Rawlins in "Devil In A Blue Dress" to "The Hurricane, "Malcolm X' to "Philadelphia".<br /><br />Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is joining the Narcotics Force of the LAPD. The unit's leader is Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Alonzo gives Jake one day to prove himself worthy of a position on Alonzo's team. Jake is anxious to make Detective and Alonzo promises that after working with him for 18 months, he will become a detective. The day doesn't start well for Jake as Alonzo immediately sets the tone for the whole day and their relationship, defining who is in charge. As the training progresses, Alonzo shows Jake the routine he has set-up and the host of activities he is involved in. Alonzo doesn't walk the straight and narrow and Jake frequently has to come to terms with his own ethics and morals. Jake and Alonzo meet with drug dealers, Alonzo's El Salvadoran mistress, gang members and more, illustrating the fine balance that a detective has to walk. However, the balance has shifted as Alonzo demonstrates to everyone around him who is in charge.<br /><br />"Training Day" written by David Ayer, and directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a powerful film. The film presents an unflinching portrait of life in the LAPD for two cops who are out of the normal routine. I think this is largely the point that Alonzo is trying to get across to Jake. They are not a part of the normal police force and should be allowed to take certain licenses. The conflict arises as Jake holds true to his ethics and morals.<br /><br />Denzel Washington walks a fine line with his portrayal. Alonzo Harris is an unlikable, powerful force unto himself, but he has to be likable, to a certain degree. Washington manages to pull this off by revealing a certain amount of laid back attitude. He jokes with Jake and manages to help alleviate the pressure, at times. Flipping the coin, he also keeps Jake on his feet by immediately creating an air of hostility and uncomfort by bringing him back into Alonzo's reality. The story also sets up a conflict between Alonzo and another group, providing an ongoing level of hostility. As the day progresses, Alonzo becomes more desperate and unhinged as he has to deal with the impending deadline. A very, very good performance by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is also very good. Primarily the straight man to Washington's comic, Hawke reacts to most everything that Washington does. He brings a sense of naivete and innocence to the role balancing that with his previous work as a cop and the fact that he is an adult. It is a good performance that reveals a lot more depth than a superficial `buddy'. As Alonzo continues to throw things at Jake, we see Hawke constantly working through the problems and the situations, quickly, before he makes decisions.<br /><br />As the film depicts two cops working in a rough and violent terrain, the film contains a few scenes of concentrated violence. Their language is also very coarse. As both are used to tell the story, these elements don't bother me, but you should be aware that they are present.<br /><br />Overall, "Training Day" is a very good film, but the conclusion is not as effective as the rest of the film. In a final showdown, Alonzo is confronted with many of the people he previously battled, a sort of showdown. The most obvious person to end the situation walks away leaving Alonzo to confront a group of gang members. The gang members pose a credible threat, with guns at their sides. Who exactly are we supposed to root for in this confrontation? Harris is crooked and dirty, the gang members aren't little angels of virtue either. In a way, this conclusion would present an ironic twist to one of Alonzo's previous statements about the street taking care of the street, but that doesn't happen either. Instead, we have what seems to be a tacked on ending, neatly tying everything up. Personally, I would've preferred an ending that didn't necessarily tie everything up. The cops don't have everything tied up at the end of the day, why should the film?<br /><br />"Training Day" is a very good, very adult entertainment, featuring another great performance by Denzel Washington.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Training Day works because it is pure fantasy masquerading as a reality. The film bends our suspension of disbelief at every moment. We all know that police corruption is a real thing but Lord if a character like Denzel ever walked the street of L.A like that for real he would be dead in a few months. The same goes for Hawke. Both these characters would have a life-span of a Star Trek extra who beams down to the strange planet with the rest of the party.<p>Denzel practically walks and drives the streets like he owns L.A. The man can go down any alley, go into any house, shot up any gang, beat up rapists, steal money, abuse criminals and have some extra debauchery on the side... all before cornflakes. Ethan Hawke is just a way out his depth as a rookie who gives new meaning that that word. A boy playing the donkey to such extremes that the carrot almost brings him to murder 'cause Denzel orders it.<p>What makes Training Day so good is that it blends so much reality with so much fantasy that the line blurs to the point where the two are no longer distinguishable. Then the director Antoine Fuqua can play with us all he likes by having the main protagonist abuse the rookie cop at every given opportunity. We buy it. We buy it all and ask for more. Fuqua then gives it to us by taking the whole police corruption element to new heights as a plot involving bent-cop-drug-dealers become the bait and main meal of the day. They even have totally outrageous names like - The Sandman, but still we think that what we are seeing is reality. Fuqua just has us wearing blinkers all the way as he directs us through the streets of crime with Denzel coming up with some of the most memorable lines in a cop drama ever.<p>The acting is all dark but good. This is a highly enjoyable romp, albeit a totally improbable one, but high-camp stories do not mean high-camp acting. This could well be the B-Movie of cop dramas, but it is just done so well. All the characters are radical and excessive. The plot is almost comic book quality. The ending is totally Hollywood in every department.<p>This is just a great fantasy cop movie that is worthy of repeat viewings. Fuqua is the master of the suspension of the disbelief here. It is very easy to fall victim to what you are seeing is real. Training Day is just salami, but what tasty salami it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>Earning Denzel Washington an Oscar for his bad guy persona, Training Day is an engaging film examining the events of one day in the life of a crooked cop and his innocent prot&eacute;g&eacute;.<p>At the center of the film are the on-the-spot performances of Washington and Ethan Hawke. Clearly the change in role for Denzel energized him profoundly in bringing his bad cop character to life. Though not as celebrated, Hawke is also excellent, portraying an eager Narc in training. These two grab you right in and hold you for the duration of the film.<p>The powerful story, though, is just as absorbing. Without spoiling too much, the corruption that Hawke's character witnesses through the course of the day is shocking and lands him into a situation he may not get out of alive.<p>Though the film at times falls back on some standard movie devices, overall it's fully entertaining and hard to stop watching. It's definitely a character movie to see more then once.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>When I saw this film at the theater, it disturbed me and as a result, I didn't think it was that good.  The disturbing part?  Well, the violence and the language!  But that is an integral part of the movie.<p>When the film later was on cable and I reluctantly watched it, and then watched it again, and again, and again.  I found myself mesmerized each time by the acting, in scene after scene.  Denzel and Nathan were very believable and compelling characters.  The scenes with just Nathan were the most riveting!<p>Though the ending is a canned, quick and furious wrap-up to the story, it is the acting that makes this a memorable piece of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In a city where streets are overrun by drug dealers, those who have sworn to uphold the law are breaking them to clean up the streets. Denzel Washington plays L.A.P.D detective Alonzo Harris, a veteran narcotics officer whose methods of enforcing the law are questionable, if not corrupt. 'Training Day' follows Harris as he trains rookie Jake Hoyt over a period 24 hours. Ethical dilemmas arise for Hoyt as well as the audience as questions present themselves as to whether or not Harris' methodology for ridding the streets of South Central Los Angeles of drugs is right or wrong. Denzel Washington is exceptional. This movie was extremely exciting and very entertaining. One of the best movies I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans when it was released.  I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one "Alonzo" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one "Jake" (Ethan Hawke).<br /><br />This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started.<br /><br />I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>The premiere for this movie had to be postponed due to 9/11. That might have helped, as it did very well in the box office. But still, the horrors of 9/11 gave the film a near-total eclipse. But thanks to strong DVD sales later in the years, it finally gets the recognition it deserves. This is one of Denzel Washington's most memorable performances yet. I'd say his performance in "Malcolm X" is the finest, but here he gets 2nd place as a Los Angeles detective whose mind is more twisted than most. Ethan Hawke is the LAPD police officer who is being evaluated by Denzel; he gives a spectacular performance as well. It's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. The supporting cast (Eva Mendes, Tom Berenger, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, etc.) also do very well in the film. The portrayal of the infamous "South Central" may look a bit exaggerated, but it sure looks real to me.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>'Training Day' is a dark and gritty crime drama that tells a different side of the men in blue. Denzel Washington takes a 180 and plays one vicious and dirty cop who shows a new recruit on his first day as a special teams narcotics officer how his brand of justice works! The film is slick, well paced, full of action and has a semi-plausible storyline. It does go a little Hollywood towards the end, but it's still a very entertaining movie. The film has an small early role featuring Eva Mendes(in her birthday suit!), giving us the money shot! Nice huh? ;-b The DVD transfer is excellent and has some interesting extra material.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I just finished watching it. I always thought Washington was the good man's good actor lacking that nerve and that bulge of testosterone. I thought American Gangster was the first time he did something with a shade of grey. How wrong was I? TRAINING DAY is truly one of the most absorbing, relentless, gutsy, powerful, powerful, upfront and non-boring action/drama movies I've seen.<br /><br />This film truly edges on it's morality. It is in it's own hemisphere. LA or Los Angeles is stunning. I'm tempted to think this is what is like or maybe it's just a film. I know in it's 2 hours - Training Day tried to show a certain half of a cop's life. Maybe all cops are this way and maybe they are not but I'm just left quite speechless at the perfromances.<br /><br />When the film started and the restaraunt scene hit me, I thought OK, This is interesting but soon just about every scene hits you when you're expecting. If someone falls asleep while watching this film, they must be nuts or on McDonalds.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is brilliant. I don't know what happened to the man.<br /><br />The director is someone I've never heard of and I just searched the internet and found he's the same guy who did King Arthur and Tears of the sun. The latter I have not seen and the former's forgettable but I must get around to watching more films featuring the actor, the director and the same genre.<br /><br />I can clearly remember that the last film that shook me up just like training day did was a 2006 film that you clearly remember. And that was called "RUNNING SCARED"<br /><br />I'm not quite sure which one I liked more but that is the magic of the best films. It becomes difficult to compare.<br /><br />To those of you who haven't seen this film as of yet, guys and girls, men and madams......this is it. Look no further.<br /><br />MY Respect.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Training day is a decent movie but Denzel Washington's character Alonzo is what keeps us captivated.  He plays the type of character that if you just had the  television on while you were doing things and Training Day happened to be on and you had never seen it you'd slowly find yourself drawn to the t.v and keep watching as his character grabs you.  I just watched it the other night and I remembered his character having all these cool lines like Samuel L. Jackson's character did in Pulp Fiction from my first viewing but not so much, granted there are some cool lines but it is Washington's delivery of those lines that make them seem so cool, almost like  how comedians say it's all about timing.<br />Other movie characters that come to mind that I feel there character out shined the movie are Kathy Bates in Misery and Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Scorsese's Gangs of New York.  I would also mention Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs but that film is great all around as it showed at Oscar time and matches Hopkins performance.  Each of these characters I mention had strong supporting actors to enhance there performance like a dancing partner who is always there to catch and support the other partner.  Kathy Bates had James Caan and Daniel Day Lewis had Leonardo DiCaprio now Denzel Washington gets his support from Ethan Hawke, who did not get an Oscar win as Washington Deservedly did for his role of Alonzo but did get an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />With 493 reviews of this movie at the time I'm writing this and a good plot synopsis from Amazon there really is no reason to go into any plot detail, just wanted to point out A great movie character made by Denzel Washington and the reason this is a must see for his performance alone.<br /><br />DVD<br />The picture and sound quality of this movie were great, I watched The Good Shepard on HD-DVD after this and Training Day on regular dvd looked possibly more impressive.  So if you have blu ray or hd dvd player and like and have this film and are thinking of upgrading I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: (from back of the dvd)<br />-Behind the scenes documentary hbo first look: The making of Training Day.<br />-Feature length audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua.<br />-Additional Scenes.<br />-Alternate ending (it is pretty interesting giving a little bit more to Jakes day)<br />-2 Music Videos (music from the movie is good if you like hip hop/rap) Nelly's #1 and Pharoahe Monch's Got you<br />-Interactive menus<br />-Theatrical Trailer.

The HD-DVD completely does justice to both the aural and visual aspects of this motion picture.  The soundtrack is very lively and the image captures all the grain and oversaturation perfectly.  Highest marks on this HD-DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>I thought this was going to be a by the numbers thriller.  Wrong on all counts.  It shows the dark side of police work.  I can see how good career vetrans can go bad. The only good companion to this film would be Treat Williams "Prince of the City". That one shows what happens when a officer turns in his partners.  Like "Prince in the City" it offers an uncompromised look at the way incidents are covered up.  That is why this one got the Academy Award.</p></br></body></html>

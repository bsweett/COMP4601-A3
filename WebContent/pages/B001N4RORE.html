I went into Mamma Mia not realizing that it was a jukebox musical for ABBA songs, and I left disappointed.<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with the songs on here - they're catchy and upbeat, if you like that sort of thing - that is, if you like ABBA. If you're not here for the ABBA songs, though, the musical comes off as flimsy and anemic - with several plot points seemingly out of place, largely in order to lead into another ABBA song. Indeed, without the basic understanding that "Mamma Mia" is a jukebox musical, a lot of songs feel strangely out of place - "Honey, Honey", in particular, seems oddly sensual for a young woman to be fantasizing about her mother's lovers. The setting and timeline, too, are badly muddled - the musical takes place in Greece, but "Mamma Mia!" carries Italian overtones, and "Our Last Summer" wistfully places them in France when, to judge from all other plot points, they weren't. Mama mia, but this is very confusing to a viewer not in the know.<br /><br />If you really like ABBA songs, you may enjoy this musical, but I found the soundtrack to be the strongest feature of this movie. The actual plot itself is very flimsy, and often feels like an excuse to rush to the next song. The acting and singing is superb, and the movie is well-cast, but it's hard to hang a meaningful, compelling plot on a handful of catchy dance songs.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />No one is going to mistake Mamma Mia for a terribly good movie, but if you can get past the ridiculously-flimsy excuses for songs and Pierce Brosnan's terrible singing voice, you'll probably have okay time with this well-meaning and inoffensive piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />2.5/4</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>Yep, one of the best James Bonds ever has a major role as one of the Possible Dads in this musical masterpiece - and he does a great job on the songs, folks.<br /><br />The inspired casting is just one of the things that makes this such a delightful experience, and I highly recommend the 2-disc DVD, for the invaluable insights into the production, cast interviews etc.<br /><br />One of the most unbelievable technical achievements is the fact that most of the Greek village is actually a set, inside and out.<br /><br />With a cast that includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters and Colin Firth, the quality is a sure thing, and the screen adaptation by the trinity of women behind original breathtaking stage show is exceptional.<br /><br />Loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>I did enjoy this movie for what it was--a ridiculous, but good, time.<br /><br />The story line is ridiculous, the choreography ridiculous, and the singing, well ... awful.  Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried surprised me, but the rest should have been cast differently.  I know some people just love this movie, but I am not one of them.  I enjoyed it, but more so for the music. ABBA is great, and I know some people won't agree with that, but that's the point: to each their own.  The location was beautiful, as were the costumes.<br /><br />The story, if you have not heard it yet (or scene 30 Rock this season) is: A girl is about to get married, and wants to know who her father is before she does, the problem is she does not know who her dad is.  So she invites the 3 men her mother wrote about in her diary about the time she was conceived.  To her shock, all 3 rsvp to her wedding, and the slap stick, confusing comedy/melodrama ensues.  Fortunately for her, any one of the guys would make a great dad, and they are all willing to play the part.  More slap stick comedy/melodrama ensues until happy twist, and happy ending.<br /><br />It was nice to see this movie once, but I doubt I will seek it out again.  I think I will stick to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001DZO">ABBA - Gold: Greatest Hits</a>... or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0788814958">Muriel's Wedding</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is an international hit musical brought to the silver screen or some sort of Blu-Ray screen. Many screen adoptions fall short of the actual play; yet occasionally they surpass the play because they can show things such as facial expressions and outdoor locations that cannot be seen in a play. Unlike the stage play, this film also is relying on many major actors. Unique and gutsy is the fact that the actors themselves sing the songs.<br /><br />This is definitely a musical. The storyline and dialog are used to glue the songs together. The film is cute entertaining and has a balanced ending where everyone gets what he or she wants, even if he or she does not know what he or she wants. That is what we want.<br /><br />Be sure to view the extras, as it is the extras that add depth to the presentation.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731452">Mars Attacks! ~  Pierce Brosnan</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>"Mamma Mia!" is a light, enjoyable musical story for those in the mood for something like this.  Discovering it on DVD, I immediately thought that the critics were a little hard on the movie when it premiered in theaters.  It's not that they were wrong about some of its shortcomings: Pierce Brosnan's singing is indeed not very good; there's a noticeable overreliance on obvious studio recreations of outdoor sets when they could have just used the actual outdoor sets; and or two other nitpicks.  But any flaws are just that, nitpicks, not fatal elements that should drive a viewer away.  I will say that the movie didn't catch fire up to its full potential, based on all the footage of screaming, joyous fans seeing the stage version that is peppered throughout the special features and promo spots on the DVD, but things are energetic enough.  And several of the secondary characters- especially Meryl Streep's two girlfriends- were a little cartoony for my tastes.  But again, nitpicks.  Just enjoy the scenery, music, and romance.  That's what one wants from a film like "Mamma Mia!", and that's what is enthusiastically delivered.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>Adapted from the hit Broadway play,  MAMMA MIA! is a captivating movie musical that makes you want to sing right along with the Benny Andersson/Bjorn Ulvaeus music and lyrics, based on the songs of Abba.<br /><br />In fact, one of the special features on the DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a Sing-Along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers.<br /><br />Meryl Streep stars as the independently-minded owner of a broken down hotel on a remote island in Greece.  Her about-to-be wed daughter (Amanda Seyfried) does not know the identity of her father, since Mom was being romanced by three guys around the time she was conceived, so the young lady invites all three fellows to her wedding, signing Meryl's name to the invitation.  None of them have any idea that they might be the bride's father.<br /><br />When Meryl sees the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) she just wants them to go away, but Amanda is not about to let that happen in this very fun, joyous musical comedy.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed under the direction of Phyllida Lloyd, MAMMA MIA! has some terrific musical numbers, performed by Streep, Seyfried and Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, who play Meryl's lifelong girl friends.  Ms. Baranski is particularly delightful.<br /><br />The men are not really singers, but they try hard and, truthfully, none of their songs require a strong voice.<br /><br />Director Lloyd supplies audio commentary and there is also a deleted musical number.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Is Meryl Streep perfect in Mamma Mia?  Just about, though everything else carries with it the least little hint of could have been better.  When they announced the movie and said that Olivia Newton John might be playing Donna, we all cheered, and then when it seemed like Michelle Pfeiffer was getting the nod, we were even happier.  Frankly, Meryl Streep gets everything nowadays, can't they give it to someone whose career could use the boost?  But she can sing and of course she can act up a storm.  Donna never seems to think twice about what she is going to the Greek coastline with her enormous tourist hotel and employing all the Greek islanders as her gofers.  How does she pay any of them I wonder, if the business is as bad as she claims?<br /><br />How did Amanda Seyfried get to meet those two bridesmaids who seem to have wandered in from a movie like BLOW-UP--tall, leggy, older supermodels indistinguishable from each other, not a single personality between them.  They just make Sophie look like a midget, can she really be that short?  I used to like Seyfried, but her goofy swoons every time her mother sings are too forced.  I like exuberance, but hers is cooked up like heroin sizzling in a spoon.  And yet, she's not awful, and in fact she does a pretty good job convincing us that she really wants to find out who her father is.  This must speak to a lot of people who don't know their fathers, I guess, but for the rest of us, it is not motivation enough--it is the opposite of motivation--countermotivation perhaps.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic what's his name have chemistry during their big number Lay All Your Love on Me, possibly ABBA's sexiest tune, but otherwise I'm looking at him wondering what the big deal is.  A star of tomorrow, I don't think so.<br /><br />What a missed opportunity for Meryl Streep to have introduced Abba's "JUST LIKE THAT" to the world.  ABBA fans know that "MAMMA MIA" the stage musical actually had a "Just Like That" scene which was trimmed during out of town tryouts.  Here she does a fine job with "The Winner Takes It All," but no one can actually perform that one better than the original by Agnetha Faltskog... maybe Meryl Streep is too levelheaded a person really to put that song over.  Is she ever really down, or does she find a little bit of hope even in her darkest hour?  With Agnetha we knew that everything in the universe was and is and remains doomed, for the gods, cold as ice, throw a dice and decide our fate.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>This is a 2-disc special edition starring Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, extremely talented veteran actors who have starred in many many movies.  I grew up watching musicals, so it was refreshing to see one today.  Although the plot is a tad weak, and many of the songs are not exactly Rogers and Hammerstein, there are good musical numbers throughout the movie with lots of singing and dancing.  Much (or maybe all?) of the music is Abba. I guess I would say that some of the music is great and some is just ok.  Pierce Brosnan (bless his little heart) sings 3 songs.  Now, he is not exactly Mario Lanza but his numbers add to the overall production (and I'll leave it at that.) EVERYBODY sings in this musical, which is great.<br /><br />The movie opens (and continues) with beautiful scenery.  A wee bit of the film (in the beginning) was filmed in London, but most of the production was filmed in Greece, on 2 small islands and on the mainland (Skopelos, Skiathos, and Mouresi-Magnesia).  Raised on the Greek island of Kalokairi by her unmarried mom Donna (Meryl), beautiful and delicate 20-year old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) explains to her girlfriends, Lisa and Ali, how she has always felt "empty" not knowing who her father is. She got her little paws on Donna's diary, and in reading the exciting parts (the "dot, dot, dot" parts), she determines that one of Donna's 3 past boyfriends just HAS to be Daddy.  Let's see--Is it Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Harry (Colin Firth), or Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?<br /><br />Sophie is about to marry Sky (Dominic Cooper), so while Donna is sending out invitations to her best friends, Rosie, the stuff-your-vegetables cookbook writer (Julie Walters) and Tanya, the vixen whose 3rd husband paid for her plastic surgery (Christine Baranski), Sophie sends out some invitations too. Sophie invites Bill, Harry, and Sam!  When Sophie signs Donna's name to the invitations, the guys leave their digs and come to Kalokairi for the wedding.  All the time, the guys are wondering why Donna invited them to her daughter's wedding when they haven't heard from Donna in 20 years. Sophie wants her Daddy to give the bride away at the wedding, so she hides the guys in Donna's villa-hotel, but Donna finds them.  Of course, the plot takes off from here but it is pretty simplistic.  There is not a whole lot more that happens.  As i said before, the attention is more on the music. Chick-flick?  Yeah.  I guess it is.<br /><br />Bonus features include a sing-along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers; a deleted musical number, and a commentary with the director.  Special Edition exclusives are:<br />1) The making of Mamma Mia! the movie;<br />2) Anatomy of a musical number "Lay All Your Love On Me";<br />3) Becoming a Singer;<br />4) Behind the Scenes with Amanda;<br />5) On Location in Greece;<br />6) A Look Inside the Movie;<br />7) "Gimme!

I gave the storyline a 3, because I thought the plot was much too simplistic, realizing though that the director likely put more attention on the musical part of the production.  I gave the music and dancing a 4, because some of the songs were great and some were just ok,  I gave the gorgeous scenery a 5.  The acting while singing deserved a 4 or 5.  I especially liked the feeling that Meryl put into "The Winner Takes It All" scene during her discussion with Pierce right before the wedding, on a cliff in Greece.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear a little Greek music here and there, since they were in Greece (Duh!).  I think I only heard one Greek word in the whole movie (Duh--again). A little unrealistic. But, there was a lot n of singing and dancing, some great numbers, great choreography, many great songs, and sometimes large numbers of townspeople joining in the productions.  I found myself laughing out loud a few times and it was a real feel-good movie--very entertaining. I did enjoy it and would watch it again.  The bonus features were also entertaining.<br /><br />Just DON'T make the same mistake I did!  I watched this movie right before bedtime, so I heard "Dancing Queen" in my head ALL NIGHT LONG!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>Having grown up in the disco era, with ABBA on the radio every ten minutes, I thought this would be an interesting and enjoyable movie.<br />I was wrong.<br />It tried too hard in some places, not enough in others, and plodded along for the most part.<br />The pretense was actually quite the setup for a good comedy. Strong actors was a good move also and the location was great! The unfolding of the plot was weak, at best. And it seemed some of the songs just didn't fit well to what was going on.<br />I'm not sure what I would have done differently here... the story was made to be wrapped around songs by the group ABBA. These songs weren't written for that purpose and therefore the fit just isn't quite right.<br />This is definitely a chick flick and geared for the teen section. Which I'm sure it will win over. Myself?  I watched it and returned it. Don't think I'll watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>Before this movie, the only ABBA songs I knew were Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia and Fernando and thought they were merely a group from the seventies with a few hits and faded into obscurity. And when I bought the soundtrack for my mother for her birthday, I wondered how anybody in they're right mind could construct a musical around the songs of a pop group. So every year, there are movies that I set aside to see when they come out. This, originally, wasn't one of them. But after Indiana Jones, Get Smart, The Dark Knight, and The Mummy (which were all great don't get me wrong) but after all that action, maybe I needed something different. So I went to the theatre, with my mom and sister so as not to feel out of place amongst the miriade of women that would be in attendance, and didn't really expect much. I had the time of my life and this was absolutely one of the most wonderful experiences I ever had at the movies. The cast was amazing: I never saw Meryl Streep in a film before besides her cameo in the god awful Series of Unfortunate Events film adaptation and she astounded me with her voice (especially on her rendition of The Winner Takes It All). Pierce Brosnan was the biggest surprise to me (cause I never imagined a former James Bond being in a musical) but he too had a good singing voice (all of you people who says he can't just shut up and keep your opinions to yourselves. The ones who've criticized him probably have horrible voices themselves and just can't admit it). Her face and voice was familiar but I just couldn't place where I'd seen Christine Baranski before and then I remembered her supporting roles in Addams Family Values and The Grinch. And I couldn't believe that Amanda Seyfried played the dumb girl in Mean Girls so that too was a surprise. All in all it was a movie that made me feel good when I walked out of the theatre (aside from The Dark Knight, something that hardly happens) and the first real musical I've seen (I count The Blues Brothers films but they really aren't a traditional musical when you compare it to this. And its a better musical than any of the trashy, stereotypical High School Musicals).</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>I'm not going to nit-pick like a critic and just express my own opinion of this movie - I loved it! I grew up on ABBA's music as my parents were fans and remember singing and dancing to "Dancing Queen" when I was seven (such memories!). I have loved ABBA ever since, and it was only recently that I actually got to watch the movie (sadly, on DVD, as I missed it during its theater run). Though the actors do not remotely resemble (nor sing like) the singers of ABBA, they more than make up for it with genuine chemistry and camaraderie. A viewer can tell these actors had great fun during the production of this musical/movie and their fun is incredibly infectious! I sang out loud and even danced to the old, familiar, classic songs, and had so much fun! The main cast is made up of famous actors - the incomparable Meryl Streep (who really showcases her beautiful singing voice here), the svelte Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters (I remember her most from her role as Mrs Weasley in the Harry Potter movie franchise), Pierce Brosnan (yes, he does not exactly have a great singing voice, but who cares???), Colin Firth (whose performance as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice left an indelible impression on me), Stellan Skarsgaard, and the two young and talented actors, Amanda Seyfried as Sophie, and Dominic Cooper as her fiance, Sky (the pair are a real-life couple and reportedly began dating on the set of the movie).<br /><br />The story begins with 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan who discovers that any one of three men (Brosnan, Firth, or Skarsgaard) could be her father. Wishing to have her father (Sophie was raised by her mother,Donna played by Meryl Streep) walk her down the aisle at her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper), Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. The clueless Donna invites her two former backup singers to the wedding (Baranski and Walters), and when she sees the three men from her past, all hell breaks loose, and so does the music! The plot is quite thin, and the characters are not explored in-depth here - but the focal point of the movie is the music. The plot revolves around the music, and the lively dance numbers showcase great choreography. The fashion is reminiscent of ABBA's heyday and the costumes are in a riot of colors - all in all, pure rip-roaring fun!<br /><br />This is a fun movie that brings back nostalgic memories. I will be adding this to my DVD collection.Someday, I hope to watch the Broadway musical.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>A bubbly and fun musical with lighthearted songs and great cast.  Who would have thought Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan could carry a tune and put themselves so totally into a lighthearted musical?  It works!<br /><br />If you want something happy and full of energy and jumping dance music it is a good movie to watch.<br /><br />The music is from the Swedish Rock Group, "Abba"  - and although "campy" it is fresh and vibrant again in this romantic scenario.<br /><br />Sophie, a young girl is about to be married.  (Sophie is played by Amanda Seyfried.)  She lives on a beautiful Greek island with her mother, Donna (Streep).  Together they work hard to keep up a run-down resort.  They are preparing for Sophie's wedding and Sophie feels the need to know who her real father is, and wants him with her during this special time.  She had read her mother's diary and there were three possibilities on who her father is.  She invites each to attend her wedding without her mother's knowledge.<br /><br />Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) all arrive on the same boat.<br /><br />Donna finds out they are at her resort and is absolutely shocked to meet her old lovers again after 20 years have patched.  Her two best friends, Tanya (Christine Baranaki) and Rosie (Julia Walters), for their advice and help on how to get through the next few days.  Sophie finds time to be with the three men and looks for clues on who her real dad is.  Again, the unexpected surprise is Streep, Brosman and even Christine Baranski - singing and having fun with this romantic romp.  No matter how schmaltzy Abba can be it is just a "sparkly"  time for all.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Admit it -- somewhere in the darkest and most guarded place in your hearts, you like ABBA. Maybe just a little bit, but you do. The Swedish group's music was a perfect complement to the 1970s disco era -- mindless, pleasure-oriented, saccharine and highly melodic. "Mamma Mia" stitches together ABBA's greatest hit (and a few more) into a fun and sometimes funny musical experience. The plot is silly and contrived -- a hippy girl's daughter is getting married and wants to invite her Dad to the nuptials. The singing -- done by the principals themselves, including Meryl Streep -- is mostly good, with the exception of poor Pierce Brosnan's forced efforts at song. The ABBA tunes more or less, kind of, almost fit the action. But the star of the movie, as far as I was concerned, was the terrific movement and lighting -- dancing, running, leaping glory bathed in Mediterranean light and Greek aesthetic. Cute story, fine music, but a delight for the eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>Hmm...will you like this video?<br /><br />Here's a quiz:<br />1) Are you a fan of ABBA?<br />2) Do you like movie musicals?<br />3) Do you like romantic comedies?<br />4) Do you like Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, and/or some combination thereof?<br /><br />Here are the results:<br />1) If you can't stand the music of ABBA, move on...skip this movie, do not buy, (also do not pass "GO" do not collect $200).<br />2) If you answered YES to question #1 and at least one of the other questions, add this DVD to your collection.  You will watch it occasionaly, and enjoy it thoroughly each time.<br />3) If you answered YES to at least two of the other questions, you MUST get this DVD.  You will love it, and you will most likely watch it repeatedly.<br /><br />I found this movie to be great fun!  ABBA was at their apex of popularity when I was in college, and hearing this music brought back fun memories.  I thought that the director, writers, choreographers, and sound engineers did a grand job of synchronizing the music, dance, and storyline.<br /><br />The setting for the film is exotic.  The storyline is interesting, and the acting is engaging and fun.  The singing is good for the most part, though my HS aged drama-choir kids seem to gain a sort of pleasure from mocking Pierce Brosnan's solos.  Granted, his solos are probably the weakest link in the show.  On the other hand, I loved it when Meryl Streep's character and her two best friends sang at her daughter's bachelorette party.<br /><br />The story is almost melodramatic, and the main characters pull off their roles well.  The music and dancing is fun, and if you enjoy that sort of thing, then you will definitely enjoy this show<br /><br />4 stars!  "Thank you for the music"!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>I hadn't intended to waste time watching this. (Meryl Streep in a musical? Gimme a break.) But my wife wanted to see it so I joined her. And I have to say I was more or less pleasantly surprised. No one had told me this was the "ABBA musical." The plot, as befits a musical, is pretty simple. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of an American hotel-owner on one of the Greek islands, is about to be married. Her mother, Donna (Streep), was a hippie chick back in her youth, sleeping with whomever she liked whenever she pleased, and when she got pregnant her own parents barred her from returning. She's not even sure which of three different guys is the baby's father. But Sophie has found mama's diary and culled the three names, and has invited all three now middle-aged potential fathers to the wedding. So Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgaard turn up and the games begin. It's all lighthearted and fun, but the real enjoyment for me was in the fact that every single number is an old ABBA tune, from "Chiquita" and "Slipping through My Fingers" through the boisterous production number, "Dancing Queen." It's also a relief to know that even I am a better singer than Pierce Brosnan. There's not a lot of the actor-character chemistry necessary to hold a successful musical together (think John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John), but it's worth watching for the music. Once, anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Mamma Mia! The Movie"  is based on the long-running Broadway play.  Its thin plot was conceived to tie together a catalogue of ABBA songs.  Donna (Meryl Streep) is an independent, single mother who owns a small hotel on a picture-perfect Greek island.  Her daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), is about to be married and Donna has invited to the wedding two lifelong friends from her one-time singing group, Donna and the Dynamos -- multi-divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski) and practical, no-nonsense Rosie (Julie Walters).  Sophie has secretly invited three guests of her own.  Longing to discover the identity of her father so he can walk her down the aisle, she brings back three men from Donna's past to the Mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier -- Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam (Pierce Brosnan), and Harry (Colin Firth).<br /> Streep's Donna is far afield from any role the actress has played before.  It's light, almost buoyant, as Donna sings her heart out, dances on a pier, or looks mortified when she meets her three beaus from decades past.  The songs by ABBA include "Dancing Queen," "S.O.S.," "Take a Chance on Me," and "Money, Money, Money."  When you finish watching the film, the songs will remain in your head for hours, if not days.  You'll have to decide if that's a good or a bad thing.  Both Baranski, with her trademark deadpan delivery, and Walters, with take-no-prisoners energy, provide ample comic relief.  The two-disc Special Edition contains a making-of documentary, a detailed featurette on the staging of one musical number ("Lay All Your Love On Me"), a music video, deleted scenes and outtakes, and a digital copy of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>I've said this before, elsewhere: I am a manly man. But, occasionally, even manly men are cowed by their better halves. So one day I was "convinced" to sit down and watch this film. And, because even manly men can channel their more refined dimensions (and without forfeiting their man card), I ended up digging MAMMA MIA and, dammit, even humming some of these Abba songs!<br /><br />The set-up goes like this: It's just before Sophie's wedding, and preparations are lively. But there's just one thing missing to make it all perfect: her father to give her away. All her life, Sophie had gone on, not knowing who her dad is. But then she stumbles upon her mother Donna's diary and discovers that her dad could be one of three possible men. All with whom, the diary states, her mother had spent time, with one thing leading to another, and dot dot dot... Unbeknownst to Donna, Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. And, then, fun shenanigans.<br /><br />For those who've signed up for FeelGoodology 101, know that the first thing the professor does in class is pop in this DVD. Say what you will about MAMMA MIA, kibitz about the campy elements or grouse that some or most of the cast can't carry a tune, but that doesn't alter the fact that this musical simply makes you feel good. I've never seen Meryl Streep in a role like this, which just goes to show that the woman can officially do anything in the acting gig. Pierce Brosnan, no, he can't sing, but so what? He, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard come in with good humor and grace. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is so damn engaging and so hopefully wistful that she's the perfect choice to open the movie with, because her plight immediately draws you into the story. And she can sing. Her vibrant rendition of "Honey Honey" is an exercise in exuberance and catchiness. It may be my favorite song, up there with "Chiqitita," "Take a Chance on Me" and "Dancing Queen," this last one to which I, thankfully, managed to abstain from humming along (for I am a manly man and not some disco dude).<br /><br />There's not much here that's rooted in reality, and it's fine. Every now and then, this type of film is exactly what I'm looking for, especially when one's down in the dumps. MAMMA MIA is a fable, full of warmth and great energy and vivid colors. It's set on a stunning Greek island and boasts its very own spirited Greek chorus, which does just fine going into backup singers mode. You get the happy ending that was never in doubt. And, instead of one Prince Charming, the movie presents three.<br /><br />What I've got is the single disc DVD. Its special features include lukewarm audio commentary by Director Phyllida Lloyd (who also directed the stage productions of MAMMA MIA) and the deleted musical number "The Name of the Game." And, ooooh, there's an option to play the movie with on-screen lyrics for the musical numbers! And an option to skip right to a song. Score, baby!<br /><br />Okay. And now I'm gonna watch some football (please don't take away my man card).</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>In order to enjoy this movie, you should be a fan or at least like ABBA's songs because the whole Mamma Mia's idea is just an excuse for letting the grateful viewers/listeners experience their favorite songs in a relaxing and feeling good setting on a colorful sunny idyllic Greek isle surrounded by the bluest sea you can imagine. I consider myself a loyal ABBA's fan. I still remember how I heard their songs for the first time almost thirty years ago, how happy I was to be able to own their albums on LPs, how much I enjoyed ABBA: The Movie (1977) which came to Moscow in the beginning of the 1980s and was basically the record of their concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. I also saw the famous musical Mamma Mia on which the last year movie is based on and I liked it a lot. It would not hurt if you can take with humor outrageous psychedelic outfits of the 1970s and the tight boots with the platforms so huge that it makes your feet hurt just to look at them. If that sounds like your idea of fun, fun you'll have. I sure did, at least for the first hour or to be precise until the very moment, Pierce Brosnan had ruined my favorite ABBA's song S.O.S by attempting to sing it. I guess it is sometimes easier to save the world from all sorts of evil than just to sing a song. While that torture lasted, I kept repeating instead of S.O.S, S.O.E which means Save Our Ears. I later found out that when asked during an interview why he took the role, Brosnan replied that when he heard from his agent, "Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep", he took it without asking whom he'd play. Well, acting next to Streep is a great reason, and I believe Brosnan had a lot of fun sharing the screen with her. I also believe that there is nothing impossible for Meryl. She can play anything and anybody. Just to think what she has done in all the movies she has graced with her presence. She did very convincing accents, she learned how to play a violin, she dances, she has been a villain and a saint, and everybody in between and she's been always the reason to watch any movie. While watching Mamma Mia, I got the crazy idea. What if Meryl played all six older characters, Donna, her two girlfriends and three men from her past? I know it sounds weird but if Eddie Murphy could do it, I am sure Meryl Streep could act and sing for six characters and she would be simply fabulous. Between Streep and young talented Amanda Seyfried, two of them made a nice singing/acting team. But even with Meryl playing and singing only one part, the film is still entertaining and fun mostly due to the fact that everyone involved had a good time on the charming little island, the serious actors were not afraid to make fools out of themselves for all of us to enjoy, and in the end everyone was happy and got what they wanted even if it was not exactly what they wanted in the beginning of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I ignored this film when it came out in theaters; just didn't interest me.  I vaguely wondered why an actress of Meryl Streep's caliber would stoop to take such a silly role.<br /><br />Then one frozen day I made it out of my house to the library and picked up some DVD's to help me make it through the week.  After several sub-zero nights and frozen pipes I was in the mood for something that looked warm and sunny.  The picture on the cover of the DVD was ridiculous but at least they appeared to be dancing on a beach in front of blue water.<br /><br />Wow!  It didn't take long for the warmth in this film to melt my mid-winter depression.  I didn't see the stage version so I wasn't handicapped by making that comparison.  And I never liked ABBA so I didn't care if anyone mangled their songs.<br /><br />I admit that I had soured on Meryl Streep, after having been a major fan.  She seemed to have become so mannered and self conscious that I lost interest in her.  But here....another WOW!<br />This and her performance as Julia Child have reinstated her into my personal fan club.  She is just so filled with life!  If anyone is willing to suspend belief in the credibility of the script, and just go along with the sheer exuberance of the film, they can have a great time.<br /><br />True, there are lots of "flaws" for the serious film goer which is probaly why critics didn't like it.  Besides a silly story, the casting is somewhat strange, especially the three men.  Colin Firth, whom I adored in so many roles, is awkward and looks embarrased for most of the film.  But that is his character!  And I give him credit for putting himself in such an embarrasing position.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan is good as the aging cute guy who can't sing but gives it a try.  He is losing his looks but that's good for the role, too.  He's just a guy who made a mistake and has paid for it and now is getting another chance.  The Swedish fellow seemed well cast.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried was perfect as the prettiest little gumdrop of a girl you'd ever want to see in a movie.  She was more than a pretty face, too, she acted very well.  The scene where Streep prepares her for her wedding brought tears to my eyes.  Christine Baranski, an actress I never liked, was terrific here.  I loved the bit where she has an almost-romance with an adorable young Black barboy.  Julie Walters was terrific, too.  I was glad to see that each of them had a chance to shine.  The numbers with the three of them performing were wonderful!  So much energy, so much joy!<br /><br />I can see now why Streep and the rest chose to make this less-than-Oscar-worthy film---for the sheer fun of it!  It really comes across.  A really good time awaits anyone who can open up to sheer, mindless enjoyment.  Intellectual snobs better pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>No wonder people are raving over this film!!! It's a musical for sure. It's a comedy--part of the time. It's dramatic--some of the time. And it is entertaining ALL of the time! I laughed! I cried! I cheered! I sang! I love this film--and the best part was Meryl Streep dancing and singing in all parts--whether as part of the story or in her trio.<br /><br />Everyone was delightful in his/her role. It is true--the singers are not trained professionals--they are more like real people singing in real situations. OK, most people don't blurt out in song, but wouldn't you rather have Meryl sing her own songs than have her lip sync as Audrey Hepburn did in "My Fair Lady?"<br /><br />Or to see and hear Pierce Brosnan sing so painfully in his role? His struggle lent credence to his role as a once-heartbroken young man who finds himself 20 years later in a place make amends. His singing was sweet and heartfelt.<br /><br />Or Julie Waters' show-stopping number toward the end of the film. "Take a Chance on Me!" Indeed! Or the concept of the Greek chorus (you get it?!!)--Greek chorus, made up of local villagers in just the right places for the numbers. Especially the women following Meryl/Donna scene.<br /><br />Mamma Mia--my mamma is known, but who is my dad? Sophie finds her mother's journal the summer she was conceived only to learn that her dad could be one of three men. How this is resolved is one of the great moments of the movie. It's a Greek wedding under the summer sun with a touch of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream of magic and confusion. As in the Bard's play things are set back in order, maybe a new order by movie's end.<br /><br />To get there the viewer will experience a brouhaha of ABBA melodies (the musical is based on their hits) rousing, funny, and serious. When Meryl/Donna sings to Pierce just before the wedding, my heart broke with hers. Wow, that was as powerful a scene as anything she's done dramatically in other roles.<br /><br />But enough. I want to finish watching the Feature Commentary in which Director Phyllida Lloyd explains each scene: where, how, purpose. I must confess that I didn't know outdoor scenes are often shot in studio simulations.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, I am in the Camp of "Mamma Mia!" enthusiasts. This is Review #178.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>I like musicals.  There I've said it.  Someone will surely come by and take my 'man' card for having said so, but I don't care.  I'm man enough to admit that I actually enjoy musicals.  At least in most cases I do.  With Mamma Mia!, at least the movie version (as found on Blu-ray and DVD), well, not so much.<br /><br />Mamma Mia! has been 'a worldwide phenomenon' for as long as I can remember... going back to TV ads blaring for the broadway type show.  Not quite as far back as the days when the band that the music came from was making music, but still for quite a long time.  Inspired by the music of ABBA (sorry, I can't make the backwards B character there), Mamma Mia! uses many of those songs to provide the sound track and even dialogue for a story about a daughter that is getting married, from a single mother who isn't sure which of 3 men fathered that daughter during a magical year many years ago.<br /><br />As a story Mamma Mia! is entertaining enough, and the actors in the film actually do well with their roles except.... well, except for the fact that they have to sing and need to be convincing enough to not have viewers feeling that they're watching a bunch of lip syncing.  It is in this area that Mamma Mia! fails for me, thanks to singing that seems out of sync with the songs that I remember, and worse, thanks to singing from an actor or two that were cast in the film who frankly shouldn't be allowed to sing at all.<br /><br />As a singer, lets just say that Pierce Brosnan shouldn't consider changing his line of work.  It may not be totally horrible, but it's enough to make you wish that Brosnan was busy working on a Bond film or something similar.<br /><br />Meryl Streep does ok with her vocal stylings, but again the pace of some of the singing she does just seems completely off when compared to the radio played songs that they were taken from.<br /><br />Watch this if you feel inspired to, but think carefully before purchase.  For as much 'fun' as this is supposed to be, you may find yourself regretting a purchase and wishing you rented instead.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>You all know the cast is All-Star. The fact that they all sing their own parts with no `Ghost Singers' makes this romp based on Abba songs all the better. And by the way, Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski can sing, and I mean very very well.<br /><br />The music, the scenery, the scenarios...all very excellent. And people, every actor/actress here can SING. While some think the `Dancing Queen' sequence is great, I think the Dancing Guys In Flippers (only 30 seconds long) is hilarious.<br /><br />The choreography is superb. The music is great, and the whole thing is just fun.<br /><br />The plot? Simple. A young girl invites three men (Firth, Brosnan, and Skarsgard) who are totally different, to her wedding. One of them, she believes, is her father. Her mother (Streep) had `encounters' with each. And each man, in return, believes himself to be the daughter he never knew of. Because of this, each man is transformed. Simple, and enough of the plot.<br /><br />The movie is about the incredible music and dance sequences. Enjoy this film for that simple fact. I know I did.<br /><br />And by the way, the movie is freaking funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I avoided seeing this film for a long time because, in the late 70's, I was over-saturated with ABBA. Being somewhat of a film aficianado, I've come to believe that Meryl Streep is among the finest of actresses...ever. I had to check out her musical romp, and I wasn't disappointed. Everyone knows she has a great voice (Postcards from the Edge, Ironweed) and I'm surprised she hasn't been used in other musical endeavors. Regardless, I enjoyed "Mamma Mia!" a lot; a sweet love story centering around middle'aged types. How refreshing. I was entertained a lot, and if you weren't, maybe you should lighten up a bit. I enjoyed the entire cast of old pros, and also the lovely Amanda Seyfried as the catalyst of all the silliness that ensues. It's so silly, but I applaud the film for its unrelenting energy. Kick back, have popcorn and beverages of choice, and enjoy this attempt to bring back the exhuberant musical style that hasn't been successful since "Grease" (1978) or "Hair" (1979). Meryl Streep really shines, once again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"Mamma Mia! The Movie", the film adaptation from the jukebox musical by British playwright Catherine Johnson and featuring the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus (both the male members of the group).  In 1999, the musical has brought in over $2.0 billion in earnings (becoming the highest grossing musical of all time)and what better than to have a film adaptation a decade later.<br /><br />With Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson producing the film, "Mamma Mia! The Movie" would be directed by British director Phyllida Lloyd and a screenplay by Catherine Johnson.  The film adaptation would feature an all-star cast starring Meryl Streep ("Kramer vs. Kramer", "Adaptation", "The Devil Wears Prada"), Pierce Brosnan (James Bond 007 films, "The Thomas Crown Affair"), Colin Firth ("The English Patient", "Pride and Prejudice", "Shakespeare in Love"), Stellan Skarsgard ("Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End", "Beowulf and Grendel", "Dogville), Julie Walters (Harry Potter films, "Becoming Jane", "Billy Elliot) and Christine Baranski ("Happy Family", "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", "Chicago") and a film that would jumpstart the careers of Amanda Seyfried ("Mean Girls", "Veronica Mars") and Dominic Cooper ("The Duchess").<br /><br />The film which cost $52 million would earn over $609 million worldwide in the box office making the film one of the top 50 highest grossing films of all time and the distinction of the highest grossing movie musical in the world.<br /><br />"Mamma Mia!

The Movie" is presented in 1080p High-Definition (Widescreen 2:40:1).  "Mama Mia! The Movie" is quite interesting presentation.  For one, the film is shot in Greece and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  But there is also an artistic element that cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos brought to the film (Director Phyllida Lloyd goes more into wanting a dramatical effect for the film through experimental shooting during day and night).  From scenes overlooking the ocean at night with the beautiful black and blues, to the shots of the wedding as lights are seen going up to the church area.  Absolute beautiful!<br /><br />But it's also important to note that Zambarloukos went with colors that are high in contrast at times and colors that may seem a bit oversaturated  at times but for the most part, it added to the vibrancy of the film  and looks incredible on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Mamma Mia! The Movie" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and comes clear from the front and center channels but the film is obviously going to be musically driven and one is not going to hear an aggressive soundtrack.  Music sounds good but not great as the lossless soundtrack is not as immersive as I would have wanted it to be.  I didn't notice the surround or rear channels being utilized throughout the film.  So, it would have been great if the mix would have incorporated those channels.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Mamma Mia!

The Movie" since "Grease".  I absolutely felt that Amanda Seyfried shined throughout this film.  Seyfried is absolutely radiant in this fim and since the theatrical release of "Mamma Mia! The Movie", I have been quite impressed by her work.  She's an amazing actress with so much depth and she shows what she is capable of in "Mamma Mia!", definitely far from what we have seen of her in "Mean Girls" and "Veronica Mars".<br /><br />And Meryl Streep, what a brilliant performance.  It's one thing for Streep to be known as a wonderful award winning actress but somehow there was this synergy that went through the cast and but especially for Meryl Streep, she was electrifying and had so much energy, I was impressed.<br /><br />The cast was absolutely fun to watch and although some of the talent (specifically the male talent) are not known for singing, I suppose the film brought this naturalness to its characters.<br /><br />But it all comes down to the music of ABBA, especially if you enjoyed their music in the past.  For me, it was nostalgic as I grew up during the '70s and my parents were part of those disco years and part of my younger life was at home with plenty of people taking part in these disco parties.  So, the music of ABBA didn't bother me and in some ways, some songs really got me interested in how the original music sounds compared to the movie musical and songs such as "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!" surprised me because I thought the music was first created for Madonna's 2005 song "Hung Up".<br /><br />But there is so many things that came together for this film that I absolutely enjoyed.  The location was absolutely beautiful, the editing that helped enhance the musical numbers were well-done and as mentioned, the talents were just enjoyable to watch.  This was an enjoyable film that didn't require any seriousness or surrealistic plot, this was a straight-forward fun, vibrant film with an enjoyable cast.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, there are people who enjoy musicals and I know the music of ABBA and disco may be a bit much for some people expecting something along a similar path of movie musicals such as "Moulin Rouge", "Chicago" or "Nine" but "Mamma Mia! The Movie" is a film about having fun and being in love, and I suppose once can say that ABBA's music embodies that.  This is a gorgeous movie on Blu-ray and some may feel the film was too oversaturated for their taste but I felt that there was a sense of artistry in terms of cinematography.<br /><br />Overall, "Mamma Mia! The Movie" is a wonderful musical on Blu-ray and if you are into musicals, especially the music of ABBA and want something more lively and fun, definitely give this Blu-ray release a try!

Knowing I had seen the play on Broadway three times and once in Toronto, it was no surprise that "Momma Mia," the DVD was behind the decorative Christmas paper. "Oh, can we watch it, Uncle Ed?" (If ever a gift could keep on giving right back to the givers)!<br /><br />Even though Meryl Streep is old enough to be a grandmother (and probably is), the camera never gets too close to her face, as she plays a barely middle-aged mother of a love-struck daughter on the verge of marriage. The daughter discovers that Mom was a bit wilder in her youth having made love to three men at approximately the same time. The plot unfolds when she decides to invite her "fathers" to the wedding without her mother's knowledge. MOMMA MIA!<br /><br />This is loosely based on a late 60's movie titled "Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell," where the twist is that Gina Lollabrigitta tells three American World War II veterans that they are the father of her son. Their guilt and money provide for the same. Only here, the setting is an unnamed Greek isle instead of Italy, and mom is barely scraping by running what can be charitably called an inn.<br /><br />An unabashed ABBA fan, I enjoy each hit over and over again, and could play them all day. I play them when I am in a good mood, and when I need to get in a good mood. The music from this can be found on the CD for the movie (d'uh), or ABBA Gold, which has every one but, "I do."<br /><br />So, love me or leave me, but please don't deceive me, because I won't deceive you. Meryl Streep reveals her absolute depth in her performance. Her ending with her co-stars is a triumph of harmony on stage or at Waterloo where Napoleon did surrender. Pierce Brosnan's bellowing efforts might make you want to suck on a lemon while someone is running steel fingernails across a blackboard, but the movie is fun even in a rich man's world, or for a super trouper. The supporting cast was superb. I was particularly impressed with Julie Walters who played one of Meryl Streep's adult sidekicks. Christine Baranski was predictably good. I never imagined that Stellan Skaarsgard could kick up a storm the way he did.<br /><br />My gift included a trailer that allowed the viewer to see the making of the movie, and the songs being replayed in the movie with the words appearing, but without the bouncing ball. It helped me learn a lot of the correct words that men seem to have a harder time identifying them than women do when it comes to song. (Up to age 50, I thought Popeye was strong to the "pinach" cuz I eats me spinach).<br /><br />Do I recommend this DVD? I ask in all honesty, without a song or dance what are we? So I say thank you for the music, (and the DVD,) for giving it to me. Just remember there is no comparison between this and what you would see on Broadway, in Toronto or Peoria at Route 24, Junction 8, for that matter. The movie could only leave you disappointed. It is entertaining especially if you are forgiving of Streep and Brosnan not being singers.<br /><br />Thank you, Christian, Gabriella, Samuel Adam, and Emmanuel.<br /><br />Uncle Ed<br /><br />For Barrie Bracken.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>I really dredded having to watch "Mamma Mia." I heard alot of bad reviews,even my Sister hated the film,but it did make alot of money,so I knew someone liked it.<br />After seeing the movie I didn't like it either,I LOVED IT.<br />First of all,Meryl Streep can do ANYTHING.If she's in a movie,you know it has to be great.She can sing and dance like there's no tommow.<br />Its wonderfull seeing actors over 50 singing and dancing,and having fun for once in a movie.Most films have actors over 50 in the background,this one has them featured.<br /> Amanda Seyfried  has the best singing voice,and she's wonderfull in the film,but Pierce Brosnan takes alittle getting use to,but he gives it his best.<br />"Mamma Mia"is a Musical Classic  I look forward to watching again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>I was astrongly encouraged to watch this movie, and having done so, am not sure if it was marriage counseling, a window into post-menopausal joy, a means of seeing into the hearts of the dedicated men and women of the intelligence community who choose to become "celibate chiefs" or "iron maidens" lamenting lost joys, or a mix of all three but I can testify as to its value in all three.<br /><br />Suffice to say that my 13 year old son nailed it when he heard I was going to watch it:  "Dad, you will love it or hate it."  Well, I loved it, and judging by the reviews there are a lot of folks who hate it, so mark me down as a strong five.<br /><br />This movie grabbed me so tightly I spent half the time standing five feet in front of the screen, not content to watch from across the family room.  It brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion, and most especially as it reached the cresendo of discovery and shared emotions among the three dads (one of whom emerges as the last man standing), the young couple, and the star of the movie, a vampish Meryl Streep whose eye make-up alone made her a completely different person, a truly remarkable touch of art.<br /><br />The two "mature" female supporting actresses were spectacular, and the young actress featured is going to be seen again.  Tom Hanks was involved in this movie as an executive producer, and overall, I could not find a single disappointment in this movie.<br /><br />The cheoreography and imagination--for example, all the men in the cast dancing down the pier in flippers--is great, and over-all this movie hangs together very well.<br /><br />The singing was fine and not the centerpiece for for one who loves musicial, more than enough to check that box--the producers do avery fine job of balancing actual singing "live" and studio singing overlain for the longer pieces.  The words mattered, and I can see how a cult might develop around this movie and the songs from the one group that is featured.  The scenery was spectacular and although not a central aspect of the script, breathtaking as a supporting element.<br /><br />Anyone that is a romantic and loves musical should buy this rather than renting--as some other reviewers have noted, this is one of those movies you can watch multiple times, always notice something new, and never tire of having it on.<br /><br />Other romance musicals that I have:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY">De-Lovely</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094ARN2">Beyond the Sea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094AS9U">Bride and Prejudice</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8QVWY">Walk the Line (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630522577X">My Fair Lady</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04OM">The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GBEWHA">Grease (Rockin' Rydell Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AM6IY">West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04NI">Oklahoma!

The story revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a 20-year-old girl about to tie the knot on the beautiful island she resides on with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie has no idea who who father is (neither does Donna, for that matter), so she invites the three possible candidates (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding in hopes of reuniting with her true paterfamilias. Needless to say, Donna isn't exactly thrilled when three of her former lovers show up unexpectedly on the eve of her daughter's wedding, and of course hilarious hijinks ensue, followed by a totally unrealistic yet ridiculously happy ending.<br /><br />The best part of this film is watching some of my favorite Hollywood actors sing and dance like crazy. Some of them (Streep, Seyfried, Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters) are quite impressive, while others (pretty much all of the guys) are not. Also, I have no idea where this movie was filmed, but it's absolutely gorgeous and I totally want to go there!<br /><br />Overall, "Mamma Mia" is a fun little movie to watch, although I doubt I'll ever watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Mama Mia" is an entertaining fluffy, fizzy flick that will certainly not tax your brain. I've seen it three times on stage so was prepped for the movie version. It was fun to watch the way they movie-masters opened up the stage version to the panoramic natural setting of the beautiful Greek islands although the expansiveness didn't always click. Originally the musical's creators took some catchy Abba songs and wove them together into a plot-line that was above-average or more sophisticated than is usual when musical-makers start with a canon of songs.<br /> In Blu-Ray the Greek island settings are gorgeous. Meryl Streep is exceptionally good in this version as is Pierce Brosnan. Neither one comes over very well in the CD soundtrack when you can't see them acting because their voices can't carry the day alone. The entire cast does a creditable job.<br />Some of the musical numbers are way over-produced and over-peopled. Less would have been better. The early number "Money, Money, Money" is way over the top. The yacht scenes bear no reference to the island life and are a phony dream sequence. Some numbers are hectic, frenetic and seem like they're filmed in fast motion. There are too many extras bouncing up and down to the Abba beat and overpopulating the screen. Too many Greek peasant women and armies of dancers come advancing off the screen and into your lap. Everyone is dancing their hearts away.<br />Audiences unused to the unreality of the old-fashioned movie musicals are going to be overwhelmed by the overkill. We have forgotten how to suspend disbelief when it comes to the openness of musicals. Breaking into song has become bizarre for those unused to the old genre.<br />Meryl Streep uses her particular acting skills to put over certain numbers particularly "The Winner Takes It All."<br />It seems foolish to quibble about a movie that has a lot of laughs, burlesque turns, snappy popsicle music, a pretty good plot, and keeps you entertained.<br />The movie has a vitality, a joie de vivre that is certainly good for these hard economic times. Just don't expect Sondheim or Leonard Bernstein. The DVD is crammed with extra features for those who have the time. This is a movie for those who crave sheer exuberance.</p></br><a href="../users/AKMEY1BSHSDG7.html">AKMEY1BSHSDG7</a><br/><p>I love this movie! I love every second of it! It's not just the film, itself, or the music, or the actors, or the scenery...<br /><br />It's the experience of seeing it with friends who share in the fun of it all. When was the last time you went to the movies and heard at least half the audience singing along and applauding like mad?<br /><br />Mamma Mia! is virtually a TRIBAL experience! Enjoy the adventure!</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>I know this review will be an unpopular one, so I am prepared for the many "not helpful" votes this will get.  Take your best shot.  That being said ...<br /><br />Yikes.  I have always been a Streep fan, but I have never seen anything like this.  I don't know what they did to her, but throughout most of this film - I will blame the director, choreographer and editors - she is so manically jubilant and expressive and hyper-active that I was afraid the poor woman had developed an addiction to chrystal meth!<br /><br />In fact, most of the cast fairs poorly.  Only Julie Walters seems to realize that she is in the midst of one enormous joke.  For all the mania and energy forced upon these people, their dealiest flaw is that they seem to be taking this whole story seriously.<br /><br />The term "Greek Chorus" has never been so horrifyingly real.  Words cannot express.<br /><br />Two stars though because I can see a future rainy Sunday with tequila shots lined up on the coffee table, a double feature of Mama Mia! and Can't Stop the Music, and a really big headache afterward. Now that's fun!.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>There's a lot to like in this movie. It has Amanda Seyfried looking like a younger and cuter Cameron Diaz. Then there's the chick-lit comedy that she leads (or tries to), about strange family secrets emerging on the eve of her wedding. Throw in Abba's bouncy music, likeable again now that the disco era is fading from memory. Then add Meryl Streep in a physically comedic role, with Pierce Brosnan and lots of others pulling their weight. You already know that it's going to end up OK - not just in the romantic plot, but as a movie, too.<br /><br />Lots more makes it work, as well. The ongoing visual gag of the "Greek chorus" never palls. A few points really stood out, like the bachelor party descending on the bachelorette party, merging them both into some neo-primitive fertility rite (clothes on, if it matters). But Streep and her co-stars really made this movie. She comes across as a strong and active, but decidedly mature character - as befits a woman whose age startled me when I looked it up on IMDB. Two other I-know-that-face actresses form a trio with her, and come from the same age group. I found it absolutely delightful to see these ladies being honest about their ages in these roles, but still as playful as schoolgirls, even to bouncing on the bed and to resurrecting their years-ago girl band to entertain Sophie's wedding eve. Maybe you have to be of the graying age to appreciate it properly, but it was great to see women of my age (and up) with exciting histories and plenty of goofy excitement in their present days, too.<br /><br />But, amid all these enjoyable parts, a few stand out. One was that massive dance routine to "Dancing Queen" - I laughed so hard that my eyes watered continuously the whole length of it. If you thought that the day of the musical comedy movie ended with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BKHU5G">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</a>, well, you had good reason to think that. New facts just came onto the scene, though, and the musical comedy is back again, at least this once. It's howling funny.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>ALL of this film is perhaps a tad "Bollywood", as my wife pointed out--but we both ADORED this film. If one is not an ABBA fan, then forget it. If one is a Colin Firth fan, it has only minutes of Colin at his funniest and most brilliant. ALL the actors sing well.<br /><br />If I may say so, the potshots taken at Pierce Brosnan for his singing are nasty and stupid. There is a very famous songwriter who insists on singing his own music, and his voice is far worse than Pierce's. And as I see in another review, Pierce STUDIED just to be able to sing. I do agree it was a bad decision to give him "SOS". He doesn't have the range for it.<br /><br />The cinematography is what one expects from a musical, come on! Did you expect Hitchcockian or Spielbergian work here? It's supposed to be fun. Perhaps the critics of this film are not old enough to know what's good and right. This film is definitely good and right. The storyline is NOT a pathetic contrivance-- SHAME ON YOU AMAZON-- because if one watches it, it touches, it works. That canned corn is from the old critiques of the Broadway version. No one could have staged this; as a film, it's magic. It was lovely purely to watch the actors clearly having the times of their lives!<br /><br />As a rule, I dislike musicals with all my might. I watched this film because of what it is, who's in it, and the music. I was never at any moment disappointed. Having just endured a death in the family, this movie was almost a salvation. I laughed, sang along, and rollicked until it was almost a desecration.<br /><br />It's been since 2000 since I saw a movie that made me act like that.<br /><br />And by the way, if you watch carefully, Sophie DOES learn who her actual father is--but don't expect the film itself to reveal it.<br /><br />One final thing about this plain DVD version: there are no extras to speak of; a deleted scene that is delightful but gives too much away, that's all. No documentary or interviews. With this kind of fun film, who needs it??</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Let's face it. If Meryl Streep was cast in a Fruit of the Loom commercial, she would still be the standout piece of produce, lending conviction to a one-dimensional part others would easily dismiss as too superficial. That's the way to view this ebullient, featherweight 2008 confection based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031WEN">long-running jukebox musical</a> from the prolific songbook of 1970's super-pop group ABBA, all of which were written by bandmates Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus. Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0784011710">Sophie Zawistowski</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783240171">Karen Blixen</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J103PC">Miranda Priestly</a>. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302641934">Buona Sera Mrs Campbell</a>, you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.<br /><br />This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark and is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.<br /><br />Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant filmmaking experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic "Dancing Queen" number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.<br /><br />In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and "Money, Money, Money", as well as the more emotive ballads like "Slipping Through My Fingers" and "The Winner Takes It All".  She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on "S.O.S." (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsg?rd as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry - are also likeable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, "I Have a Dream". The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of "Dancing Queen" complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of "Waterloo" (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook). Go at your own risk...you may love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep plays a single mom whose daughter Sophie is about to be married.  Sophie has never known who her father is and in an attempt to find out she does a bit of detective work via her mom's diary.  She discovers that there are three men who potentially could be her dad, and she invites them all to the wedding unbeknowst to her mother.<br /><br />Watching Meryl Streep and her two buddies recreate their old singing group or Meryl Streep singing to her daughter who is about to be wed will take you from cheers to tears.  Streep's acting abilities translate beautifully to her singing, whether it's a teary-eyed mother reminiscing about her daughter's childhood or a feisty middle-aged woman leading the other local women in a rousing Abba song.

The Musical Based on the Songs of ABBA,</a> has a lot going for it. The least of which is the immensely likable songs of ABBA, which anchor the movie with familiarity. The scenery is gorgeous and the cast is packed with exuberance and cheer. Then again, at 59, Meryll Streep steals the film with her presence as the former girl-group singer retired to an island resort. Packed with good cheer, great music and eye catching dance numbers, "Mamma Mia" is as frothy and glittery as the foam riding the tops of an island wave. But it's also just about as substantial.<br /><br />As Donna, Streep just shimmers. Her gal-pals Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Waters) each have scene stealing moments. When Tanya lets loose on a flirtatious younger man with "Does Your Mother Know," it's one of the funniest bits in the movie. As Sophie, Amanda Seyfried carries her songs probably better than anyone here. Even as she is the focal point of "Mamma Mia," the story is ultimately Streep's. It is Donna's crisis of parenthood (the flimsy set-up where Sophie invites her three probable fathers to her wedding) that forms the crux of the movie. The musical numbers spin off in all direction, not always conducive to the plot.<br /><br />Be that as it may, we watched the "sing-along" version of the film is great fun, and Streep's version of "The Winner Takes It All" is a show-stopper. I also defy you not to sing along to either "Dancing Queen" or "Waterloo" (done as a campy finale with the principals in ABBA period costumes). Also noted, none of the male leads can sing worth a lick, although the story that Brosnan didn't know he was being cast in a musical is pretty funny (he was approached with the offer to play a male lead in a movie with Meryll Streep, then was told what the movie was AFTER he accepted). But if you accept "Mamma Mia" for what it is, a big hunk of feel-good fun, you won't come away disappointed.<br /><br />Now where is that Movie adaptation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ILC4">We Will Rock You</a>?</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Sophie has been raised on a remote Greek island by her mother Donna (Meryl Streep).  Donna has never told Sophie who her father is, and that has left a hole in Sophie's heart.<br /><br />But as her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper) nears, Sophie finds a journal her mother kept 21 years ago.  In it, she finds three potential candidate for her father, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard).  Convinced that she will know her father on sight, she invites all three men without telling her mother.  But when all three men arrive, Sophie finds herself just as confused as she was before.  And their presence just complicates the wedding plans even further.  Will Donna recover from the surprise?  Will Sophie figure out who her father is?  Will the men discover why they are there?  And just how many great songs can be used to capture the feelings of the characters?<br /><br />I was not familiar with ABBA before I saw the movie, so pretty much had no clue what to expect.  And I loved these songs.  Honestly, if I didn't know where the music originated, I would have told you all the songs were written for the musical.  Not bad for a concept I dismissed as silly a few years back.  But these pop/rock sounds fit the story perfectly.<br /><br />And this cast can sing!  Meryl Streep is especially impressive as Donna, and gets the most songs.  The emotion she gets into so many of the songs is outstanding but hardly surprising considering how great an actress she is.  The only weak link in the singing department was Pierce Brosnan.  He is adequate while the others are outstanding.  But that's a minor point.<br /><br />With the number of songs in the movie, there is no way that they can develop all the characters well, especially since the film is under two hours.  Donna and her two friends are the best developed, followed by Sophie.  Honestly, I was disappointed with how little development Sky got.  I thought he'd play a bigger role.  And I had a hard time keeping the back story on the three potential dads straight.<br /><br />But I was certainly pulled into the story, wanting to know how things would end.  I felt the climax was rushed to make way for one more song, the only time I felt that way about the story.<br /><br />This movie will leave you humming a tune with a smile on your face.  That's all I ask from a musical.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The GOOD<br /><br />- Wow! The music is lovely. It also inspires me to dance. It sounds exactly like the original played by ABBA.<br /><br />- The scenes are beautiful with the sea, mountain, beach, sunshine and houses on the mountain.<br /><br />- There are many hilarious scenes too. For instance, Meryl Streep was carried away while singing Mama Mia and fell through a hole. Another is where an older lady flirted with a younger, brown guy. One more is where multiple guys dancing on the pier with their diving fins.<br /><br />- Out of 18 songs in this movie, I love 13 of them. They are: Honey Honey, Money, Mama Mia, Chiquitita, Dancing Queen, Lay All Your Love on Me, Super Trouper, Vouler Vous, SOS, The Winner Takes It All, When All Is Said and Done, Take a Chance on Me, I Have a Dream.<br /><br />The NOT SO GOOD<br /><br />- Some of the songs are incomplete or interrupted with dialogues. This is really annoying because I need to listen to the whole song to completely enjoy it. For example, in the scene of Chiquitita song, the last sentence was omitted. It's replaced with the dialogues between Meryl Streep and her two girlfriends. The director should have the song completely sung before continuing with the actors' conversation.<br />Another is in the scene of Gimme Gimme song. It is broken into 3 pieces by the actors' conversation. That makes it much less enjoyable.<br /><br />- It does not have Karaoke version. That means there's no scene with only instrumental music. So, you have to sing along. You can't sing  Karaoke.<br /><br />- Of course, it's a musical film, so, please don't expect any logic and character development.<br /><br />Well, nothing is perfect. In short, every Karaoke fan or person who loves singing should have one copy. I'm singing along and dancing with this DVD once a week now. It's an excellent showcase of  timeless songs.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>Sophie, a 20 year old girl whose getting married, invites 3 men to her wedding hoping one of them is her father that she never met.

Very nice and touching songs.<br /><br />However there were more songs than dialogue, which kind of made us bored after a little while. I also wished it didn't include these little inappropriate scenes because it could have been a great family movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was nice to watch. I rank it second after Moulin Rouge.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>For anyone who loves ABBA's timeless songs (including myself), it is hard to dislike "Mamma Mia!" In addition to those irresistible ABBA numbers, you've got nice locations (of the beautiful coast in Greece), plus the talented cast, veterans and newcomers. Sadly there are two things that "Mamma Mia!" doesn't have: story and direction.<br /><br />Well, there is a story, but a very thin one. Three former boyfriends of Donna (Meryl Streep) travel to an old hotel Donna runs on a small island in Greece after so many years' absence. The three men (played by Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsg?rd and Pierce Brosnan) are in fact secretly invited by Donna's only daughter, 20-year-old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), who is going to be married.<br /><br />You will be told that far in the first ten minutes and ... that's all. The entire cast did well (OK, Pierce Brosnan needs singling lessen, I admit). Obviously they had a good time making this film and you can feel that in the end credits, but "Mamma Mia!" stops there. The characters sing and dance and it is fun to see them doing it, but their dancing and songs, or the lyrics, need to be incorporated into the story. First-time director Phyllida Lloyd (who also did the stage version) just doesn't know the rhythm of filmed musical, missing the timing of music--how to build up the emotion and when to start and stop the tunes. The songs, great as they are, begin and end rather randomly.<br /><br />Great musicals like "Singin' in the Rain" have a good story to tell. You've got great songs and actors in "Mamma Mia!" but you need something more to draw the audience into the film's world. To do so "Mamma Mia!" depends upon the enthusiastic acting of the cast. You got Meryl Streep and she will not disappoint. Those who have seen such films as "Postcards from the Edge" and "Ironweed" know Meryl Streep can really sing. And she does not just sing, but bring energy to her performance and she does it again in "Mamma Mia!" Maybe too much of energy, but it is fun. With more subtlety, however, the film could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Who'd of thought that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001DZO">ABBA</a> songs could be so operatic? Certainly not me! The fact that I hadn't seen the stage-play (by the same name) probably added to my surprise.<br /><br />Being no fan of that Swedish rock group of the 70s and 80s, I was doubly surprised to find myself enjoying this film so much. In no small measure was my enjoyment thanks to the all-star cast, no doubt, but also how well incorporated the songs were within the story.<br /><br />The story is worthy of a Shakespearean comedy with high confusion, paternal bonds in question, and lady-love finding its way into the audiences heart in unusual ways. The story, this time, revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X4O42I">House, M.D.</a>) and her desire to find her true father before her wedding. Stumbling upon her mother's diary, Sophie finds three candidates that might be her dad. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSI7BM">The Devil Wears Prada</a>) has no idea that her daughter has invited three of her former loves to the wedding. And when they arrive, paternal sparks go a-flying, as do the flickers of old romances. Harry (Colin Firth) comes to the wedding out of fear that he'd done something and then left it undone (i.e., not properly fathering his daughter). Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U7WV1Y">Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End</a>) comes simply because he's curious. But Sam (Pierce Brosnan, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J10KVE">The Matador</a>) arrives with a burning love-gone-by for Donna. And when Donna finds out all three of these old flames have arrived for the wedding, chaos ensues ...mixed with some toe-tapping music (Gah! Toe-tapping to ABBA!).<br /><br />The other element to the story are two old work friends of Donna's (they were a trio of singers at one time) who arrive for the wedding and find Donna in a frazzled state. Rosie (Julie Walters, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZIZ0RU">Becoming Jane</a>) is the active and playful one with plenty of spunk, while Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the sexual over-achiever who has to fight off the advances of a few young island boys.<br /><br />Surprises abound as the movie winds down. One person comes out of the closet, while two others find love (even though one is running away from any possible commitment). Donna herself might find love in the arms of one of those old flames. And Sophie's wedding gets a change of venue.<br /><br />One of the final songs on the track ("Take a Chance on Me") is extremely funny and well thought-out. And as the credits roll, there's some laugh-out-loud moments as we get to watch Colin Firth try to dance in a skin-tight, sequined outfit (along with the other main players in the film).<br /><br />The final positive note for this movie has to be that the director Phyllida Lloyd was also responsible for MAMMA MIA's huge stage production success, and her translation of it from stage to silver screen was exceptionally well-rendered. This one's a surprisingly good film, even for those folks who aren't into ABBA.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>This was a great fun inspirational film.  Innocent and charming (well, with some small sexual innuendos).  But, here's how I see that some people will be divided on its overall appeal:<br /><br />For people who've heard of ABBA and may know a couple of their songs, this film will definitely make you wanna run out and buy some ABBA CD's.  For those of us (like me) who already have all of ABBA's CD's and have cherished ABBA all their life, these actors singing ABBA songs is rather dull and much less energetically expressive than the ever-vivacious vocal outbursts of Annafrid and Agnetha (the original girls of ABBA).<br /><br />The original songs from ABBA have incredibly talented harmonizing and enthusiasm.  None of these actors can hit the notes like Agnetha and Annafrid (also known as Frida) did in their day.  And especially Pierce Brosnan. This was an embarrassing transition from being a former James Bond.<br /><br />However, I'm glad to see a movie made as a musical to many of ABBA's fabulous songs.  Pick up ABBA's greatest hits on CD, or just go ahead and get all eight of their original albums.  You will be in for a treat!<br /><br />Let me give you one good example of the girls of ABBA belting their voices out so strong.  Go to YouTube and listen to ABBA's version of "Chiquitita", and concentrate of the voices and the fabulous background orchestration.  It is one of the greatest songs they've done which is a great example of their enormous talent.  ABBA will never be topped.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>This poorly made, highly obnoxious and often annoying musical is so over-the-top with deliciously tacky charm that it almost demands you enjoy it.  The scary thing is that, for the most part, I did.  I remember turning to my wife after the film had ended and muttering the words "that was awkward" and maybe that is part of the charm.  No one seems entirely comfortable with their role in this film, and that layer of discomfort kind of adds a tinge of adorableness to the film and its vast array of characters.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that this is a good movie, just a fun one.<br /><br />The story is of young Sophie who lives on this crazy island with her single mother who runs a hotel on the verge of a breakdown.  When Sophie decides to get married she wants to have her father walk her down the isle (what young girl doesn't).  There is just one problem; she doesn't know who he is.  After reading her mother's diary she discovers that there are three possibilities; Sam, Bill or Harry.  She decides to invite all of them to her wedding in order to discover who her father really is, but when they arrive she realizes that finding him is going to be harder than she thought.<br /><br />The film is ridiculous and just a hodgepodge of overzealous musical numbers that are so focused on zany choreography that they forget the most important aspect of a musical number is the singing.<br /><br />Despite this, I cannot say I was not entertained.<br /><br />The best acting award goes to Streep (is that really a surprise).  She is so over-the-top yet thoroughly committed so that even when she's all over the place it is in a good way.  She is clearly having a blast filming this and it shows all over her face.  Surprisingly, young Amanda Seyfried actually holds her own and delivers a nicely tuned performance.  It doesn't hurt that out of the entire cast they are the only two who can sing (Streep has a few pitch problems but she actually soars on her final number).  Christine Baranski is funny, as is Walters.  Colin Firth is, well, Colin Firth (you gotta love this guy) and Stellan Skarsgard (who I've been a fan of for some time) delivers one of the more sympathetic `fatherly' performances.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan is a revelation here, and not in a good way.  His voice is GOD-AWFUL (he sounds like a dying walrus, or a drowning man with Down syndrome; take your pick).  I'm really surprised they allowed him to sing his own songs (I'm really surprised they didn't recast the whole film to be honest beings that the two female leads are the only ones who somewhat make it through this film with dignity).<br /><br />His Razzie was certainly owed him.<br /><br />Don't expect a good film (I hope you aren't), but do expect to have a good time.  I can see why this is so loved, for it is lovable.  It is very poorly made (even the dancing numbers seem choppy and sloppy), but Streep does wonders for the film to be honest.  Her ability to just throw caution to the wind and embrace the campy mess that she has been dealt simply draws in the audience and lets them know that it's okay to turn off your brain and have a good time.<br /><br />Even Meryl Streep knows that this movie is horrible.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>It does not matter what this story is of-ABBA music says it all.<br /><br />And nice semi-naked bodies of any gender performers either add to a visual pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Agnetha F&auml;ltskog, Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad are the  "A's" and "B's" that comprise Abba. Though it was also the name of a canned fish company, Abba made it their own, and became an international sensation with a catalogue of hits built on catchy hooks and a wall-of-sound made of up of multi-tracked harmonies from Agnetha and Anni-Frid.<br /><br />Two fans wanted to base a musical on Abba songs--stringing the tunes together with a little plot to give it a very slight pretext. The band was at first cold to the idea, but the fan/musical producers prevailed, and after many, many performances, and now a movie, Abba has come around.<br /><br />------------------<br />Sophie: [reading Donna's diary] We danced on the beach, kissed on the beach and dot, dot, dot.<br />=================================<br /><br />Mamma Mia! was wildly successful, but lots of critics took aim, some calling it the worst movie of the year. I think that Mamma Mia! appealed to an untapped older audience nostalgic for the days when Dancing Queen ruled the airwaves and the dance hall. I think it was more like a Fantasy Camp for actors who always secretly wanted to be rock stars, and also wanted a chance to get away to a luscious Greek Island. It is like singing Abba at a Karaoke bar--and what is the point of judging it on the basis of the singing? It is the fun factor that is paramount. The people were having so much fun making the movie that you can't help but be caught up in the festive mood. What does Meryl Streep have to prove as an actress? Did you want to see if she could master yet another accent, and emote flawlessly, as if it were her native tongue? Don't you think she could do that blindfolded in her sleep with one hand tied behind her back?<br /><br />----------------<br />Donna: And welcome to- to Sophie's dad. I have to tell you, he is here.<br />Sophie: I know, I invited him.<br />Donna: You couldn't have, I don't even know which one it is.<br />=====================================<br /><br />Meryl Streep's acting was bad, but it was fun to watch her let her hair down and just have fun. How often do you get to see Streep, master thespian that she is, act badly? Pierce Brosnan signed up on the strength of her name alone, without even reading the script. Was he disappointed that she didn't bring her "A" Game? No, he was relieved that his acting wouldn't have to be judged in comparison. It was bad enough that of the whole cast, he was judged the weakest singer.<br /><br />Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsg?rd were the three men from Donna Sheridan's past who might be Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried's) dad. Skarsg?rd was the token Swede, and I am only mentioning him at all since I wanted to make use of my Umlaut font set, but I was glad to have him there, as after all, Abba was a Swedish group. The three possible fathers were more than adequate to their roles.<br /><br />----------------<br />Donna: Wh-wh what are you all doing here?<br />Bill: I'm writing a travel piece.<br />Harry Bright: I- I'm on a spontaneous holiday.<br />Sam Carmichael: I-I-I I just dropped in to say... hi.<br />===============================<br /><br />The three woman, led by Streep, were really great. Here is some interesting background trivia. The women who wrote Mamma Mia based the character of Tanya on Mary Ann, a character played by Christine Baranski on Cybill Shepherd's eponymously titled sit com. No wonder Christine Baranski was perfectly cast as Tanya, and the catharsis is complete.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Tanya: [talking about Donna's money troubles and her life in general] Yeah, but are you being taken care of?<br />Donna: What do you mean?<br />Tanya: Are you getting any?<br />Donna: Oh, you mean...<br />[turns on the screw driver, making loud noises, then says to the screw driver:]<br />Donna: Down, boy.<br />===================================<br /><br />Julie Walters as Rosie was also a little show stealer.<br /><br />------------------------<br />Rosie: [to Tanya] Typical isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad and then three come along at once.<br />============================================<br /><br />So, if you want to pass judgment on a movie and fault it for bad singing, bad acting, and over or under exposed film, then by all means throw those rotten tomatoes. But if you want to have fun, fun, fun 'til your daddy takes your T-Bird away, then what are you waiting for?

"Mamma Mia" is a fine movie, but do me a favor, please find/buy/rent a copy of "Muriel's Wedding" wedding (heck, even look at the cover of the DVD first and you'll see what I mean).<br /><br />The common theme here seems to be (some of) the music of Abba.<br /><br />4 stars for Mamma Mia<br />4 stars for Muriel's Wedding<br /><br />Be warned, Muriel's Wedding is 'different' as Australian comedies go...</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>ABBA's music is wonderful, no doubt about it but there is still something so annoying about old people shaking it. Isn't it sad enough that we are aging? Did we have to go through the pain of watching old people acting stupidly? It was excruciatingly painful to watch it.<br />Yes, the movie became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom of all time, but that's how ironic life is. I wouldn't watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Mamma Mia!" brings the wildly successful ABBA-inspired stage musical to the screen with a cast of actors who don't usually sing or dance. The film retains the behind-the-scenes talent from the stage show: director Phydilla Lloyd, producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and score by former ABBA member Benny Andersson. It adds one song and leaves a few others out, but this is very much a transfer of the stage musical to the screen. A young woman named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) plans to marry her beau Sky (Dominic Cooper) and dreams that her father will be at her wedding to give her away. But Sophie doesn't know who her father is. Twenty years ago, her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had summer flings with three men. Sophie invites all three to her wedding in Greece in hopes that she will recognize her father. But when Donna sees the men from her past, she's sure that they will ruin the wedding.<br /><br />There's hardly any point in mentioning that the set-up for this musical romp in the Greek Isles is silly beyond words. But the three candidates for Sophie's paternity are appealing guys, and the actors are game: American architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth), and Swedish adventurer and travel writer Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard). The men are counterbalanced by a trio of sprightly middle-aged ladies: Donna and her friends Rosie the author (Julie Walters) and Tanya the serial divorcee (Christine Barnasky). These are fun characters, and I enjoyed them. I wish I could say the same for the younger set. Amanda Seyfried has a nice enough voice, but Sophie is annoying and seems more like a 13-year-old than a woman of 20.<br /><br />The musical numbers are dull. I partly blame the lack of vigor on the locations. This is a jukebox musical, so the songs are not integrated into the plot as seamlessly as they would be if the music had been written for the stage. And since this is a movie, filmed on location in Greece, they don't have the benefit of an intimate venue. On stage in a small venue, energy would be flying off the stage. In these wide open locations, further muted by transfer to the screen, the musical numbers fall flat. I kept hoping that the next scene would not be musical, because the stuff in between was reasonably charming. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that most of the principle cast is over 50. Generally an appealing cast, even if they are not the best-suited talent for a musical, but unfortunately, the music that's supposed to be the selling point is the film's weakness.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition has the option of viewing a Sing-a-Long version in which the lyrics to the songs are displayed across the screen during musical numbers. There is one deleted musical number called "The Name of the Game" (3 min). And there is a feature commentary by director Phyllida Lloyd. She talks about locations, some photographic techniques, characters, cast, filming, her approach to the musical numbers, and various technical details. Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep is pretty good.  Pierce Brosnan is awful - he can't sing and shouldn't try.  There is a kind of peculiar slant to this movie - all the strong roles go to women - the men are weak and have marginal roles.  Most of the emotional and physical intimacy is between women with men shut out.  If this is your cup of tea, you might like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>The touring musical, MAMMA MIA! now becomes a musical movie.

The singing in this musical is mediocre, but you might enjoy the songs which came from the Swedish pop-rock group, ABBA (1972-83).<br /><br />ABBA was Benny Andersson, Anna-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog, Bjorn Ulvaeus. Their songs were so popular, they were used in 1999 in the touring musical, MAMMA MIA!.<br /><br /> I did not like this movie too well, but I thought Amanda Seyfried was perfect for her role.

One thing is for sure, Meryl Steep can do anything, I mean, could this role have been any different than her recent turn as Miranda Priestly?  As for Brosnan, I liked him in this, he gave his all, and get real we all figured he could not hold a tune, I mean, everybody should have one flaw, I mean, right?  Really, you cant beat the ABBA tunes in this, they are so gloriously Disco and the Greek Island local is breathtakingly beautiful.  One thing is for sure, everybody in this seemed to be having the time of their lives and that sort of thing is contagious, whether the film is Citizen Cane or not.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This is a musical first and foremost, make no mistake; it has beautiful scenery, an amusing story line, and lots of music and dancing.

Several younger members of our family recommended it to us and we watched it and found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of the songs. I'll admit they did enjoy it so you may well enjoy it too; just watch it first and get a feel for what you would be buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>I only watched this film because the PPV selections were limited and thought....hmmmm,  Meryl Streep how can I go wrong even tho I have a great disdain for musicals and never really understood the appeal of ABBA...wow, was I wrong....the movie despite all the surprising perfomances is carried via the most delicate, insightful and endearing lyrics of ABBA songs which I never really paid much attention to....they I believe are the star performance of the film...the location was unnatural and prolly forced to get one's attention for it's superb beauty and Meryl looks just incredible dressed in that deep blue hue....how fun it was to see her sing and dance like a Ziegfield girl!!!

Five hours until warm-up time in the orchestra pit. Take a walk? &iexcl;Ni modo, Quasimodo! Rent a flick? Why not!<br /><br />You'll have to believe me that I have no prior ABBA consciousness, despite the fact that I spent half my childhood in Sweden. I was in Mediterranean and Caribbean lands when they 'conquered' the Anglophone pop music world. I heard or read the name. Honestly, I thought they were another 'heavy metal' or Swedish vampyr band. I had no idea what they looked or sounded like. My wife tells me now that we danced to ABBA covers at innumerable family weddings over the past 25 years, but I never pay much attention when I'm trying to shake my booty without looking as dorky as I feel. Okay, do I suddenly love their music now, after seeing/hearing "Mamma Mia!"? Well... it's bouncy and sweet, but no way will it displace Dufay or Scarlatti on my iPod. ABBA is musically as corny as their costumes -- a 1970s period piece. Apologies to their fans, and to all Swedes everywhere. Hurray for IKEA! Hurray for ABBA! Sweden needs all the export credits it can get.<br /><br />And now the movie review! The most artful thing about Mamma Mia is the integration of the songs and chorus-line numbers into the melodrama. Reviewer JP, whose recommendation of this film was responsible for me picking it up, commented on the "Greek Chorus" of Greeks serving as a human and musical backdrop for the jet set cast of English speakers. She's right, and it was effective. I'm so far out of touch with Broadway that I thought JP's praise of the music/drama blend sounded just like Bollywood. I've seen a lot of Bollywood films. I urged JP to have a look at Lagaan, one of my favs. Bottom line? Mamma Mia is almost... almost... as artful at squeezing into and out of musical extravaganzas as Bollywood, though the ABBA songs are less appealing. Keep practicing, USA! You'll catch up with India some day.<br /><br />The story? Mildly amusing, absolutely predictable, jolly enough to keep me watching. Merle Streep looks remarkably like my sister, or vice versa. I get a kick out of the resemblance, and I was delighted to see my 'sister' having so much fun in a role. Streep's enjoyment of her own feeble singing was infectious. I was tickled to watch my usually dour countryman, Stellan Skarsg?rd, try to act zany. Zaniness is not intuitive for Swedes. Stellan and I look a lot alike, also, though I'm in better shape. I took a sardonic pleasure in watching him look hopelessly dorky when he danced. At the other extreme, the spark-plug friend of Mamma - I didn't catch her name, the tall one who can really sing and dance - is obviously a real Broadway-ite, and carried the film at times when others were looking vague about their blocking. The young'uns were cast for their looks, and look they did. Some credit has to go to the Greek Islands for the exuberance of the film also; I've spent time on Mykonos, Skiathos, Santorini, etc., and my own nostalgia for those times mixed into the characters of the three middle-aged guys who 'came back wishing they'd never left.' Too bad, now that I think of it, that there wasn't any Greek music at this Greek wedding!<br /><br />Five stars? Hey, just like it says on the box: "a hilarious, rousing & joyous celebration!"</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I am a complete ABBA fan, so the thought of watching the movie "Mamma Mia!" sounded right up my alley!! Plus the idea of a story revolving around Abba's songs was a novel idea too, which was another reason I was game for watching this movie.<br /><br />Okay, let's just say the story line is cheesy! The singing was horrible and the acting was bad on all counts.... I would have thought with the all star cast of Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Barabski, Julie Walters, and so on that this movie would have been great... at the very least acting wise!!<br /><br />I say skip the movie and listen to Abba's Greatest Hits!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>Oh.

Outside of the wonderfully talented young voice of Amanda Seyfried, I haven't heard singing this bad on film since Jack Nicholson in Tommy or George Burns in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Even though Meryl Streep should be given the "Best Try" award for looking like she was having a good time while not showing embarrassment, "singers" like Pierce Brosnan sound like they were soulless barking dogs and needed to be put out of their misery. Sure, visually the movie is a fun romp, but if I hear Meryl either sigh, cry, or moan during each song again, I swear I'm gonna buy me a chalkboard and scratch away. I find it hard to believe the Broadway play it's based on is so huge, but then again it's based on music that helped define a generation...just not mine. Heed this warning: unless you are a bonafide ABBA fanatic or simply "ghey" for musicals, do yourself a favor and rent Across The Universe again than to put yourself through this.

While I appreciate Streep's charisma in a part which really doesn't play to her incredible dramatic skills, everybody else in the cast gave me the feeling I was watching an improvised high school play done by people with very little talent. I was always a fan of Brosnan's James Bond but his musical talents are no more than mediocre, specially while singing (that may be too strong a word) SOS and just standing there with not much to do but stare at Meryl, during her interpretation of THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL. I also found odd they would choose such an weird looking girl in the lead (with eyes just like a frog). I guess it didn't feel to surprising that with so many people dancing near the water, a bunch of them would "accidentaly" fall in it and it's not like I was expecting CASABLANCA but the only fun I had in watching MAMMA MIA was laughing at its awfulness.<br />Strictly for people who love to make hores-cabooses of themeselves on dance floors.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>After being unceremoniously passed over for the film version of "Evita," the incomparable Meryl Streep finally showcases her singing and dancing talents in "Mamma Mia!"

Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan?  A movie from a musical?  It actually works!  The story is simple.  Donna (mother Meryl Streep) was once a wild child and now, twenty years later has a daughter, Sophie who is getting married.  They run a rustic hotel on a tiny Greek island.  The trouble is, Sophie never knew who her father was and neither did Donna.  Sophie figures out it has to be one of three men, so she seceretly invites them while mother Donna invite her two best friends making a perfect excuse to team up three couples during a wedding.  That's it.  Really.<br /><br />Even if you loathe ABBA, you'll find some good humor and songs here amidst the clever (if forced) storyline.  The songs and dancing action are non-stop, although some of the choreograophy could have been improved.  The visuals are stunning and Greece never looked so good.  Sure, some of the songs are goofball and corny, but they  carry the story and for the two male members of ABBA (Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus) to have created such a monster hit is remarkable.  Yes, Meryl Streep really CAN sing as good as the rest of the cast, but Pierce Brosnan is horridly, inexplicably painful to listen to.  No matter.  It's a simple, light-hearted film with lots of good music and good feelings.  The ending is hilarious.  Its just a good time for all.<br /><br />Dolby Surround makes a great mix for the view.</p></br></body></html>

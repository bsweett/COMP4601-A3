The assassination is a set-up, and Machete must find out who is behind it, while at the same time looking at self-preservation. Machete encounters two strong female characters. One is an ICE agent, the other has an operation assisting illegal immigrants, but she poses as a seller of burritos. These two women provide valuable assistance to Machete in his quest to keep himself alive while hunting down the bad guys. The film also contains caricatures of border hawk sheriffs and political figures. The graphic violence is lightened by dark humor that keeps the audience laughing, even while heads are chopped off.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>From the opening scene to the credits, "Machete" was violent, gritty and action packed. What I will say is that you will either love this movie, or hate it. I am one of those that LOVED it. Ok, you should also know that I appreciate Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Charlie Huston (Author of Hank Thompson series), Wayne Kramer (Running Scared) and Troy Duffy (Boondock Saints). I enjoy the crime noir or pulp noir genre of crime dramas because they tend to generate heated debates and discussions. No matter how you classify them, or what side you fall on (the love or the hate side), these sort of movies produce strong feelings...either negative or positive, and I think that is what most writers and producers hope for. There were some pretty controversial issues woven throughout the story.....vigilantism, immigration, drug abuse, sex, and violence....all of which set the stage for some pretty extraordinary events.  Although the subject matter and the dialog may seem on the surface to be in poor taste and offensive, I viewed it as a vehicle to tell the story, and a very entertaining story at that.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />Day laborer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) has been approached and hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to shoot Senator McLaughlin (Robert Deniro). This assassination attempt was meant to endear voters to the Senator who is running on a "strict regulations against illegal immigrants" platform. What's better than a fallen hero?  Anyway, what Booth does not realize is that Machete's past is a little more complicated than he initially realized. Machete is an ex-Federale (Special Agent) who was presumed dead after being shot in the head following a case that went terribly wrong, and even resulted in his wife being beheaded. Now living the simple life as a day laborer, Machete is associated with some very unique characters, among them Luz, a vigilante/activist whose main goal is to help those who truly need rescuing while running a taco truck. Unbeknownst to them both, they are being watched by the very tenacious, ICE Agent Santana Rivera (played by Jessica Alba) who wants to prove herself and bring in the bad guy(s). Meanwhile, Booth is restless and has his own agenda, not to mention a very unstable drug dependant daughter, April (played by Lindsay Lohan) who he has some very impure thoughts about. To complicate matters, Booth also has a relationship with Von Jackson (Don Johnson) an eager border enforcer; and Drug Lord Torrez (played by Steve Seagal), none of which will result in anything positive. Even Machete's brother, Padre Cortez (Cheech Marin) isn't immune to what is going on and finds himself in a precarious position. As the violence escalates and the story unfolds, you see an underworld that contains gun totting nurses, a patch wearing Rodriquez, hired assassins, and dirty politicians, not to mention seeing the knife wielding Machete kill several dozen people who stand in the way of vengeance or justice.<br /><br />So before passing judgment on the movie, I suggest you just give it a chance. Challenge yourself to look beyond the stereotypes, violence and other things that on the surface are disturbing, and take it for what it is....a story about wrongs being made right, and good overcoming evil. I highly recommend this movie, and think most will enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Based on the 70s exploitation flicks that had a stupid plot and enough sex and violence if you weren't laughing at the stupid plot.<br />There's a lot of known actors and actresses in this picture so they're all in on the joke.

I will admit going in the only reason I wanted to watch this was because De Niro was in it and it seemed like a strange choice for him.  After sitting through this I decided to send him 5 bucks...he obviously needs the money if this is the kind of work he is taking.  At the risk of losing money and comments I may receive, this movie was lame.  The best explanation I can give is that it's 1 hour and 45 minutes of blood splatters mixed with some nudity.  I like a good mindless flic now and then but this was just bad.  It's hard to comment on the acting, it has an all-star cast including Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Don Johnson, Steven Seagal, Cheech and Lindsay Lohan, but the writing was so bad even De Niro seemed like a B rate actor.  I am sure many of you will absolutely love this movie, but for me it was very lame and the worst movie I've seen since Macgruber.  I give it a D-.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>It took some time, but Robert Rodriguez finally got around to making his fake Grindhouse trailer Machete into a full feature film, and boy oh boy, it was mostly worth the wait.  Danny Trejo stars as our title hero: an ex-Federale on a vengeful mission who finds himself betrayed and left for dead when an assassination plot on a bigoted Senator (Robert De Niro) goes awry.  There's more to the story than that, but what there is in terms of story doesn't matter a whole lot as Rodriguez and his co-director Ethan Maniquis manage to craft and weave so much outrageous, bloody mayhem that you can't help but admire it.  Still though, Machete doesn't conjure up the same kind of B-movie greatness that Grindhouse managed to do, but it does a great job on its own merits regardless.  That, and a surprising cast featuring hotties Michelle Rogriguez and Jessica Alba, along with Steven Seagal (!), Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin, and Lindsay Lohan (yes Lindsay Lohan); all of which help make Machete such a blast to watch.  All in all, Machete doesn't mine the same kind of B-movie gold that Grindhouse managed to, but it's a blast all in itself, and wholeheartedly worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Machete is so off the wall violent that it makes the Expendables look like Mary Poppins. But unlike the Expendables, the movie doesn't take itself too serious. Machete is a retarded and cheesy flick that's trying to be a retarded and cheesy flick.<br />Lindsay Lohan even has fun poking fun at herself as a rich sleazy girl that constantly needs her father to bail her out of bad situations. Except, maybe she's so high these days that she doesn't realize she's poking fun at herself.<br />While you have Don Johnson (Miami Vice) as a boarder controller. Robert De Niro as an evil Senator that wants illegal aliens out of the U.S and Steven Seagal as the bad guy that just wants....Machete DEAD!!!!! There's just too much fun casting to mention. I can't wait for Robert Rodriguez to cast Paulie Shore as a bad guy in Machete 2 lol. Well I'm hoping he will anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is the movie my friends and I have waited three long years to see. It's very bloody, gory, sexy, kinky and funny and that's what makes it a good movie to see with your buds. I noticed there were a few scenes from the faux trailer that weren't used in the movie, but it won't ruin the fun. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a former Mexican Federale turned renegade. Three years after a druglord named Torrez killed his family, Machete is in Texas trying to find work. Machete is soon hired by a businessman named Booth to kill the corrupt Senator McLaughlin. After Machete is set-up, double crossed, and left for dead, he puts together a team of illegal immigrants to kill the bad guys. If you wanna eff with the wrong Mexican, I highly recommend MACHETE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>For those of you who enjoy Grindhouse films, there is no real need to read much further than this first sentence.  Just drop me a helpful on your way out the door, because you need to watch Machete NOW.  For those who need convincing...<br /><br />Machete is a brilliant display of exploitation, actually a subgenre of grindhouse films called Mexploitation that celebrates Mexican life while dealing with drugs, crime, sex, and money.  Initially just a humorous teaser between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0TM5S">Planet Terror</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0TM5I">Death Proof</a>, a combo from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, the story of an ex-Federale nicknamed "Machete" seeking revenge just had to be made as an homage film.  The result is undeniably entertaining.  The combination of incredible action without the dreaded shaky-cam, off the charts sexploitation, several humorous bits that heavy-handedly lampoon the incessant political hyperbole, ingenious use of everything within hand's reach for weapons, nudity or partial nudity from all just about all female cast-members (Rodriguez has never looked sexier and Alba is en fuego)...what's the point, this review could reach Moby Dick proportions if I listed everything I liked.  Needless to say, credits caused audible crowd celebration<br /><br />For gorehounds, this movie will definitely, unequivocally not disappoint.  Ignoring the obvious plethora of decapitations and double-taps that produce enough blood to fill Seaworld, let me just say there is one brilliant scene in which someone gets eviscerated and his intestines are used for urban repelling.<br /><br />The cast is unreal.  If someone had told me before this film that DeNiro, Seagal, Don Johnson, and Jeff Fahey were all bad guys, I would have been floored.  Believe it people, because Danny Trejo holds down the other side just fine with his low-rider Army headed by executive officers Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez (Alba is an ICE agent and Rodriguez is a resistance leader).  The cherry on top is the combo of shotgun wielding priest played by Cheech Marin and hitman for hire played by Tom Savini.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is responsible for just about everything awesome in this film, and it's pretty clear he enjoyed making it.  Several portions of the script are hilarious, and I'm still singing the chorus to the titular named song that accompanied Trejo through one of his carnage sprees.  The over-the-top nature of this film is pure gold that comes off as a cross between a Mexican version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790743752">Shaft</a>, a low-rider car show, a more violent version of Bronson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>, and Cinemax softcore fun (except the leading man is a 60+ year old ex-con covered in jailhouse tats and coarse, scarred skin).  The only flaw is the political discourse which, contrary to what some other reviewers have mentioned, is far from forgotten or dismissed.  Nonetheless, one speedbump can't stop an avalanche of awesome.<br /><br />I hope the fact that this started as a tongue-in-cheek teaser is inspiration enough to create at least one of the tongue-in-cheek sequels mentioned at the end of the movie.  We should all be so lucky.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>** Couple of SPOILERS (shouldn't matter, but I warned ya) ahead **<br /><br />The fake trailer to MACHETE was probably the highlight for me of GRINDHOUSE (2007) the intermittently entertaining Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino homage to 1970s exploitation cinema. Heck, all the trailers were cool and I'm glad to have HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN (best title of all time) to look forward to as well. Kind of weird though that anything more came out of that film, which received mixed critical response and generally poor box office. Well, I'm glad that Rodriguez said damn the critics and the public and went ahead with this, because MACHETE - though not exactly a masterpiece - easily beats out either of the two original GRINDHOUSE features, and helps to show, if there were any real doubt, that though QT may talk the exploitation talk (and talk, and talk...), it's his Texan buddy who walks the walk.<br /><br />The opening could not be any better: a splatter and nudity-filled prologue to the film proper, as federale Machete (Danny Trejo channelling DEATH WISH 3-era Charles Bronson with pretty near total success) wipes out a dozen henchmen of drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal), mostly with his weapon of choice but also with anything that comes in handy including an automatic with chopped-off hand still attached - but doesn't manage, at the end to save his wife from the same kind of fate that befalls most of his adversaries. Somehow he manages to escape a serious-looking cut to his groin area and the burning of the house; like a Bronson character, he doesn't need to vow revenge, we know he'll get it somehow.<br /><br />Cut to several years later, as ex-cop Machete is now earning a living as a day laborer in Texas. A far right-wing state Senator (Robert DeNiro) is in collusion with a group of Minutemen-type vigilantes led by Don Johnson, and greasy Jeff Fahey hires Machete to kill him for loads of cash, which the taciturn tough guy instead gives to Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), owner of a taco stand and....<br /><br />oh the heck with it. What's the point of going on about the plot?  A complex, involving story is not why you are watching this movie!  Suffice it to say that rough-looking, heavily tattooed and deep-voiced Machete spends most of the time cutting people up and blowing them away; we get to see him cut a guy open, pull out the intestine (a couple of minutes after a helpful lecture by a doctor) and then swing out a window with the unfortunate dude's organ as a rope; we get to see weedwhackers in action, a motorcycle-mounted gatling gun, a double-machete vs double-katana duel, a long soliloquy by a dying villain before he deliberately twists the blade imbedded in him all around his insides - you get the picture. And we get plenty of nudity and just-about, in the eye-candy form of Ms. Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and Lindsay Lohan - among others. And a plot with some pretense of seriousness (the corruption of immigration/border issues) that is essentially jettisoned for action 75% of the time - in the best exploitation style.<br /><br />MACHETE does run out of steam a bit, though it's mostly because Rodriguez and codirector Ethan Maniquis just want to pack too much in I think - a couple too many characters (we've also got Cheech Marin as Machete's shotgun-toting priest brother, Tom Savini as a hitman hired to stop Machete, lots of comic bits involving Fahey's henchmen and a few of Machete's allies, etc) and a last act that's just too drawn out and inevitable, even if we do get some excellent death scenes out of it. The acting isn't really "good", but should you expect it to be? No, not really. Fahey really seems to get his role and seems like he could fit right in as a slimeball in a 1973 blaxploitation film with Pam Grier or Jim Kelly; Cheech is good as well though he's not onscreen enough. And Seagal plays his villainous overlord exactly the same way he plays half the cop characters he's done - with arrogance and disdain - but it seems to work better in this kind of role I think. I wish more had been made of the 60something, not exactly handsome Machete getting to make it with every hot babe in the film - but maybe it's just as funny that it's not overdone; after all, we're used to stuff like this in every other action movie, Trejo happens to be just a bit more obviously outside of the male model category than Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />All in all, it's pretty damn fun. The tilt here is more towards action than satire, as opposed to last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BWP3W0">Black Dynamite</a> which is drawing some comparisons. That film was one of my favorites of 2009, and though this might not make my top 10 for 2010, I'm glad there are a few people around who still know how to do something like old-school action - even if they do have to resort to parody to get it done.  Now I just need to get ahold of some Mexploitation flicks.<br /><br />Long live Danny Trejo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>This is a nifty B movie with an amazing cast, but the shortage of extras on the DVD might merit waiting until a better edition is released at some point in the future.<br /><br />NO director's commentary... NO making of featurette.  Just an actual audience response soundtrack option and a few deleted scenes running less than ten minutes.<br /><br />Machete may not text, but he sure deserves better than this bargain-bin release.  Of course, the DVD is from Fox, so why would anyone expect anything better from a Rupert Murdoch company?<br /><br />I hope Robert Rodriguez of all people finds a better distributor for his films in the future...</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Having seen Grindhouse, I remember seeing a funny trailer for a movie called Machete.  I am not sure how the actual movie came about: whether this was an actual trailer or Rodriguez decided to make it due to positive comments on the trailer.  Anyway, I had been trying to find time to see this and I just saw it today in an empty theater.  I could not understand why since this film is one of the best action films I have seen in a long time!<br /><br />This movie has everything from a great cast, intriguing and very timely plot and many beautiful women.  I was drawn in from the first five minutes and never able to catch my breath again until the end of the film.  Machete is a Mexican police officer doing a raid on one of the Mexican Cartel heads who has kidnapped a girl.  He is told over his radio to wait for backup before going in.  He tells his partner that he is not waiting for anything but is going in.  His partner is immediately killed but Machete is a one man army (like Arnold in The Terminator) against the bad guys.  When he finally gets to the girl he finds out that it is all a setup by his own boss.  The Cartel Head (Steven Segal) then kills Machete's wife right before his eyes.<br /><br />Fast Forward three years and Machete is in Texas as an illegal alien looking to get by.  Don Johnson is the head of a border militia that guns downs aliens he captures and Robert DeNiro is a corrupt senator that goes on the hunt with Johnson.  Michelle Rodriguez is running a Taco stand while secretly involved in an underground network that gives passage to illegals to the United States and helps them find work.  Jessica Alba is an INS agent watching Rodriguez's stand while trying to catch her doing something that will lead to the head of the underground network.<br /><br />Machete is approached by the Senator's advisor to assisinate the Senator for money.  He reluctantly agrees but is then set up to take a fall.  I don't want to give anything more away about the movie but it is loaded with highly violent and bloody fights including a lot of bad guys getting sliced, diced and gored by Machete's favorite weapon, the machete of course!<br /><br />I loved this movie from start to finish and the ending announces two sequels (not sure if this was Rodriguez just making it up for this movie or if they were real).  If you love the old Charles Bronson Death Wish movies, you will definately love this film.  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>There's no question that Robert Rodriguez's MACHETE is a lot of "guilty pleasure" fun.  There's a visceral pleasure to be had from a guy as outstandingly scary looking as Danny Trejo wielding a machete and severing heads and limbs, disemboweling bad guys and general leaving a trail of carnage in his wake.<br /><br />All of these things were promised in the fake trailer for MACHETE which was presented prior to the start of GRINDHOUSE, the wonderfully crazy experience crafted by Rodriguez and his buddy, Quentin Tarantino.  Both men are drawn to the cheap thrill, to the idea of going just a little too far and over-the-top.  But Tarantino (PULP FICTION, KILL BILL, etc.) is extremely talented, a full tool box of skills at his disposal.  Rodriguez, on the other hand, mostly wields a hammer.  It's a stylish hammer, to be sure (see DESPERADO)...but his films don't feel like cheap and tawdry thrills delivered by a mad genius...they feel like exploitation flicks.  Often very fun...but also empty.<br /><br />Trejo plays the titular Machete (a Mexican federale in hiding in the US after his family is slaughtered by a horrible drug kingpin, played by Steven Seagal) with about two expressions.  He's a wonder to look at and has a crazy charisma.  He's not much of an actor, but he's riveting nonetheless.  His scarred and pock-marked face is real, and he carries himself like a guy who earned those scars.  Thank goodness he IS so much fun to watch, because if his role were a failure, there would be little else to enjoy.  Machete is drawn back into the spotlight when he's framed by Jeff Fahey in an assassination attempt upon Robert DeNiro, who plays a Texas state senator who campaigns purely on the idea of driving out illegal immigrants and then putting up an electrified fence.  You will not be surprised to know that Fahey, DeNiro and Don Johnson as a border vigilante, are all actually teaming up with Seagal to control the flow of illegals, and to profit from their misery.<br /><br />Machete is joined in his quest for vengeance by an immigration officer (Jessica Alba, once again proving unable to create a remotely believable portrayal of a human being), his brother who is also a priest (Cheech Marin, earning solid but obvious laughs) and a tough underground immigration supporter (Michele Rodriguez...looking mightily convincing wielding weapons).  Mayhem ensues, all of it bloody and noisy.  The film is gleefully violent, and usually only takes a break from the violence for some gratuitous nudity.  Lindsey Lohan shows up as Fahey's drugged-out daughter, and we get some body double nudity from her, in case you're interested.<br /><br />The movie is pretty much what you'd expect.  The audience of mostly younger men and their seemingly reluctant dates (those who had dates) whooped and hollered and had a great time.  For myself, I kept wishing for wit that was a bit funnier, for visual flair that was more dazzling.  Rodriguez stages plenty of violence, but much of it is surprisingly clumsy and unclever.  In one scene, he takes a long close-up of a corkscrew.  Why?  So that you remember it when two scenes later, it is plunging into the eye socket of a bad guy.  The foreshadowing of weapons of destruction is this obvious throughout.  And the best action sequences occur in the prologue and in a relatively early scene in a hospital, where Machete uses a truly unusual method of escape.  As the film wears on, the scenes get bigger but they become less satisfying.<br /><br />And imagine, if you will, 66 year old Trejo taking on a bloated and barely ambulatory Seagal in a climactic scene.  Yep, it was about as climactic as packing a lunch in the morning.  Tarantino is a master of finding great old stars and reinvigorating them in his masterpieces of mayhem (David Carradine in KILL BILL, Robert Forster in JACKIE BROWN).  Rodriguez seemingly wants to do the same with Seagal, but Steven Seagal was never a good actor even in his heyday.  DeNiro has minor amounts of fun in his role...but even the thrill of seeing him in such junk wears thin.  Fahey is generic.  Don Johnson has a bit of fun for awhile...but as with DeNiro, the fun wears off.  Only Michelle Rodriguez makes a real impression...she looks like a girl who would take no nonsense from anyone, and would handle herself well in a gunfight.  She is suitable support for the formidable Trejo.<br /><br />I enjoyed myself for most of the film, but by the end, I had stopped laughing and smiling.  In many ways, that fake trailer from GRINDHOUSE packed all the entertainment of MACHETE into a 3 minute package.  I remembered it so fondly, and that helped me enjoy this film...but in the end, MACHETE just couldn't cut it for a feature lengthy film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>*This does contain some minor spoilers*<br /><br />Machete has been a long anticipated film for anybody who was a fan of Grindhouse. All of the fake trailers seemed to add something special to the film and the combination of that intertwined between both Planet Terror and Death Proof made it a pretty incredible moviegoing experience. The experience just wasn't the same when the films were split up for home release. Now with the possibility of Thanksgiving also getting the full feature treatment, Machete is no longer just a fun idea for a two and a half minute trailer. Machete now clocks in at about an hour and forty five minutes, but could it spread that same sense of tongue in cheek ridiculousness throughout its entire duration? Yes, indeed it can.<br /><br />If you're a fan of any of Robert Rodriguez's R-rated films from the past, then you probably won't have any trouble enjoying Machete. The film's best attribute is that it never takes itself too seriously and it pays off in the best way. The dialogue in the film really stands out once you come to this realization. Between the gratuitous sex and nudity and completely outrageous violence are some pretty hilarious one-liners delivered from just about everyone in the cast. The film's low budget is pretty apparent at times and it's obviously deliciously corny at others, but it'd be a downright lie if I told you it wasn't incredibly enjoyable and highly entertaining.<br /><br />Machete is edited to look like it's from the 70's and it feels pretty authentic. Next to the delightfully absurd content contained in the film, the entire film has a gritty, grainy look that makes it feel older than it really is. That in addition to McLaughlin's ad campaigns, the voice over for "Machete Kills" and "Machete Kills Again," and the charmingly retro soundtrack just shows that Machete wore its 70's exploitation film influences on its sleeve.<br /><br />Some of the cast may leave you scratching your head, but put those doubts to rest. Danny Trejo is a better leading man than you may be expecting. What's sad is this might be the most satisfying role of Robert De Niro in years. Jessica Alba seemed a bit flat at times, but her shower scene will more than likely make you forget about that. Steven Seagal was surprisingly gratifying as the main villain, especially in the latter half of the film. Lindsay Lohan was the one I was most worried about, but she isn't given much screen time and pretty much plays herself in the film. I swear I spotted Quentin Tarantino as an extra towards the end of the film as well, but I'd have to see it again to make sure.<br /><br />Machete is the most ridiculous, over the top, and brutally awesome film of the summer season. Its tongue in cheek attitude and 70's exploitation atmosphere results in the film being way more amusing than it probably should be. Machete is everything The Expendables should have been and then some. Intestines are used in a pretty extraordinary way and storing your cell phone in a unique place just took on a whole new meaning. With statements like that, how can you not see this?</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>My friend said this movie was so so & hokey.<br /><br />I needed something to take the edge off Friday night after doing taxes.<br />Machete was it.<br /><br />From the opening stiffy to phones popping out of coochies, this movie was a hoot.<br />It says what we all think about politics & business.<br />The only difference is this movie acted it out.<br />What you said is what occurred to you.<br />Justice prevailed.<br /><br />Michelle Rodriguez is one hot mama.<br />You can fry my egg any day of the week!<br />;)</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS.<br /><br />Yes, that's right. Aside from Inception and/or The Wolfman, I literally can't remember the last time I gave a movie on here 5 stars. OK maybe with The Wolfman I was being a tad generous, but OK let's move on.<br /><br />I have a question for a lot of the positive reviewers on here: Did you REALLY like this movie, or are you just gushing out of respect for Rodriguez??? I'm a Rodriguez fan too, in case you didn't know. Tarantino and Rodriguez are the kings of b-movies. They know how to make a good b-movie and their extensive filmography has shown. With Tarantino you have Kill Bill, Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds, with Rodiriguez you have Planet Terror, From Dusk Till Dawn and the king of all things "Visually gorgeous", Sin City. What I love about both of them is that while their films are indeed exercises in Style Over Substance, they're aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously.<br /><br />I still stand by Grindhouse as the most fun I've had at the theatre. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. After "Hobo With A Shotgun", "Machete" showed. I laughed so hard! And then the news broke that Machete was going to be a full movie. I was excited.<br /><br />Turns out, some fake trailers should just stay fake trailers.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, Rodriguez's films are Style Over Substance. But they are aware of it, and don't take themselves too seriously, and for that, come off as awesome. Was this movie Style Over Substance? Yes. Did it follow its "Don't take yourself too seriously" rule? Well, it did... for the first 20 minutes.<br /><br />I was liking the first 20 minutes. Even as a gore hound, I was wondering if I should be eating during that scene! Then of course, we get the awesome betrayal scene and the hospital scene... I especially loved when Machete cut the man's abdomen open and used his intestine as a rope to escape through a window. I laughed!!! Then it went downhill from there.<br /><br />First off, Jessica Alba was annoying. Take her out of the movie and it wouldn't be different. All she does is just run around and scream the plot out loud. The most cringe worthy scene was near the end when she got up on the bonnet of the car and made that speech. That brought back memories of "Robin Hood" of earlier this year (you know what scene I'm talking about). Second, this film has too much plot in it, and too many characters. For a movie that's supposed to be a b-flick, this movie shouldn't be about political mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />The characters are a big letdown here. Or at least the representation of characters. Let's begin. "She" is a great character. About halfway through the film she is killed off... then near the end she survived!!! Or the Priest. He is a likable character too. Then he gets killed off 5 minutes after his first appearance. Or what about Daryl Sabara's character? He's a funny guy and he has (what feels like) 30 seconds of screen time... and yet he's one of the main actors in the opening credits!!! Bigger yet, what about the villain? WHO'S THE VILLAIN? Is it Segal, who has a total of 6 minutes of screen time, De Niro, or Fahey, who easily out of the three supposed villains gets the most screen time... except he dies 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLIMAX. Or Lindsay Lohan... why is she even in there, other than the fact that she's Fahey's character's daughter??? The climax is a total anticlimax. There's no excitement in the battle at all, it's incredibly dull and boring. Even the iconic bit shown in the trailer with the bike was underwhelming. And Segal's character's death even felt copped out and lazy.<br /><br />By the time the film was done, I was so glad I was out of the theatre. The film bored me enough with its slow pace. For a movie that claims to be an ultra gory action b-flick, there's about 10 minutes of action, 90 minutes of boring dialogue. This is supposed to be a b-movie, not some political crap. I like slow paced films, but not when they're supposed to be fun b-movies.<br /><br />Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, but I think your days are numbered!</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>The fake trailer comes to life thanks to Robert Rodriguez. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a bad ass who rarely speaks during the movie. The story is about him being set up to take the fall against a senator who is against illgeal immagrants. Why explain the story? The movie is full of non-stop action but does follow a story. Some people may hate it though but I really didnt care. The movie looks censored, so it could get an r-rating, but im sure this dvd will be released uncensored. A very good, action packed film with the usual laughs. A must for action lovers. I love how the 80's action films seem to be creeping back, although critics call them failures because they dont make money. Movies like Machete, Preadators, and The Expendables made a great summer. Go out of your way to see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Machete is one of the movies that remind me so much of the Indian movies that I grew up watching when I was a child. A lone crusader, who can destroy a small army of thugs, gets to romance all the ladies, ultimately prevails. Danny Trejo is Machete, whose family has been killed by Steven Seagal. He is such a natural fit for this role with his deadpan expression, rugged frame; he gets to deliver the funniest lines in the movie thanks to a wickedly written script. This movie is set against the backdrop of border politics and has a slew of characters with Robert De Niro playing his silliest role in years. If you want entertainment and hefty doses of action, nudity, violence and ridiculousness then this is the film to watch. Pretty enjoyable for what it is....Four stars. 2/20/11</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>This is an amazing movie. If you took parts of Itchy & Scratchy, GTA San Andreas, Blaxploitation movies of the 70s, and bad porn, and then had it stirred up, dipped in batter, and deep fried by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's unholy spawn, you get this stupidly perfect movie.<br /><br />Some of the scenes in this insane grindhouse fest will have you pause, rewind, re-watch, and repeat: they are that freaking over-the-top. There were at least a half dozen literal jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, WOW moments. I wish I could share some of the great moments but they have to be witnessed in stunned amazement as I did, without any preparation.<br /><br />Now let's get this straight; this movie has almost no genuine redeeming cinematic qualities. The plot is ridiculous, the script inane, there is no semblance of reality, and there is a moronically heavy handed pro-illegal immigrant message.  However, there is a reason this movie boasts big names and I'm pretty sure it wasn't for the paycheck or the chance to get an Oscar. It's because this is pure artery-clogging joy. If you feel the need to critique this movie you probably also look for the sanitary qualities of a truck taco. I don't know about you, but some of the best food I've ever eaten came from a truck. I can't sum it up any better than that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Not for kids but that aside it is action all the way.

Grindhouses usually showed 86 minute double features with names like PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE. They sustained themselves with showings of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and THE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE, ignoring the pungent smells of marijuana and "locker room" that permeated the seating area, along with cheap wine and beer and vomit---Yes, you can tell, I was there, I admit it. The films grindhouses showed had badly scratched blobby prints that hummed and jumped their sprockets. The third reel sometimes came in the middle, depending on the relative sobriety of the projectionist.<br /><br />Tarantino and Rodriguez's homage included a double feature, PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, and a number of Coming Attractions, among which was MACHETE, a movie simply rip-roaring with silly stereotypes, cartoonish violence, and an absurd plotline.<br /><br />MACHETE's star, Danny Trejo, is an American success story. After completing a now-long ago prison stint, Trejo began acting, at first staring in Andy Sidaris movies. His stone-cold scarred visage has graced many action films since.<br /><br />MACHETE is the story of a former Mexican Federale, nicknamed after his favorite weapon, whose family is killed by a drug kingpin, Mr. Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). Swearing eventual vengeance, Machete manages to escape by swimming the Rio Grande, taking up residence in Texas as an undocumented alien working as a gardener---What else???<br /><br />He is approached by a businessman, Booth (Jeff Fahey), who hires him to kill the ultra-conservative Texas Senator McLaughlin (played like a rabid LBJ by Robert DeNiro), who enjoys hunting down and shooting border crossers in company with Von (Don Johnson), the head of a self-appointed vigilante Border Guard unit (the bad guys in MACHETE are all played by Norteamericanos).<br /><br />Machete takes the upfront money he gets for shooting the Senator, and donates it to "The Network" a shadowy organization founded by the mysterious She, that aids undocumented aliens and others in need. "We help everybody" says Luz (the blazingly hot Michelle Rodriguez), who runs The Network from the back of a taco truck, providing money, health care, and lessons in self-defense to the disenfranchised people whom she protects. The idea of class warfare runs like a raging torrent through MACHETE.<br /><br />Although Machete never shoots the Senator, someone else does (in the leg), and Machete is blamed for the assassination attempt (in the wake of Tucson, the whole "shoot the Senator" subplot has become eerie). Now a hunted man, Machete vows to find out why and by whom he is being framed. He quicky allies himself with Luz, and with FBI Agent Rivera (Jessica Alba). He sleeps with both of them. He also sleeps with Booth's wife and drunken, drug-addled daughter (played by Lindsay Lohan, who was hardly acting) at the same time. Lohan ends the film wearing a nun's habit---talk about over the top!!!.<br /><br />Machete discovers that the whole shooting incident was carefully orchestrated by Booth, McLaughlin, Von and Torrez, who want to reduce the number of illegals in the U.S. in order to drive up drug demand, agricultural prices and service costs, and hence profits, in the companies they own. They can't find Machete, but they kill his brother, a Father played by Cheech Marin, by nastily crucifying him in his own church.<br /><br />Machete goes on a rampage, slashing and chopping his way through the rich mens' minions. The blood flies, often spattering the camera lenses. He escapes capture by cutting open a killer's belly, grabbing a handful of the guy's small intestines, and using it like an escape rope. In his gardener's role, he weed-whacks a few bad guys to death, impales a few more, and basically spreads gore like Christmas cheer.<br /><br />While doing so, he raises an army of Latino farm workers who attack the Booth-McLauglin-Von-Torrez forces in low-riders with blaring radios and bouncy suspensions, fruit trucks, and landscapers' pickups. In the end, the real supporters of American democracy win.<br /><br />It's simply hyperbolic, but, despite its clownishness, MACHETE does say something meaningful to the audience.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Machete sure delivered the throwback vibe to the exploitation flicks of the 1970's. They should have paired it up with Piranha 3-D and called it Grindhouse 2. Ever since the fake trailer in Grindhouse, fans have been calling for a feature length version, starring one of the toughest looking dudes to ever grace the screen.<br /><br />It's about time Danny Trejo, who I can't believe is 66 years old, finally gets the lead role. While he plays a great quiet menace (few faces can strike fear with just one look), he is supported with maybe the best cast ever to be assembled for a pure trash (in the best sense) film. Robert De Niro, Steven Segal and Don Johnson all play villain roles and they seem to having a blast. This is Steven Segal's best work (not saying much I know, but he fit's the part) and Robert De Niro, who seems to be channeling some of his Cape Fear accent, hasn't done anything this memorable in the last decade. Of the three main female roles, only Michelle Rodriguez leaves an impact. Jessica Alba is okay, but not all that believable, and Lindsay Lohan's character seemed like an afterthought. Cheech Marin provided a couple of good laughs, one having to do with...you guessed it, a certain green substance.<br /><br />I was worried the whole political message about illegal immigration would be too much, but it fit the mold of the story and didn't get too heavy. The script takes itself seriously for the most part, but there is a decent amount of humor. There was actually a bit more to the plot than I had expected going in, but don't worry, you'll still get plenty of lines made of only the sharpest cheese.<br /><br />The fight scenes and gore are fantastic. Machete likes to lop off heads and body parts using his namesake, but that doesn't stop him from trying out the occasional pistol, corkscrew, pimped out weed wacker with saws for blades, hospital knives turned into a swinging mace, a mini-gun strapped to the front of a motorcycle, and many, many more. Did I mention that he uses some poor guys' intestine, while he's still alive, in order to jump out a window and reach the floor below? So sick, yet so undeniably creative. The fights are edited in quick Robert Rodriguez fashion, but you never really lose sight of what's happening to who.<br /><br />On the downside, even though it didn't drag bad enough for me to check my watch, around 10-15 minutes could have been trimmed off to make it flow a little better. Oh, and what the heck happened to Tom Savini's character? He just vanished.<br /><br />The movie ends by claiming Machete will return in the sequel, Machete Kills, and the third entry in the trilogy, Machete Kills Again. I guess it's really more of a joke, unless it does well enough at the box office.<br /><br />This is the guy movie The Expendables wishes it was. I thought Stallone's effort was average, especially now, after seeing just one lone man with more raw toughness oozing out of his worn and scarred face than all those Expendable guys combined.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>Aside from the long and annoying scene of a man with severed aorta who kept standing and talking, which sounded very naive and irritating, the movie gathered every imaginable element for entertainment and enlightenment. The soothing and comforting persona of Michelle Rodriguez is twined and contrasted with the rugged and disfigured character of Danny Trejo. Rodriguez retained her consisted role of anti establishment and conscientious bend she performed in Avatar in saving the Pandora population. Trejo depicted the endless suffering of illegal aliens and fitted perfectly in the role of a fearless underdog who could transform society with his serious and deep wounds.<br /><br />Watching the two movies; Machete and The Lottery Ticket, in one week gave a sense of the disparities of the Black and Hispanic struggles for civil rights. The Lottery Ticket displayed the law abiding citizens of the black projects living under the poverty line and succumbing to the dominance of felons.  Machete played the harsh realities of a society of law that would only uphold its laws when the public remains vigilant. The Hispanics must climb the hills frequented by the Blacks in order to gain justice and ward off the foul play of crooks with official power. They did so with the modern access to high tech firearms.<br /><br />Machete kills and kills again and always comes back. But Machete's gathered hard evidence could easily be suppressed with the greater evil of corruption in a government that lacks conscience and motivated by greed and self enrichment. However, the network appeared a logical evolution of the suffering of the illegal aliens. Michelle Rodriguez was fortunate enough to find the Pandora clans on another planet, in parallel with her Hispanic Planet. Her people are described as cockroaches, illegal, and undocumented and marginalized from society, but she was blessed with gift of healthy soul and untainted conscience. From flying an exotic airship on Pandora, to running a taco truck in Machete, Rodriguez added a spine to a movie that already has many bright stars.<br /><br />The movie succeeded brilliantly in touching the hearts and souls of the underdogs and oppressed, when the mass media wages incessant onslaught on illegal aliens without the slightest chance to represent the other side of the story.  Machete did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Never mind the comically obvious fact that this movie is basically a kind of political propaganda flick. Nobody can deny that. It's transparency can make getting the message across more effective because it is letting you in on what its up to, sort of like in-your-face, wink-wink-nudge-nudge "we know You know" blatant product placement. I suppose. Anyway what I want to say is the movie is simply not that funny, period. No the politics are not what ruined "Machete", for me anyway, so much as the way the politics were delivered. My Mexican-American friends didn't like the movie. Because it isn't very funny. Are we learning how Mexicans are persecuted and about corrupt, opportunistic politicians and white racism, etc., or are we doing a comedy inspired by grindhouse and blaxploitation flicks (which means some socio-political commentary)?<br />You can serve-up the laughs along with some soical awareness. Just look at a recent homage to blaxploitation called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BWP3W0">Black Dynamite</a> to get the right idea. Dig it. And how about just more Machete killing and killing again and Desperado style fights. Brutal action, almost non-stop. But I loved "Once Upon A Time in Mexico" and "Planet Terror"... one BIG difference - these movies had more entertaining characters, no? Having Johnny Depp, Salma Hayek, Willem Dafoe, Enrique Iglesias, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes and Rub&eacute;n Blades in your picture helps a lot. Robert De Niro looks half asleep to me through many performances these days and he ain't funny. Lindsay Lohan...whatever. OK, Steven Seagal is funny and could have had a fatter role to play.<br /><br />Look, the Machete preview was *art* as far as I'm concerned and Danny Trejo is still the man.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>It's wildly exaggerated. It's supremely ridiculous. It spoofs its message. Huzzah! It's the action-packed motion picture, MACHETE, that you aren't supposed to take too seriously. It fulfills the promise raised in one of the faux trailers from the 2007 theater release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's double-billed GRINDHOUSE. A slew of big name actors graces this exercise in pseudo-exploitation cinema, but towering above them all is Danny Trejo as the brutish, laconic Machete Cortez, that vengeful ex-Federale. Trejo's face is so weathered it resembles a page out of a Thomas Guide. And yet he is somehow a chick magnet, if you buy into the film. No less than two hotties - Michelle Rodriguez and Jessica Alba - throw themselves at him.<br /><br />When one sets foot on the vengeance trail, it's best to have a huge friggin' machete to wave around menacingly. Machete Cortez is an old school sort of hombre stalking a modern world. His impractical tool of choice is the machete, even though he frequently has access to less primitive weaponry. But he's very good with his namesake blade. He cuts a friggin' swath.<br /><br />For shucks and giggles Robert Rodriguez, early on, inserts grainy footage to emulate those trashy old 1970s flicks. This alerts us that there'll be plenty of tongue-in-cheek shenanigans going down. The plot, such as it is, concerns the hot button topic of illegal immigration. Robert DeNiro, who's stooping to everyone's level now, plays conniving senator John McLaughlin, an aw-shucks, unctuous and drawly gent who is up for re-election. He's standing fast with his platform of proudly crapping on illegal immigrants. Scorning the even playing field, he hatches a fiendish scheme to garner him even more votes.<br /><br />Three years after the murders of his wife and daughter, Machete Cortez has snuck across the border, assisted by an underground network. Today, disenchanted and without purpose, the ex-Federale struggles as a day laborer. And then, because misfortune is a cruel b!tch, Machete gets framed for an assassination attempt on Senator McLaughlin. Now a man on the run, can Machete Cortez muster up his dusty skills as a buttkicking investigator? More importantly, can he score a machete somewhere?<br /><br />Let me reiterate, MACHETE is not meant to be taken seriously. Not when Lindsey Lohan's sporting a nun's habit and Michelle Rodriguez is running a taco truck and Jessica Alba is supposed to be a tough-as-nails immigration officer. And certainly not when Steven Seagal is playing a ruthless, sword-wielding Mexican drug lord. And when Machete gets on the loose, the coordinator of the frame job places a call to 1-800-HITMAN. I won't even mention those scantily clad nurses toting automatic weapons.<br /><br />Rodriquez cheerfully constructs a mythology around Machete. He's got him plonked in the center of a brewing revolution. His past exploits are already legendary. It doesn't hurt Machete's street creds any that, in one jaw-dropping sequence, he... let's just say he tests a goon's intestinal fortitude. To quote one villain, Machete "looks like CIA, FBI, DEA, all rolled into one mean f------ burrito."<br /><br />Performance-wise, the cast doesn't exactly cover itself in glory but I don't think it embarrasses itself, either. Besides, these characters are across-the-board over-the-top, which then gives us license to sit back and be more forgiving. Danny Trejo plays Machete just right, as a silent and implacable and sort of mysterious man of action. The humor is overt, perhaps to the detriment of narrative cohesion. But I really liked the riff on how everyone automatically admits a Mexican into their homes, providing he shows up with gardening tools. And Rodriguez's good luck charm and staple, Cheech Marin, is always worth a watch. MACHETE is a wild nudge in the ribs. It is packed with outrageous mayhem and cartoon violence. It even takes a semi-serious stab at a relevant issue, or relevant at least here on the left coast. And maybe on the U.S./Canadian border. I hear the Mounties are cracking down hard on any Yank trying to sneak across their border. Those health care benefits are so damn seductive.<br /><br />I guess MACHETE earned enough good will, because a sequel, MACHETE KILLS, has been greenlit and is already shooting. It looks to feature Mel Gibson, Charlie Sheen, and a reprising Michelle Rodriquez. There's a rumor circulating that Tony Jaa may even be in it, if he's done being a hermit in the woods. There's an eye towards a 2013 release. I'd Facebook Danny Trejo for confirmation, except we already know that "Machete don't text."<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- 5 Deleted Scenes (totals 00:06:32 minutes and includes two scenes which features Sartana Rivera's twin)<br />- Watch MATCHETE with the Audience Reaction Track<br />- 2 MACHETE theatrical trailers</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>This one is not only "sharp", it is also a true "cut-up" (no puns intended).  Take a simple plot such as "closing the borders" and turn it into a thriller...with comedic undertones and lots of GORE (but not overdone).  Robert Rodriguez is at his best.  If you recall, he also directed "Terror Planet"...the first of a double feature on the "Grindhouse" DVD...and "Sin City".  "Machete" is much better...a great cast...lots of beautiful women...shoot-em-up scenes...revenge...twists...and special effects.  How can you miss with Danny Trejo as "Michete" and a supporting cast of Jessica Alba, Robert De Niro, Jeff Fahey, Steven Seagal, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and (yes) Lindsay Lohan.  All 5 stars...but don't let the kids watch this one...too much violence, realistic revenge, and adult themes.  Put the popcorn in the microwave...have a bottle of beer or glass of wine...and enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>I love Danny Trejo as a character actor and have for years.  It's about time that he got a lead role - and I'm glad that it is in "Machete" - a role that fits him perfectly.<br /><br />What a rock 'em, sock 'em, cut 'em up movie - loads of grindhouse fun.  Trejo was perfect as the ex-Federale vigilante freedom fighter.  Oh, and of course, ladies' man!  The cast is full of big names and beautiful women.  The dialogue goes between bigoted, political vitriol and over-the-top sound bites.<br /><br />Violence - and I do mean violence which includes blood, GUTS, and everything in between; nudity; drugs.  Do you get the hint that this isn't a children's film?<br /><br />But I loved it for what it was - a tribute to drive-in movies, splatter films, Mexploitation films, maybe chambara films.  And let's have Trejo in more lead roles!</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>Another movie that was designed to be bad. This movie is patterned after the other Grindhouse type films with nudity, killing, guns, excessive blood, bad acting, bad dialouge, and a plot that doesn't make much sense. In this film Rodriguez thankfully parts way with the Drive-in intermission as well as the fake burning film, and film noise.<br /><br />Danny Trejo, who makes Steve Tyler look like a pretty boy is the main hero is this film. Jessica Alba plays an immigration agent. Steven Seagal, using various bad Mexican accents plays a drug lord. DeNiro is a state senator who, along with his aide is in cahoots with the drug lord as well as a vigilante group along the border. Michelle Rodriquez leads a group of poor Mexicans, all with cell phones.<br /><br />The plot is immaterial. In one scene the car starts on fire before it hits anything...then explodes. Lindsey Lohan goes topless and later dresses in a nun's outfit, packed with a gun. (Plot Spoiler?) She goes to shoot DeNiro, and says, "In the name of my father" BAM! BAM! then says "I forgot the rest." In the end, all alliances break down and everyone tries to kill everyone.<br /><br />Alba is also naked in the shower with her arms and legs strategically placed. She is best in the deleted scenes as her own twin sister which we never see in the movie. Every time Alba comes home she finds her in bed with some guy. Her twin calls her a "B" word and Alba responds by calling her a "slut."<br /><br />There is nothing believable in this movie, nor should we expect it. Oh yes, and the nurses wear very short smocks.<br /><br />There are no orientals in school girl outfits. I wonder how they missed that?</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>Machete was bonkers from beginning to end; it was sexy, gory and outrageous! Not only did Rodriguez craft a truly entertaining little Mexsploitation film but he had "something to say" as well by effectively portraying the ugly anti-immigrant sentiments, as he sees them, currently being encouraged by politicians in places like Texas and Arizona. I'll be damned if Senator John McLaughlin wasn't a shot at Senator John McCain but I could be wrong again. This isn't just exploitation, in my opinion it has a powerful message and that's not something you're going to hear everyday in regards to a film in which a naked girl extracts a cellphone from her vagina!<br /><br />The acting was all well above average, Chingon's score was ultra funky and the ironic role played by Lohan kicked this whole thing up a notch. Did it get better? The feminine play on Che, Frigga's one-eye, a luchadore hitman, the wink to Garko's Sartana and even the avenging nun of Ferrara's Ms. 45, oh yeah, all fantastico! Machete is a love letter to exploitation and trash fans and it makes no apologies for its offensive absurdity, nor should you. I really enjoyed this flick and I'll definitely be adding it to my personal collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Director Robert Rodriguez takes another stab and what has become a successful run of "grindhouse" films.  This move was initially shown as a trailer between "Death Proof" and "Planet Terror" when they appeared as a double feature a few years ago.  This is a brilliant idea as Rodriguez finds "A" list actors who elevate the style of the movie.  Granted this is stupid, dark and over-the-top violent but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  I had a lot of fun and certainly enjoyed seeing Lindsay Lohan in new light!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>While watching "Machete" I flashed back to other films tackling the immigration problem, "The Visitor" and "Frozen River".  What you say?  Isn't this a grindhouse picture? That said director Robert Rodriguez cleverly incorporates themes that are close to his heart into an action extravaganza that has a lot of heart and more than a passing tongue-in-cheek sensibility.  This movie is akin to the first installment of "The Transporter" where social themes are couched in what is essentially an action movie.  The film falls a little short of the classic grindhouse homage that Rodriguez achieved with "Planet Terror".  It's possible that Rodriguez captured the grindhouse ethos so succinctly in that film that he had nowhere to go but down.  One minor quibble is the acting prowess of star Danny Trejo.  Trejo is a fine character actor but when asked to carry the burden of lead he falls a little short.  The scars and pockmarks on his face say infinitely more than anything inherent in his performance.  Not to worry because Rodriguez surrounds him with an expert cast.  Who would have thought of Steven Seagal capable of giving a full bodied performance.  This made a better "trailer" than a fully realized feature.  That doesn't escape the fact that it is a consistently entertaining flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie is rather gory in some parts, but is a good movie if you're into slasher action. If you're a fan of Danny Trejo, this is definitely the film for you, as he is the star 'Machete' and kicks plenty of @$$ in this movie! You also get Jessica Alba and Steven Seagal playing supporting roles in this movie. Some of the scenes might be campy or overblown to some, but to me, it just adds some charm. Well, as much charm as a violent movie can have, at least. Plenty of explosions, shoot-outs, and confrontations make this a movie that you shouldn't be bored of. :P</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>After his family is murdered by a powerful drug lord (Steven Seagal), ex-Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) becomes a day laborer in the States until he is pulled into an underhanded plot to guarantee the election of an anti-immigration right winger (Robert DeNiro) to the Senate.  Much bleeding and nudity ensues.<br /><br />Writer/director Robert Rodriguez shares his colleague Quentin Tarantino's fascination with the exploitation cinema of the 70s, but Rodriguez has a purer vision.  He may not elevate his material with frequently inspired dialogue, but he also does not distract from his story with awkward, self-indulgent homages.  Rodriquez delivers a fast, entertaining, fun movie that one could imagine seeing in a grindhouse theater.  Trejo is the Mexican Charles Bronson that we didn't know we were waiting for.  It's a shame the guy is already 66 (!), because I'd like to see him crank out one or two hard and dirty thrillers a year for the next 20 years.  Even if I didn't see them, it would be nice just to know they were out there.

Easily the most morbidly hilarious film I've ever seen, I was cracking up at over-the-top triple decapitations within the first minute and shocked at the kind of material that was eliciting so many belly laughs. It's paper-thin by design, proudly heavy handed and clearly something everybody had the time of their lives filming, but the entertainment value does start to wane by the end of the second act. May have been more fulfilling as a joke trailer, though I'm sure I'll watch it again when I'm in the mood to shut off my brain.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>Machete<br />1 DVD Widescreen Disc, being released January 4, 2010<br /><br />"Machete" was directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis and is an expansion of a fake trailer for a film of the same name that was shown during the double feature "Grindhouse." If only more movies could be like this: cut into a trailer and the people either demand it or don't. Then stuff like the upcoming Vince Vaughn and Kevin James movie, "The Dilemma" wouldn't get made. I remember cheering for this trailer in the theater and the movie was pretty much what I expected it to be. The premise is that an ex-Federale is hired for an assassination, but is then betrayed by the people who hired him who are trying to get a Senator re-elected by getting sympathy from the voters. Machete goes on a rampage of revenge with the help of the network.<br /><br />"Machete" is best when it embraces its genre. The campiness, the ridiculous amount of violence, gunfire, explosions, and gratuitous hot babes are all elements of what makes this movie work. The only parts that take away from the movie are the moments of seriousness where actors try to do something deeper with their performances. For example, Lindsay Lohan plays a slutty daughter of the man who hired and wronged Machete. Her back story is pretty bad, basically she enjoys putting nude photos of herself online to get attention for modeling and later takes a turn that gets her in a nun's uniform with a gun. The journey from point A to point B is a little painful, but if she could have just let herself go a little and rattle off one-liner's without being self conscious about it, she could have done better.<br /><br />Danny Trejo as Machete has a face we all remember, though before now may not have remembered his name so vividly. He carries this movie with awesome action sequences and deeply buried emotions. He's a man's man getting it done and then randomly hitting it with hot babes who get naked for him. Does that part make sense? Heck no. Does it feel like a reward for years of supporting hitman roles? Hells to the yeah.<br /><br />Jessica Alba plays Sartana Rivera, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent trying to track down the network that helps immigrants led by "She" played by Michelle Rodriguez. Once Machete is framed for a crime he didn't commit and is able to gather evidence against his foes, Sartana switches gears to help him and get the real criminals who set this up behind bars. Both women walk the line of the tone of this movie very well. They hop between earnestly fighting for their goals, oozing sex appeal, and participating in crazy action scenes. Cheech Marin has a great short stint as the ass-kicking Padre.<br /><br />The baddies are former "Lost" cast member, Jeff Fahey who is the man behind the curtain of the hire-up and main betrayer of Machete. His steel blue eyes and deep voiced resolve are perfect for setting up the movie. Robert De Niro is a little silly as a cowboy Anti-Immigration Texas Senator McLaughlin, but that fits this movie too.<br /><br />What this movie did amazingly well as make sure to incorporate every scene shown in the original fake trailer! It would have been a little better at "Grindhouse" length, say 75 minutes or so and trimming down some of the fat (scenes getting too serious, slowing the story down). Definitely worth checking out for some crazy violence and action! For example, I looked away from the TV for a second and missed FIVE people getting decapitated at once. Whoa.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is an audience track so you can listen to other people laughing and reacting to Machete decapitating people. There are five deleted scenes, some of which are a big surprise! Turns out Jessica Alba's character had a slutty twin whom she walks in on in bed with some guy often enough to be in two cut scenes. There are more scenes with our DeNiro politician where elements of the plot are explained to him (when they don't need to be).</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>I have had friends tell me they didn't like this movie because it seemed a little too fake, but I understood going into it that it was intended to seem that way...sort of in the 70s shock picture style, kinda like Rodriguez & Tarrentino's grindhouse picture movies Deathproof and Planet Terror.  It isn't exactly one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen, but I still thought it was pretty awesome...totally a guy movie.  If you can handle a bit of gore and some language & some full fledged nudity don't bother you, I definitely recommend giving this movie a watch...just watch it without the kids, because definitely not appropriate for their eyes and ears!  Beyond that though, this movie is pretty cool!

Danny Trejo plays a former Mexican Federale hired to assassinate a US senator played by Robert De Niro. Machete is a man of few words, deadly with weapons, and he is also a lady's man. This is the prolific actor's first leading role, and though the film is flawed, Danny Trejo is perfect as the vigilante hero.<br /><br />Part homage to exploitation movies, "Machete" is one-joke sketch turned into a 105 minute film. While the thin storyline is the film's obvious weakness, its strength lies in the cast including Jessica Alba, Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan, Cheech Marin, Michelle Rodriguez and Steven Seagal. With a cast of mostly B-list actors (and former A-listers), violent and sexy "Machete" certainly makes it point in its ultra-gory pre-credit 15 minutes, which is the best (or to some, worst) part of the film.<br /><br />But like most Robert Rodriguez films "Machete" tends to be slack and even dull when it forgets what it sets out to do. We know this is entertainment and we shouldn't take the film seriously, but some actors seem not to see things that way. The subplots about "Sh&eacute;" and Alba's agent (with her not-so-convincing speech) only slow down the film. The confusing climax with so many characters shooting each other is a letdown. The filmmakers need better action choreography.<br /><br />"Machete" belongs to perfectly cast Danny Trejo. I hope he will come back in "Machete Kills" and "Machete Kills Again," but please, next time with a better script.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>Machete is a fun movie, maybe a little less blood violence and more art would have made it better.  Some of the obnoxious humor was a bit much but does add to it's entertainment.  Seagal has a small role and would have been nice to see him more in the film since it was his first theatrical release in nearly 10 years.  Different type of role for Robert De Niro to play and main character Danny Trejo also had a small role with Seagal in Urban Justice.  Lindsay Lohan helps round out an interesting cast as well.  Not a family movie but for someone who likes a combination of humor and action then think you could enjoy it.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>Another movie that was designed to be bad. This movie is patterned after the other Grindhouse type films with nudity, killing, guns, excessive blood, bad acting, bad dialouge, and a plot that doesn't make much sense. In this film Rodriguez thankfully parts way with the Drive-in intermission as well as the fake burning film, and film noise.<br /><br />Danny Trejo, who makes Steve Tyler look like a pretty boy is the main hero is this film. Jessica Alba plays an immigration agent. Steven Seagal, using various bad Mexican accents plays a drug lord. DeNiro is a state senator who, along with his aide is in cahoots with the drug lord as well as a vigilante group along the border. Michelle Rodriquez leads a group of poor Mexicans, all with cell phones.<br /><br />The plot is immaterial. In one scene the car starts on fire before it hits anything...then explodes. Lindsey Lohan goes topless and later dresses in a nun's outfit, packed with a gun. (Plot Spoiler?) She goes to shoot DeNiro, and says, "In the name of my father" BAM! BAM! then says "I forgot the rest." In the end, all alliances break down and everyone tries to kill everyone.<br /><br />Alba is also naked in the shower with her arms and legs strategically placed. She is best in the deleted scenes as her own twin sister which we never see in the movie. Every time Alba comes home she finds her in bed with some guy. Her twin calls her a "B" word and Alba responds by calling her a "slut."<br /><br />There is nothing believable in this movie, nor should we expect it. Oh yes, and the nurses wear very short smocks.<br /><br />There are no orientals in school girl outfits. I wonder how they missed that?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>MACHETE<br /><br />As any one who knows me can tell you I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan and a huge Robert Rodriguez fan, so naturally I love their work. This film being another Grindhouse type film especially since it was based on a trailer for that film is really fun. Any one who does not like violence, naked women, and violence should stay away. Also add in that I am a huge Steven Seagal fan and that this film was filmed here in Austin Texas, you know I loved it. This of course being another film QT and RR collaborated on, and yes they did QT was an uncredited producer. It should also be noted that Danny Trejo played this character in the three Spy Kids movies.<br /><br />Machete [Trejo] is a man who has some what lost his way in life ever since a drug kingpin named Torrez [Seagal] killed his family. Since then he does hard manual labor for money until he is offered a hit. The hit of course is on a Texas politician [De Niro] who has a thing against illegal immigrants in Texas. When the hit goes bad as he was set up he goes back to his federale days and goes into kill mode. As the rampage goes on and every one from politicians, to priests, underground rebels, and US agents get involved the big players start to come out. That of course being the reemergence of Torrez as he is linked with Senator McLaughlin [De Niro], turns out they have a plan to own the drug trafficking in and out of Texas.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully entertaining Mexploitation flick and is one of the best times I had at the movies all year. Every thing any one could want is in this movie, from great over the top action to some great romance [Machete sex music begins to play here]. The great over the top action is brilliant but one of the best parts has to be the exit from the hospital, any one who has seen it knows what I am talking about. The blood and violence of this are actually extremely well done, it is overly fun but at the same time isn't overly campy if that makes sense. In fact like many have said the opening scenes of the film let you know exactly what type of movie this is.<br /><br />Danny Trejo is wonderful as if you didn't know as Machete and is right at home in this flick. He has been doing these types of roles for Rodriguez for years; in fact he has played Machete in the "Spy Kids" flicks. Jeff Fahey is masterful here looking like he is straight out of "Pulp Fiction" and having a weird thing for his daughter, and Robert De Niro looks like he has never had more fun in any other role. Now of course you know from the trailer that the ladies are here and looking oh so good while being oh so bad. Michelle Rodriguez has never looked hotter, man I love her so much, plus her character is really cool. Jessica Alba is fun here as well and to be honest surprised me a bit, she was kinda funny. Lindsey Lohan was another surprise here as I thought she did a good job with the time she got on screen.<br /><br />Of course Cheech Marin is always great and here provides a lot of great and humorous scenes. But with every one in this [all of which were great and fun] I am going to have to say Steven Seagal stole the show a bit. Now I know all kinds of people are going to disagree with me but I thought he was hilarious. His last scene with Trejo is brilliant with the sword fight and all that, but his final bit of dialogue and actions are priceless. I have never laughed so hard ever, it was truly brilliant.<br /><br />Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis and written by Robert and &Aacute;lvaro Rodr&iacute;guez this movie was extremely fun, funny, and over the top. There are also some messages about this country and its politics but they don't beat you over the head. The style of the flick is much like that of the EXCELLENT "Grindhouse" film that RR and QT gave us so you know it looks great and has a great feel. I do recommend this flick to any and every one, BUY IT when it is released. I will be picking it up the second it is released, you should do the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A heartfelt and entertaining contribution to the immigration debate. Also a freakin' awesome modern Grindhouse-style movie with the budget to make it look good and a bunch of stars pretty obviously enjoying the liberation the material affords them to chew the scenery.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>A very entertaining action movie. The violence is so graphic, but not in a disgusting way.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining, funny, weird, and sarcastic.<br /><br />It has a very "Tarantino" Feel to it.<br /><br />If you're hanging with a bunch of friends and looking forward to watching an action fun movie, Machete won't disappoint you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>I wanted badly to enjoy this film, because the tailer is so great and because Danny Trujo has deserved a starring role in a film for such a very long, long time... but the plot was just too hammy. Best scene was when Machete was making out in the pool with the topless wife and daughter of his adversary. Too many meatheads in this film, in particular the racist homicidal maniac senator (typical, typical) played by Robert "who believes he will ever be in a good movie again" DeNiro. Danny Trujo is good in the film, although they give him too little dialogue - the "strong silent type" thing doesn't work forever. Jessica Alba nearly ruins the movie with her stupid participation, and Michelle Rodriguez doesn't really spice it up much except as eye candy.  Looking forward to Machete Kills and Machete Kills again - I just KNOW that they can do better.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is awesome it has a well round cast from Robert De Niro, Steven Seagal, danny Trejo, jessica Alba and micelle rodriguez. This movie is packed with none stop action, hot women(Jessica Alba. What can i say more than that Machete is a blast to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This is a film which combines the talents of a strange mix of actors.  I mean, you have 2 A Movie actors (Robert Deniro, Jessica Alba), 2 former A Movie actors (Steven Seagal, Jeff Fahey) and one thespian whose career is still in a sort of limbo (Lindsay Lohan).  Bring them all together and you have an ultra-fun, over-the-top B movie!<br /><br />The film centers around the rather sensitive topic of illegal immigration.  Namely, Mexicans illegally crossing the Rio Grande into Texas, and tempers tend to flare on both sides.  In the middle of it all is a hero (played by Danny Trejo) who prefers wielding a machete to a machine gun.<br /><br />Seagal's character seems to be more of a spoof than anything else.  It's Seagal's opportunity to portray just the type of thug that he relentlessly went after in his early movies (before his acting career dropped off the map).<br /><br />For those of you scoring at home, Lindsay Lohan does NOT appear topless in this film.  Sad to say, but a body double is in the film in place of her in the swimming pool scene.  Sorry ~ I'm just the messenger on this.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a mostly mindless movie that has plenty of violence & a little bit of nudity sprinkled in, then this movie might be for you.  If you like movies where the ugly guy always gets the hot babe, then this film is a MUST!!</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>"Machete" is a 2010 film with Danny Trejo in the lead role as a mercenary / vigilante style hero against corruption and crime.  I bought this DVD movie because it also stars Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Shea Whigham, Lindsay Lohan, Electra Avellan, Tom Savini, and Alicia Rachel Marek.  Well that, and it being rated "R" I was hoping for some actresses who make up for not being much else but visual effect.<br />This is a hilarious, over done, cult classic, campy, poorly acted, poorly directed, and extremely lame masterpiece that doesn't need substance to be more than well worth your time and money.  I busted up laughing out loud at this several times and got everything I was hoping for in every category by watching this film.  The hokey FX, the blood and guts, the fleshfest buffet, and I don't want to spoil the movie for you entirely but you'll have to crack up laughing when Danny Trejo uses a very special "rope" to jump out a window and swing back, crashing into the window below.  The corny dialogue along with the low-budget style sets and directing make this movie absolutely a keeper.  After watching a few movies not worth watching that I regret owning and intend to trade in, it is a breath of fresh air to have my own copy of "Machete" so I can view this trophy over and over.<br />I recommend "Machete" as a cure for the doldrums, and encourage anybody who needs a good laugh to view this as soon as you get a chance.  Five stars.  So bad it's great fun.  It is altogether obvious the cast had a great time making this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this film ... but it was just too over-the-top in trying to be "grindhouse." I loved the Grindhouse films of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAE7O0">Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R7HY0K">Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, but this one -- despite its excellent cast -- just didn't do "it" for me. Especially shoddy was Jessica Alba who made me wonder if she really had to try hard to be that bad of an actress. The action is plentiful and the gore is hilarious; and I realize that that was Rodriguez's aim. However, there's something about it that I wasn't too taken with. There's absolutely no "rewatching" value to this film even though it delivers on the action. Whereas "Grindhouse" pulled off the cheesy acting along with the action superbly, "Machete" just feels like a wasted exercise in trying to reach the same goal. Plus, it hits a little too close to the real-life border wars that are going on right now in the south/Mexico. I'm not political at all which is why I think I didn't appreciate Rodriguez taking a political hot topic and using this film (of all films) to make his own political statement (albeit in a cheesy fashion: "We didn't cross the border! The border crossed us!") It's good for a rent but I wouldn't buy it!</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I wasn't a fan of the Grindhouse pictures a few years back, though some of the trailers for non existent movies looked fun.  Still waiting for Nazi werewolves from Zombie and Thanksgiving from Roth.  Machete didn't really grab me because it looked too similar to every character that Trejo has played.  Granted because of his look he is pretty limited in what he can do.  The movie is a throwback to the 70's complete with the scratchy film.  Ultra violent with a bit of nudity.  I believe Trejo beds every major female lead in the film.  It is fun and over the top at time, but for the most part it fails.  It certainly bashes the right politically.  To me it just feels too long.  It seems like a fun idea for about 30 minutes which would have been great if he had taken 3 short concepts and made a 90 minute 3 short film feature.  It just didn't hold me.  I hung in to see a naked Lohan and to watch a fat Steven Seagal go in and out of a Spanish accent.  Also hold off buying this movie since I heard there will be an unrated cut with lots of extras coming out in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>Machete is the byproduct of a trailer shown with Grindhouse, the Tarantino/Rodriguez homage to exploitation cinema.  But while the Grindhouse pairing almost tried too hard in mixing original storyline with its homage, Machete revels in exploitation film conventions.  The result is a mix of over the top action, ridiculous violence, and gratuitous sex and nudity.  It makes no attempt to be deep, even though it has some biting satire towards immigration policy.  The film is ridiculous fun.<br /><br />The film's greatest asset is Rodriguez's slight of hand film making.  This film was made for 10 million, and while it has an intentional cheap feel, some of the actions scenes could have easily being pulled from a 100 million dollar blockbuster.  The action is very funny and very stylized.  An early use of interesting props in a hospital is the tip of the iceberg for me.<br /><br />The characters are equally fun.  Machete is a typical action here whose actions speak much louder than his words.  Danny Trejo is a perfect fit for this role, as he looks cold and serious, but is able to deliever the over the top action and such fun lines as "Machete don't text" without cracking a smile.  The supporting cast is equally impressive, particularly Robert De Niro, a proponent of immigration form who takes his disdain for immigrants to new highs.  De Niro plays a very stereotypical white politician with a slight southern accent.  De Niro's performance has a perfect subtle charm to it and as goofy as this movie can be, is probably one of the better roles he's had in a while.<br /><br />The story is not important and is actually the weakness of the movie.  It involves Machete being set up to look like he wanted to murder De Niro's character.  But as characters flood the movie, the story gets a little muddlded.  This never stops it from being fun, but can make the film a little more busy than it needs to be.<br /><br />Don't go in expecting something deep and appreciate the film for what it is and you will enjoy it.  Flawed, yes, but this as fun a Robert Rodriguez movie as you can hope for.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Don't take MACHETE (the film) seriously.  But you'd better take Machete (the man) seriously--because he means business.  He is a former Mexican Federale whose life is ruined by a drug lord (Steven Seagal, of course), hired by a corrupt senator and his underling (Robert De Niro and Jeff Fahey, respectively).  Pursued by a beautiful immigration agent (Jessica Alba) and a seductive but deadly freedom fighter (Michele Rodriguez), Machete must fight to save his honor--and the lives of his people.<br /><br />The performances are surprisingly strong throughout.  The film rests on Danny Trejo's broad, tattooed shoulders; fortunately, he IS Machete, with the tough attitude (and a surprising level of sensitivity) to carry out this role, even making it slightly more complex than it requires.  Seagal's Spanish is atrocious, but he is the embodiment of cool, even if he is far past his prime (I won't say his acting is good; it's Steven Seagal we're talking about, after all).  De Niro has made a lot of schlock lately, but he's clearly enjoying making a movie that's INTENTIONALLY campy.  Fahey oozes sleaze and cool; his slick-backed, gun-toting crime lord persona is arguably one of the better ones to grace the genre.  Alba and Rodriguez are both solid (Rodriguez usually is; for Alba, this is a pleasant surprise); it's nice to see female characters that avoid the typical eye-candy action role.<br /><br />MACHETE is basically Robert Rodriguez at his best: pulling no punches, taking nothing seriously, just having a grand, gory good time.  It's an action movie with no logical plot or plausible character development; it's a movie where Lindsay Lohan appears in a nun costume, for God's sake (all of the puns intended).  We've also got Cheech Marin as a gun-toting preacher ("God forgives; I don't"); Don Johnson as a murderous vigilante; and Tom Savini as a professional assassin.  We've got a script that is good for what it is (and that's all it's supposed to be); and the co-directing by Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis is frantic and fast-paced.  There are a few slow spots (hence the four stars) that hinder the movie, but ultimately, if you're a fan of grindhouse cinema (or just like a good, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred action thrill ride), MACHETE is a movie you will thoroughly enjoy.</p></br></body></html>

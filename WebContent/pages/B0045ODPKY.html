She claims a set-up, and must either prove her innocence, or carry out the assassination, depending on what the truth is. The agent's role is difficult to determine throughout, and despite some implausible stunts typical of such action fare, this is good summer popcorn fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>This is probably as amusing as the so-called summer genre of action movies can get. Don't take it serious, don't worry too much about plausibility, just go with the flow.<br />The film has two legs: crazy, stunt-driven, violent, spectacular action, and a classical spy - counter spy puzzle. Who is working for whom, who are the good guys and who the bad ones, is there a difference anyway?<br />Jolie's character (?) Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent, married to a German arachnologist in Washington. She gets exposed by a former Soviet spy master as a Soviet sleeper agent, planted in the 1980s together with dozens of others, to cause havoc in the US at a yet to be determined time. The time has come. Assassinations of the visiting Russian President and then of the American President are on the agenda. Plus a nuclear attack on some targets.<br />For most of the time we wonder if she is a Soviet spy or an American spy posing as a Soviet spy or a Soviet spy posing as an American spy posing as a Soviet spy. You know, the Escher thing.<br />A sequel is guaranteed.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Just because I issued only 3 stars to SALT, doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie. It is definately worth watching and entertaining depending on your taste in movies. Yet, in recent years, Hollywood, screenwriters and movie producers have taken a poor step in the keep em' happy direction. 'Keep em' happy' in the sense of the movie shouldn't stop. The audience paid for action and their gonna get it.<br /><br />Well, the audience is getting action, but at the expense of character development and setup and explanation and just plain mood. There is little to zero effort by the filmmakers to let us know what is going on inside the main character, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />The movie opens up with a violent scene of interrogation as Salt is beaten by N.Korean soldiers, accused of being a spy as she repeatedly assures them that she isn't a spy. The audience affectively wonders if maybe she isn't a spy and she is a victim of mistaken identity. Yet, as the scene breaks and she is escorted back to an American helicopter, released by some high power, the movie then jumps to a scene where we discover, quite unceremoniously that, well, she is a spy and an agent for the U.S. government.<br /><br />This pretty much sums up the entire movie from that point on. There are many twists and turns in SALT, but none of them have an ounce of setup or tactic to keep the audience guessing. Everything is right in your face and gets straight to the action, as if the entire movie viewing world weren't smart enough to be toyed with.<br /><br />None of the twists and turns in SALT, and there are many, garner a gasp, or surprise or any reaction other than, "where's the popcorn?"<br /><br />A good movie that will fall, if it hasn't already, into the pile of movies that will not be thought of ever again, 3 weeks after its video release.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>I had very little interest in seeing this when it came out.  Reviews proclaimed that Angelina Jolie was the female Bourne - and I assumed that meant Lara Croft with a bit more smolder and sweat, in a slightly more realistic setting.  No thanks.<br /><br />But I was wrong.  I really liked this.  Salt is every bit as intense as the Bourne trilogy, and Jolie pulls it off with style.  It's not at all plausible, but neither is Bourne; and in both series the non-stop action kept me so engaged I never had time to wonder whether it made any sense until afterwards.  While it's happening it's simply intense and exciting, and kept me guessing.  I did anticipate the major twist towards the end, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.  The basic set up - of a defecting KGB agent, who tells the CIA that Salt is a sleeper double agent, allegedly as his only way to get her activated and give her a mission - is pretty far fetched when you stop and think about it.  The action also, is over and above what's humanly possible - but it's rendered so precisely that you don't get lost while it's going on.  What struck me, afterwards, is that Salt managed to achieve the same intensity as, say, the Bourne Ultimatum, but without the lack of clarity that you find in that film due to the shaky camera and jump cuts.<br /><br />Salt's a fun flick - an intense and exhilarating, non-stop, keeps-you-guessing spy game.  It looks great on Blu-Ray, and includes an extended edition and director's cut.  The director's cut is the best - it adds a bit more graphic violence, but also gives a bit more clarity about the characters and their relationships.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>"Salt" is a film that was bashed by film critics, because it's an action film. Once again however, this action film is not as bad as the critics say it is.<br /><br />The basic plot for "Salt" is focused on character Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) who is a CIA agent. One day while interrogating a Russian defector, he tells her that a person by the name of Salt is going to assassinate the Russian president. In hearing this, the CIA decides to keep Salt in the interrogation room, to ask her some questions. She decides to run away which begs the question, is she a spy?<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is the kind of actor where if she has a good script to follow like "Changeling" directed by Clint Eastwood, she is very good. "Salt" has a good plot, in which Angelina shines.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Don't expect a masterpiece. It is not. But it is a good action film and you can enjoy it a lot provided you accept the clich&eacute;s that come with the genre.<br /><br />Of course the first agent shown as the victim of the monstrous communist North Koreans has to be the good one, even if it is a double or triple agent. In the same way the first American agent shown as snow white and crystal clear has to be a traitor and a double agent.<br /><br />So what is the difference of this film as compared to Bourne, Stallone and Terminator?<br /><br />The first element is that there are so many levels of secret agents that ignore one another that the Russians will inevitably lose. They have yet an easy task infiltrating the USA to the top, except the President of course; But this system at one moment has to fail, especially when they start taking hostage the people who are close to their agents and then killing these hostages in cold blood when the effect has been reached, or they think it has. Then the double secret agent has nothing left to lose.<br /><br />Infiltrating the USA is as easy as easy can be because they are a technological sewage or wasteland as for security and screening people and events. Even the procedure to start a nuclear war is so flimsy with confrontation of simple digital signals or alphanumerical codes via machines and nothing else is of course a farce.<br /><br />But good is always the victor in these films. The most positive element is that the main character is a woman, which will satisfy the transfer desires of girls and women in the audience to be able to identify with that demoniac agent impersonated by Angelina Jolie. That's a good change in the genre.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>It seems Angelina Jolie has found her comfort zone when it comes to making movies; special agents who live in a world of complex missions, unsure loyalties, high-tech gadgets, and gunfights.  Whether it be Wanted, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Tombraider, or now this 2010 release, her live-action movies seem to blend into each other.  In this one, she is an American, raised as a Russian spy, who joins the CIA, pretends to carry out her mission for Russia, while intending to save America.  Sounds complicated?  Well, the action scenes help to explain everything, and it does it at under 2 hours in length.  For fans of Jolie's physique, you will be disappointed as she shows no skin; in fact she is often wearing various disguises.  For fans of Bond movies, the Bourne trilogy, and the Mission Impossible films, this is right up your alley.  Overall, an average movie whose biggest distinction is that the star is a female; unlike the previously listed male-anchored films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed Salt from the get go.it's basically wall to wall action.yes there are no doubt plot holes,and logic gaps,but it's all about the action here.and it's so much fun.plus it's so fast paced,you don't really have time to think about logic or plot,unless you really want to.we just went with it and had a blast.and actually the story is generally well written and has some very clever sequences.if you can just turn your brain off for the allotted run time,you should really enjoy yourself.but if you need you movies to have a high degree of logic and realism,this likely isn't your cup of tea.for me, though,i loved it. 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Evelyn Salt isn't your fancy, high-kicking heroine. She does whatever it takes to get the job done. She doesn't give an ef about style points. In combat, her application of Muay Thai and Krav Maga allows her to dispose of her opponents directly and viciously and often permanently. Evelyn Salt is a highly skilled, highly lethal CIA operative. When she's set up and fingered as a Russian sleeper agent, her immediate concern is for her husband's safety. Evelyn Salt goes on the lam, and so re-enforces the accusation placed against her. The CIA goes on the warpath. But so does Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />Decades out of relevance, the Cold War strikes again. Somewhere, John Le Carr&eacute; and Robert Ludlum are smiling. SALT is an engrossing espionage thriller and so twisty it had me half-convinced that I'm a Russian mole. It's not long before you start questioning Evelyn Salt's every move. Who is Evelyn Salt? What's her true agenda? Where is her allegiance? You don't learn for certain until deep into the film, when Salt is put in a position to prevent a nuclear holocaust... or trigger it.<br /><br />This is old hat for Angelina Jolie. Her mojo is such that she carries the film effortlessly. I'm not even that surprised to learn that SALT, in its early stages, intended to feature Tom Cruise as "Evan Salt." Jolie belongs to an elite club. She's one of those very few actresses who is sexy, can act, and do some serious buttkicking. Off the top of my head, there are Jolie, Yeoh, Jovovich, Hamilton, and Weaver - and all have presence. Jolie has great acting chops. She commits to her role, not only tonally, but physically. Although, fine, I don't think she quite pulls off her disguise as a Russian officer. Still, it's an impressive sight watching a seriously pisssed Salt embark on a killing spree. Let me say, though, that it's just really wrong how, from the back seat of a speeding car, a captive Salt remote controls the cop driver thru rampant application of her taser (and yet I couldn't stop laughing). And like Yeoh and Jovovich, Jolie relishes performing her own stunts, so she's no wilting lily. Speaking of stunts, the most spectacular one involves Salt's various insane leaps onto the roofs of various trucks criss-crossing on the freeways. My jaw got all agape.<br /><br />Don't mean to dis the menfolk. Liev Schreiber lends gravitas as Salt's CIA friend and colleague who reluctantly joins in the (wo)man hunt. Dude is a good actor and makes a good foil for Jolie. Meanwhile, Chiwetel Ejiofor - playing a by-the-books government agent - becomes the Tommy Lee Jones to Jolie's Harrison Ford. SALT is more action-packed than it is cerebral. More BOURNE IDENTITY than THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. And with the cliffhanger ending positioning SALT to be another film franchise for Jolie, it looks like Tom Cruise made a booboo opting out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Salt is a very gritty and violent action thriller from 2010, and while it has a sparing amount of crude language, be prepared for a heavy dose of death.  We've seen the likes of this before, and usually there's some redemptive qualities that help make the level of violence more palatable.  In this case the female protagonist Evelyn Salt proves to be a cold blooded emotionless killer, and we see quite a trail of bodies in her wake.  The plot is quite suspenseful, because we're never entirely sure what side she and her surrounding cast are on.  The notion of sleeper agents is particularly interesting, but there are a few big holes in the story (e.g. why does Olsov go to CIA headquarters to blow Salt's cover?  Why doesn't she seem to know what he is talking about, but then cooperate fully with his plan?).  By the end you're left thinking that it was an okay ride, but not one you'd ever want to take a second time, or maybe even a first time. - GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>The true test of an action film is if the viewer can stop thinking and just believe it while watching.  This film definitely did that for me:  it is fast, scary, and for the most part just realistic enough.  A few scenes are over the top, but not many.  Spy action films can also be very fun in that they keep you guessing as to what is really going on, with clues, sudden choices, and shocking revelations.  This filkeeps you guessing more or less to the very end, changing the viewer's mind not once, but twice or even three times in what may be a record.  Good guys become bad guys and vice versa, but multiple times!  Even some (admittedly crude) politics come into it.  Of course, there is also a question of style, that is, how cool the characters are, how sexy.  Here again, Jolie proves herself a gifted, charismatic screen presence, one of the greatest woman character actors at the moment as well as a star.  She is sleek, strong, and sinuous, exuding both sensuality and hard concentration.  These elements work in this film eminently well.<br /><br />However, at the deeper level, that of emotional identification with the character, the film is weaker.  Sure, Salt has connections with her past and present that make themselves felt, but I did not empathize much with her mission and plight.  To be sure, that isn't required in an action film, but it is in the very best of the genre.  The supreme masterpiece that does this is the Bourne Trilogy, which reached a new level of realistic action with an emotional overlay.  Bourne sets a new standard that the new James Bond series accomplishes with some success for an old character, but Salt doesn't quite reach it - yet.<br /><br />Recommended.  I hope it becomes a series, because its potential is high and with a better script, we can expect much more.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>The fact that it's predictable doesn't necessarily mean it's bad or boring, just sort of lacking in surprises. Angelina Jolie plays the part of Evelyn Salt, a very remarkable super spy who's superior training enables her to either beat up or just outsmart every other spy most specifically including guys half again her size.<br /><br />If you're OK with that then you may be in for a rather fun action adventure featuring this remarkable woman. The theatrical version starts with a bang and the pace keeps going at a rapid clip for the rest of the movie. The movie appears to end with a sequel in mind; a sequel is under consideration by Sony but the jury is still out on Jolie's participation as I understand it.<br /><br />On balance the movie is entertaining but not great; if you're a fan of Jolie's you may want to add this one to your collection. If not, then watch it first to make a determination of whether or not you should own it. If you are a Jolie fan then the preferred version may be the Blu-ray Delux Unrated Edition.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This movie has plenty of action, stunts, and special effects, and the acting is generally pretty good, so it's reasonably entertaining.  However, the characters and plot stretch believability past the breaking point, with the result that I didn't find this movie very engaging and it left little impression on me when it was over.  I suppose I can recommend this movie to people who are in the mood for it, but there are definitely better movies available in this genre, so this isn't a top choice (despite having Angelina Jolie in the lead role).</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was an entertaining spy/action film.

I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. I watched the director's cut. Well, it was one of these fast-moving, high-action, violent movies with little depth of thought. It's also one of these post-cold war movies where  Russia and America are still locked into the mutual destruction thing. Yaawwwnnnn!<br /><br />Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, supposedly and American girl who's parents were killed in a Russian car wreck. She returned to America and eventually worked her way into high levels of the CIA. But wait, she was originally brainwashed (trained) to be a sleeper agent for Russia and was awakened in the US by the capture of her trainer during a questioning period. Well, she then reverted back to her Russian training and become a potential assassinator of the president of the US. Well, this story had more twists and turns than the Mississippi River and I just lost interest in this bizarre  and impossible fantasy spy adventure. It's a high adventure action flick and some of the stunts are really amazing and will hold your attention. Likewise, there's a lot of bullets flying, death and destruction. Jolie plays a one-wonan destruction crew, and not too convincingly. It's an interesting twist, however.<br /><br />The movie is hard for me to rate. The story/script is nonsense. The acting is reasonably good. The sets and stunts are spectacular. It held my attention and was good entertainment. Would I watch it again? No.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>I only saw the extended cut and re-watched with the voiceover filmmakers' commentary so I will not be reviewing the theatrical version.

The DVD I watched comes with the standard extras (more than most DVD's) and unless you do something the standard coming attractions.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is being pointed out as a mole (Russian sleeper agent) with a mission. This accusation automatically condemns her husband to death. So Evelyn must go rogue to save her husband and prove her innocence. Yes I know this story is been done before but never as well acted.<br /><br />Will Evelyn be able to track down the culprits before she is dispatched by her own people? And it appears that she still has a good friend on the inside; at least someone willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and that is fellow agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber).<br /><br />The film has plenty of action, lots of great background music, and veteran actors that do not overwhelm their character's personalities. You may be able to guess the plot, guess the twists, and guess the outcome as they did not go out of the way to mask these two well.

Sure some (or most depending on how well you know the thriller genre)of the twists in "Salt" are clever but what makes "Salt" a step above most mediocre thrillers is how the director unfolds his story. "Salt" is a good if predictable film where some of the cliches of the genre are turned inside out. "Salt" plays as a cross between "No Way Out" (itself a remake of "Out of the Past") and the Bourne movies and, although not as good as those films, manages to be an entertaining thrill ride with plenty of action so you don't really notice some of the holes in the plot until after the movie is over.<br /><br />Image quality is exceptionally crisp without being over process. The lossless audio sounds exceptional and is immersive. We get subtitles with this as well.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br /><br />Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt a CIA agent who suddenly finds herself being hunted when a rogue Soviet spy master named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski)shows up and states that she is a Soviet spy and is there to kill the Russian President who will be attending the funeral of the Vice President of the United States. While Salt denies that she is a Soviet spy everything including the fact that she goes on the run indicates to her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schrieber) and Counter Intelligence Agent Peabody (Chiewetel Ejiofor)that she is, indeed, a Soviet spy who has been living and working undercover for most of her life. Salt claims she has gone on the run because whenever a spy's cover is blown their entire family is taken out and she's concerned that the only person in her life her husband will be assassinated.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Directed by veteran thriller director Phillip Noyce ("Clear and Present Danger", "The Quiet American", "Rabbit Proof Fence") and written by Kurt Wimmer ("Law Abiding Citizen", "Street Kings")"Salt" plays with the expectations of the thriller genre with both Noyce and Wimmer knowing use the twists and turns of other films. What really sells "Salt" though are the performances and the stunts in the film as well as the ingenious flashback story that is integrated into the main film revealing almost everything about Salt well before the midway point of the movie. While these attributes don't save the movie entirely, it does make the film diverting and entertaining.<br /><br />There are some gaps in logic/the narrative but these are pretty easy to over look because you end up if you become involved in the movie. The ending which sets up a sequel wasn't quite as conclusive as it should have been as they could easily have left it open on the theatrical version but given us a bit more closure for the audience. Most films that leave an opening this large just don't work and it is a major Achille's heel for "Salt".<br /><br />You can watch the "Director's Cut" an "Unedited Version" or the theatrical cut of the film with the Blu-ray. You should note that the story unfolds and is resolved in a slightly different fashion with the "Director's Cut" rather than the theatrical cut. As to which one you enjoy most, it'll, again, depend on your expectations of the movie but most of the changes are fairly cosmetic (i.e., don't add or subtract from the overall impact of the film).<br /><br />There's also featurettes on the production of the movie as well as Noyce providing a commentary track that is quite interesting particularly when it comes to the decisions for the editing decisions made for the film.<br /><br />If you set your expectations aisde set up from the preview trailer, "Salt" is an enjoyable action flick (of course it has little to do with reality but when was the last time you saw an action flick that DID have something to do with reality) and you might want to give it a chance to "prove" it's case.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Isn't it amazing how we play the entertainment card to make excuses for preposterous films? We as audiences will buy into a whole host of cinematic flaws as long as there are sights and sounds to keep us amused, and in all honesty, I don't know whether or not I mean that as a criticism. Maybe it's just what is. "Salt," like so many summer action movies before it, is a fun thrill-a-minute stunt caper, and yet it possesses not a single shred of plausibility. It's one of those movies that gives you license to put your brain on autopilot; you're not supposed to question it, you're just supposed to enjoy it for what it is. I hope this isn't a copout on my part, considering all the other escapist summer films I've dismissed ("Eagle Eye," the "Transformers" films, "The A-Team"). The fact that it's a spy thriller may have something to do with why it works. Tales of international intrigue involving secret agents are generally successful.<br /><br />The plot: Trusted CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused by a Russian defector of secretly being a sleeper agent for the KGB, Russia's foremost internal security organization. He also says she will be involved in a plot to assassinate the President of Russia, who will be in New York City attending the funeral of the American Vice President. Although she denies the defector's claims, she realizes that she will be held against her will, which will endanger the life of her German husband, a spider scientist (a plot point that isn't as inconsequential as it might seem). Using every trick in the book, Salt escapes headquarters and goes on the run, claiming that she's out to clear her name. Pursuing her are Agents Winter (Liev Shreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor); the former is willing to believe her innocence while the latter is highly suspicious.<br /><br />One of the film's most ridiculous yet clever story points is an elaborate decades-old scheme by the Russian government to brainwash children into being KGB agents. Their goal: Raise them to blend in, have them infiltrate the United States, and then let them bide their time until X Day, an operation that will plunge the country into nuclear war with the rest of the world. You'd be hard pressed to find a better sinister plot in a James Bond film, with or without the silly gadgets and gizmos built into wristwatches and ball-point pens. What does any of this have to do with Evelyn Salt? Wouldn't you like to know? Let's just say that, whatever her association, she gets to take part in many death-defying stunts, including impressive acrobatic leaps from the tops of semi trucks and gas tankers, all moving along at average freeway speeds.<br /><br />Stories like this require a plot twist or two, and you'll get them both in "Salt." I will say that, given the formulaic nature of spy thrillers, the twists aren't all that surprising - one is, in fact, so predictable that I could tell it was coming as early as the first ten minutes. But what this movie lacks in surprises it more than makes up for in sheer action spectacle, aided greatly by decent casting choices. Jolie, still in her prime, has been amazingly versatile, with credits as diverse as "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," "Changeling," "A Mighty Heart," and "Wanted" to her name; it's always a good sign when an actor can convincingly touch you deeply in one movie and get your heart pounding in another. Schreiber and Ejiofor play fairly generic roles, but in all fairness, they do the best with what little they're given.<br /><br />The only disappointment is Salt's husband, Mike Krause (August Diehl), who's featured so infrequently that I couldn't bring myself to care about him. This is bad because he is an important character, not merely because of his field of study, but also because of his emotional ties to Salt. Flashback sequences showing the two together should have been enough, but for me, something was missing. Maybe it was just a matter of too little screen time; had he been more actively involved, had he been given more dialogue, something substantial could have developed. As it is, I don't think anything of great importance would have been lost if this character had been altogether removed. Let the spider thing work itself in differently.<br /><br />We need another mindless action film about as much as we need another reality show. But if they absolutely have to be made, then "Salt" is a good indicator of what they should be like. Yes, it's silly from start to finish. Yes, it doesn't bother with anything that's even remotely realistic. But boy, it certainly knows how to keep an audience entertained. The action is plentiful. The mystery is engaging. The characters are well-played. The suspense is palpable. It's a lot of fun. And here I go again, sliding that entertainment card from out my sleeve, slipping into a fairly weak hand. Are we too easily amused? Movies like this are enjoyable distractions, but I shudder to think this is all we have left when it comes to summer popcorn flicks. As is the case with real salt, too much isn't good for you - just a pinch will do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>This was a great movie!

She is about to go home to celebrate her wedding anniversary when a Russian defector shows up at the office, telling a story.  He says he is dying of cancer and has nothing to lose.  He explains that many years ago, the Russians developed a plot to ruin America, the "KA" program ("kill America", I guess).  They trained many, many children and then substituted them into American life as "sleepers", to participate in a well-orchestrated plot at a much later time.  When the time is right, these children would be activated.  The one assigned to kill the Russian president was Evelyn Salt!<br /><br />As Evelyn is interrogating the defector, the other agents are running a body scan on him which indicates he is telling the truth.  Uh oh.  They begin to look at Evelyn a little differently.  Meanwhile, she is concerned about her husband's safety and takes off to find him.  This begins Evelyn's chase and a ton of action.<br /><br />Is "our" Evelyn Salt really Agent Chenkov?  Or is someone setting her up?  Watch and see.  I think you will really enjoy this movie if you like action.<br /><br />BTW--Yes, there is a lot of BS in the chase scenes, where Evelyn would likely have been killed in real life many times over, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun!  They get up and keep on going--they are the ONE person in the whole world who could survive or could achieve something.  Get real--that's what you go to see--the so-called impossible stuff! Angelina does a great job in this high-action flick!</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This summer has had some outstanding summer movies, and Salt is one of them. It starts with Angelina Jolie in the title role, Evelyn Salt, a CIA spy. A Russian defector suddenly shows up at one of their front businesses. During questioning, he announces to one an all that the visiting Russian president will be assassinated - by Evelyn Salt, supposedly a deep-cover Russian spy. The fact that the 'defector' then kills two agents escaping the building never enters into some folks' wholehearted belief his story. They take her in for questioning, she busts loose (super-agent that she is), and the chase is on.<br /><br />I really can't say anything else about the plot. There are so many reversals than anything would be a spoiler, and you deserve to see them for yourself. Of course, Jolie completely takes command of the role, and of pretty much everything else in sight. I'm sure it will surprise no one that the role was orginally written for a male actor ('Edwin,' not 'Evelyn') but, when it came time to cast the manliest action actor they could find, Jolie's name topped the list.<br /><br />This movie stands well above its genre. There are plenty of fight scenes, some pretty amazing chases, and a satisfying ending that begs for sequels. More than just that, there's an actual plot, one that keeps you guessing almost (but not quite) to the end.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>High octane action galore but the story is uneven and even unsatisfying in certain parts.  Flashbacks to the love story give the tale some texture but it's not enough.  Jolie isn't very believable to me as an action hero when she starts going hand-to-hand with people bigger than her (maybe if she did judo instead of direct attacks) which takes away from believability for me.  I would only recommend this if you like action scenes over story or you just like looking at Jolie's pretty face.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: February 2011.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>For all it's flaws I found `Salt' to be a reasonably entertaining film.<br /><br />Following a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent who then goes on the run, we see Jolie shoot and fight her way out of numerous scrapes.<br /><br />This is one of those films you need to suspend your disbelief to fully enjoy as it has so many inaccuracies and far fetched aspects that you could very quickly wind yourself up by pointing them all out.  If you manage to do this you should be able to enjoy this for what it is; a fast paced, espionage action film where you don't need to think to hard to enjoy it.  You can guess the various twists and plot revelations very early on, but it doesn't stop them being enjoyable when they are revealed.<br /><br />Jolie is very bland in this film, as are all the actors really and Li ev Shreiber is probably the best actor on offer.  The direction is ok, nothing special and the stunts are adequate enough.<br /><br />All in all this is a perfectly serviceable spy action film and like I mentioned at the start, for all it's flaws (which are numerous) it does still manage to entertain, which is about all we can hope for.  Worth a viewing, just don't expect anything outstanding.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>- It's a James Bond movie with a female lead character.<br /><br />- It has some exciting action scenes but it's so implausible because of Angelina's small body. For example, the scene where Salt jumped over the rail of staircase and choked a bad guy with her handcuffs. So, I watched it with a bucket of salt!<br /><br />- The pace is fast.<br /><br />- The majority of the film is predictable.<br /><br />- In short, it's worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>For some reason, I didn't like this movie as well as I thought I would. The character of Salt changes her personality and looks three times, and I couldn't tell what she was supposed to be, because the movie is pretty confusing. In the beginning, she seems like a damsel in distress, and then later she turns into an action star. While interrogating a Russian defector, he mentions that Evelyn Salt is a Russian spy. The CIA believe it to be true, so she escapes and tries to find her husband to make sure he's safe. During the Vice President's funeral, the Russian President will be assassinated unless Salt can stop it.

Reminds somewhat of the old Charles<br />Bronson film TELEFON.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I'm far from a fan of Jolie's, but I found her to be extremely convincing in SALT, and despite a slightly implausible plot,  Noyce kept the action revved-up, and in-your-face, throughout. There are lapses in logic involving certain key scenes, though nothing as blatantly, far-fetched as  most of the 'plot' in THE EXPENDABLES ( which was still a very fun movie, by the way- mostly because of it's line-up of action stars ), but the fight choreography, and car chases were very solid. All in all, it's a more than descent adrenaline-rush of a pic.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I am not an action adventure film fan and watch few of them.  However, Angelina Jolie interests me.  When asked to play a "Bond girl" because of her great beauty, she replied that she was only interested in playing Bond. Bravo! She teams well with director Phillip Noyce in making riveting action sequences.  He stages them with split second precision and she executes them flawlessly. Whenever stunt people take over, you simply cannot tell.  It is seamless. She is also built right for the part.  She does not have a delicate build.  Her hands, arms, feet, and legs are believably those of someone who is honed to military like performance.<br /><br />The plot is as convoluted as it always seems to be in these entertainments.  It involves Russian moles in US intelligence and the USA suddenly believing she is one of these moles.  This puts her on the run from US intelligence, the Secret Service and the police.  "On the run" are the operative words and are really the jist of this film. She vaults from one edge of your seat situation to another.  If you need something deeper, it is not here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>When we first meet Evelyn Salt (Angela Jolie), she is being tortured in a North Korean prison.  The CIA, thanks to the efforts of her boss (played with deadpan charm by Liev Shrieber), and her German-born boyfriend, makes a trade to get her home.<br /><br />Flash ahead two years.  Salt is married to her boyfriend, and working at an unadvertised CIA location.  A walk-in Russian defector named Orlov claims that an old Soviet KA program of deep cover assassins has been activated to kill the Russian President on a pending visit to New York City.  When the defector names Salt as a KA agent, she goes on the run, triggering an action-filled thrill ride of quick but decisive physical confrontations, nifty improvisation, and narrow escapes.<br /><br />Salt will try first to reach her husband, then the defector Orlov, before pressing on to New York City and the assassination plot.  That plot turns out to have an unexpected sequel.  Evelyn Salt is not who she seems, but neither are several other major characters.<br /><br />Under Philip Noyce's steady direction, the non-stop action and Evelyn Salt's Jason Bourne-like sense of cool keep the audience moving past some significant plot holes to a thrilling, Mission: Impossible-type finish.  "Salt" is highly recommended as an entertaining throw-back to the era of Cold War thrillers.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"Salt" is satisfying if you like treadmill action and spies coming out of the sewers.  It has action and thrills, with an outrageous plot that keeps popping surprises.  Most of the crazy double crosses you can guess, but it is still fun to watch.  Angelina Jolie plays the Russian Mole CIA Agent, Evelyn Salt, with gusto.  She keeps your interest with fast-paced escapes, clever disguises and turn on a dime attack scenes.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Russian sleeper agents coming to bring down the United States.  The agents are brain-washed as orphaned children who are sent to adoptive families in the United States.  As they mature and reach responsible positions throughout the country, all come to life as evil agents with specific plans to bring down the USA.  Evelyn Salt is the only hope we have - oh my!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>At first glance, Salt  looked like it had a lot of potential to deliver a thriller that utilized both pulse racing action and a strong female lead. However, it's unfortunate that that's all the film really was. Other than Angelina Jolie beating the snot out of men twice her size for an hour and a half, the film offered little else.<br /><br />It makes sense that children who are trained to be Russian spies while they're young would be capable of doing extraordinary things that the average human being wouldn't be able to, but Salt seemed borderline superhuman at times. The ability to handle various firearms and making homemade bombs out of cleaning supplies is one thing, but climbing around skyscrapers and bouncing off the walls like Spider-Man seemed like a bit of a stretch. The way she'd steal things as she was passing by came off as more of an unlikely repeated occurrence of both luck and convenience rather than a skillful attribute.<br /><br />The storyline is also ridiculously outlandish. It includes such gems as Lee Harvey Oswald actually being a Russian spy named Alek and a rather predictable plot twist in the climax. One of the weakest parts of the film is how inconclusive Salt's motifs come off as. The film was probably trying to keep you guessing as to whether or not Salt was actually a spy up until the big reveal, but her actions appear more confusing than anything and are relatively unclear until the end. Then her reasoning behind her actions just seemed so one-dimensional and dull that you wonder why you even bothered to watch this thriller to begin with. Not to mention that the film has a bigger open-ending than Predators did earlier this year.<br /><br />Salt does deliver some fast paced, bone crunching action and features an incredibly strong female lead, but its preposterous and predictable storyline drags it down. Salt is way too similar to everything else Angelina Jolie has done to go out of your way and see. The bottom line is the film treads familiar ground that you've already seen before and has probably been done better. If you're dead set on seeing Salt, I strongly encourage you to wait until it hits DVD and Blu-ray. Otherwise, skip it altogether.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>SALT<br /><br />STARRING: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, Daniel Pearce and Hunt Block<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Kurt Wimmer<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Phillip Noyce<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 23 July 2010<br />Review Date: 30 August 2010<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone's new film The Expendables, showcases several prototypes of characters from the `one guy goes in and kills everyone', movies from the 80s. I agree with Stallone in feeling that there is a shortage of these types of films in general, let alone descent ones; the last good one I can remember offhand, being The Punisher (2004).<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has impressed me and no doubt Stallone as well, with her latest film Salt, where she shows that it doesn't take a man to walk into a room and kill everyone; she can do it too. And man, does she do it; with skill, style and sex appeal. Short of maybe Charlize Theron, no other actress could have pulled this role off.<br /><br />She is Evelyn Salt. She's a spy for the CIA. Or is she? A dangerous looking Russian man walks himself into the CIA headquarters to report that a Russian Spy living in America, will assassinate the president of Russia, during his visit to the states. Ready for the kicker? The creepy Russian man leers at Evelyn from across the interview table and informs her that she is said Russian Spy / future assassin!<br /><br />You can imagine the look of shock on the faces of her comrades, who are taping the interview from the next room; not to mention Evelyn's. Sadly, that's all I can divulge to you. Trust me, there's so much more to tell, that it's killing me not to - but you'll have to see it for yourself! Twist and turn after twist and turn. Some you may see coming, others you probably will not. Either way - you will have a blast watching her run for her life; the filmmakers leaving us in limbo as to whether we should be rooting for her or not.<br /><br />The film is over the top, sure. At times it's even a tad irritating, having you sitting there going, `Oh, come on." A knife being snuck into the CIA headquarters; unnoticed information on CIA agents' background checks; the Whitehouse being penetrated as easily as a few 17-year-olds sneaking into a frat party; leaps from helicopters and freeways and moving vehicles, and etc., etc. My personal favorite would be Jolie (to quote Woody, from Toy Story), "falling with style", down an elevator shaft, passing several floors with each jump, and grabbing onto a ledge just right each time. This is something they should have had her do in the Lara Croft movies, as it was done in the videogames; but they didn't, so never mind.<br /><br />Speaking of videogames, Salt could make a very interesting one indeed and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie is followed by a sequel. Videogames? Sequels? `One girl killin' everyone?" I know - sounds like it could be a too much, but the film works. It's very cleverly written and directed, and Jolie's butt kicking action scenes are matched evenly throughout the film, with dramatic ones sharing brilliant acting from her two co-stars, Live Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br /><br />Schreiber and Ejiofor both play CIA operatives that work with Salt, and are tasked with tracking her down when she has fled. Neither of them is entirely sure if they should trust her alleged innocence, as the film hurls them after her through suspenseful stimulated action chase scenes close to the flavor of those in The Fugitive and Enemy of the State.<br /><br />Director Phillip Noyce and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer know this genre like the back of their hand and the film proves it. A list of their best achievements would be unrelenting; but a short version between the two of them could include Law Abiding Citizen, Street Kings, The Bone Collector, Patriot Games and The Saint.<br /><br />In closing, having enjoyed the film a great deal, but also having pointed out how un-plausible some of the events were, I feel the need to defend it one last time. I can say that I have definitely seen action films that have pushed the envelope of believability a lot further than Salt, and offered us only phony acting in return to justify their means. At least most of the elements in this film could maybe happen; and the performances of the actors, only add believability to us finding those things being possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>OK, lets get this over with right now. Angelina Jolie is not one of my faves, but she has matured<br />and become 3 times more beautiful than she was 10 years ago. Its difficult to keep your eyes off<br />of her, she's mesmerizing.<br /><br />Now, this movie..... Oh man, where did they come up with this thing? Hard to write a review without<br />giving away the storyline but if you like spy thrillers, assassination plots, classic Russian intrigue<br />from the Cold War, threats of nucular (credit George Bush for that one) annihilation, and the movie<br />Soldier, you will no doubt love this thing.<br /><br />Jolie plays a CIA agent with bad taste in men, who works for Liev Shrieber who I hate. He is patently<br />smug throughout this thing, while Angelina goes about kicking the crap out of the whole city of NY. And<br />yes, the CIA does have offices in NY City, otherwise this story doesn't work if it takes place at Langley.<br />Oh wait, did I say this thing worked? Sorry about that. It doesn't work, its a mess, but its a fun mess<br />and a good diversion for 2 hours. The script is riddled with plotholes but most people wont care because<br />the action is so frantic, and Jolie is actually almost semi-believable. I wouldn't mess with her, and I<br />have a long history of messing with women who could kick my butt knowhudahmsayin?<br /><br />This flick didn't ping any latent Cold War tensions in my subconscious, but it was fun and that's what I<br />wanted out of it. 3 Spiders</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>If one female can bring in the summer action fare, it's Angelina Jolie. 2 years ago we got "Wanted", where she played the smokin' hot Fox (her name certainly is right), the smart and super-tattooed female who leads poor, depressed Wesley to a clan of assassins called The Fraternity. Now 2 years later, she returns with "Salt", which, as you could tell from the trailer, is your typical summer action flick. So if you're expecting anything deep like "Inception", do be prepared to be disappointed. But if you're like me, asking for just a summer action flick, then you'll be satisfied.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt works in a cubicle in a CIA-owned office building. It's her anniversary day, and she is trying to figure out a perfect way to hold her anniversary dinner with her arachnid-fascinated husband Mike. She is called to interrogate a mysterious Russian man when she finds herself in two troublesome situations: 1) Rumor is spreading that she is working with Russian Intelligence and 2) In 24 hours, the Russian president will be assassinated by a Russian spy upon giving a Eulogy at the Vice President of the USA's funeral. She must prove her innocence from this accusation, as well as stop this spy from assassinating the Russian president.<br /><br />So yeah, a typical summer fare plot. Obviously you know that half the movie will just be Angelina beating guys up, and this film does not disappoint in that aspect. Action-wise, this film has some great action scenes, including a particularly exciting car chase that involves Angelina jumping from truck to truck. Her stunt work is quite impressive too, and it has some of her best stunts she's performed since the Tomb Raider movies. She is in great shape evidently, and so therefore her action scene work is quite fun to watch. Acting wise, she really can act, and she shows it well enough here.<br /><br />So yeah, it's fun and all. Good twist near the end makes it worth it as well. So why 2.5 stars? Because really, this film is like a fast food hamburger. Enjoyable while consumed, yet after, you're left with a lingering stomach ache. After the film, you're left wondering why you watched it, just like after you finish eating a fast food burger, you're left wondering why you ate it, despite the enjoyment you got out of it.<br /><br />In short, It's worth it while it lasts, and that's mainly it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>CIA Officer Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) finds herself on the run after she's accused of being a Russian spy. The movie has plenty of well done action and Salt is also well acted.<br />  However, the movie just gets silly after awhile and I found the twist of who's bad and who's good rather predictable. While the film never hooked me enough to make me say in the end "I can't wait for more!". So Salt is hardly Bourne with a woman.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Angelina Jolie has definitely reached star status. She makes films that have a certain cerebral quality that the critics enjoy but she remains true to her fans, those that bought repeat tickets to see TOMB RAIDER, by making action films as well. And if nothing else SALT is a non stop action thrill ride that those fans will love but with enough story to satisfy the critics.<br /><br />Jolie stars as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who as the film starts has been captured by the North Koreans and then traded due to the insistence of her boyfriend, an arachnologist (he studies spiders) she was involved with. The two marry and Evelyn continues working for the CIA without his apparent knowledge.<br /><br />Move forward two years and Evelyn is about to go home for the night. But she and her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) are stopped before going to interrogate a man who has just turned himself in saying he was a Russian spy and knows of a big event about to take place. As she interrogates the man he tells her about a spy movement begun during the cold war when deep undercover spies were placed throughout the U.S. to be activated years later. That time is now. Viewing his statement as nothing more than talk, she begins to leave until he tells her the name of the spy who will assassinate the Russian president: Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />The team goes on high alert and Evelyn is place in a holding cell till they can sort through it all. The Russian is being escorted to a cell of his own but kills his guards and escapes. Fearful of what might happen to her husband, Evelyn breaks out on her own after a creative escape. She has to find him and protect him.<br /><br />While Ted continues to defend Salt, Agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (a sort of internal affairs agent) leads the chase to bring Salt back into custody and prevent what appears to be a legitimate threat to the Russian president. Set to deliver the eulogy for the recently deceased Vice President, the assassination could result in a world war.<br /><br />Salt is tracked to her apartment where she finds the remains of an abduction of her husband, her worst fears come to pass. She barely makes it out before the CIA comes crashing in but once she hits the streets they follow. A sequence involving Salt jumping from the top of one semi-truck to another makes for one of the best chase scenes filmed in some time.<br /><br />Salt makes her escape, changes her look and begins preparing...to assassinate the Russian president! This is where the film brings on a fantastic twist. Where we would normally think that since this is Jolie she has to be innocent, we're suddenly wondering if she really could be the spy they think she is, an assassin. And when she causes panic and blows up the floor of the church where the Vice President's funeral is taking place, bringing the Russian president down a floor and into her gun sights, who knows if she is innocent of guilty?<br /><br />But long viewing film fans will figure out pieces of the puzzle before the last minutes of the film. As Salt continues on her path, reuniting with the Russian agent we saw her interrogate, more deep cover spies are revealed. It seems there was more to this story. Perhaps hundreds of these spies were placed long ago and now the plan is to turn them lose in an attempt to destroy the United States. Will Salt be the one to bring this plan to its ultimate goal or is she really trying to stop it before it begins?<br /><br />You'll have to watch to find out in a movie that has the feel of a roller coaster ride, swinging you this way and that until you roll into the station. The action is non stop, enhanced by both fantastic stunt work and a fast paced musical score that adds to the mix.<br /><br />Jolie does a great job here and should win over new fans. She offers both a tender side to the character as she worries about her husband and a killer side that plots out the destruction of those set in her sights. Best of all she switches those emotions without words but with acting, a tough job to accomplish. Best of all she takes a predominately male type role and offers an incredibly strong female combatant to the spy genre.<br /><br />The ending of the film offers a surprise of its own. What appears to be the final twist in the tale is given another little nudge that means perhaps a SALT 2 is in the making. At least the possibility is there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Move over James Bond!  Stand aside Jason Bourne! Welcome Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />If there is one formula in Hollywood that seems to work, that is having actress Angelina Jolie as your action star. The actress has appeared in several action-based films such as the "Tomb Raider" films, "Wanted", "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" and her films continue to be box office hits but her role as Evelyn Salt may just be what Hollywood has been wanting and needing, a femme fatale, a spy who literally kicks ass!  And there is no doubt about it, Evelyn Salt kicks ass and the potential of her character is fantastic.<br /><br />In 2010, Jolie's spy thriller "SALT" became another dominating hit film in the box office for the actresss raking in over $293 million worldwide and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition" will be released courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on December 21st.  And for those who love the film, will enjoy more of Evelyn Salt as you get three different versions of the film.<br /><br />"SALT" is directed by Phillip Noyce ("The Patriot Games", "Clear and Present Danger", "The Bone Collector") and features a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer ("The Thomas Crown Affair", "Law Abiding Citizen", "Ultraviolet"), music by James Newton Howard ("The Dark Knight", "The Sixth Sense", "The Fugitive") and cinematography by Robert Elswith ("Duplicity", "There Will Be Blood", "Michael Clayton" and "Boogie Nights").<br /><br />"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition" comes with three different versions of the film.  While there will be two DVD releases of the film, one with the original theatrical edition and the other with a director's cut and extended edition.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release of "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition", It is important to note that there are three different versions of the film.  The original theatrical edition and the extended edition are literally two different films in which the story of both films tend to go on different paths right after Evelyn meets up with Orlov.<br /><br />The director's cut has a few slight modifications to the original theatrical edition with a voice over that changes the ending of the original theatrical version of the film.  So, in essence, each of the three versions of "SALT" have a different ending.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"SALT" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The picture quality of "SALT" is absolutely fantastic.  "SALT" is a film that looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.  The colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and plenty of detail galore.  The cinematography by Robert Elswit combined with the visual effects really make "SALT" look realistic.  From the scenes on the White House lawn to the visual effects to make New York look lively from high above to the detail of Angelina Jolie's hair and her teary eyes.<br /><br />I didn't detect any blurriness, compression artifacts, banding...no visual blemishes at all.  "SALT" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"SALT" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English - Audio Description Track Dolby Surround English Stereo.  Because this is an action film, you can expect a solid lossless 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack.  From crowd ambiance, glass shattering, cars crashing into each other, bullets hitting metal,  bullets zipping to trains on the tracks and many instances of things blowing up, there is a good amount of sound being diverted to the surround channels and just enough LFE that makes "SALT" really envelop the soundscape in your viewing area.<br /><br />There is not one scene that I can say this is where the best sound is because these action sequences are so frequent and numerous that you can expect an active soundtrack throughout the film.<br /><br />Dialogue is crystal clear, as with the music soundtrack coming from the front and center channels.  "SALT" features a wonderful lossless soundtrack that compliments its wonderful picture quality.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"SALT" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Added Footage Marker - A marker that is activated during the viewing of the film and points out the differences between the unrated director's cut and unrated extended cut as compared to the theatrical version of the film.<br />  * movieIQ - If you are watching "SALT" on a Blu-ray 2.0 player connected to the Internet, you can pull up cast information and other information about the film.<br />  * Spy Cam: Picture-in-Picture - While watching "SALT", you get a picture-in-picture sequence in which the filmmaker, producer or talent talk about the various scenes of the film and you get to see the behind-the-scenes making of various scenes from "SALT".<br />  * The Ultimate Female Action Hero - (8:04) Director Phillip Noyce, producers and cast talk about how Angelina Jolie is an awesome actress who is willing to take on fearless role.

"SALT" was an awesome film and on Blu-ray, it's even better because you get three versions of the film.<br /><br />But there is so much that I loved about the film.  For one, it was great to see a female heroine (or is she a villain?) and Angelina Jolie did a magnificent job!  According to director Phillip Noyce, Jolie wanted a Bond-like character and simply, the character of Evelyn Salt fit perfectly.  Also, a wonderful job by actors Liev Schreiber, Chiewetel Ejiofor and Daniel Olbrychski.  But it's hard to talk about these characters without spoiling the film, also its even more difficult to even talk about the original theatrical version of the film now that the Blu-ray release has these different versions.  And dare I say, the director's cut and the very different extended version were much better than the original.<br /><br />So, I'm not going to even bother discussing what I liked about the original film as this is one of those rare moments for a Blu-ray review where the original theatrical edition may not mean as much as you may have a liking towards the other two versions of the films.  I have to admit that when I watched "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition", I figured that this release would have wonderful PQ and AQ, especially since it was an intense spy thriller with so many action scenes, that was a given.  But I was not expecting a film that would literally feature a different second half and become a whole new different story.  It was wonderfully done and to be truthful, I kind of wished that the extended version was the original theatrical version.  But still both this and the director's cut of the film were well-done and a major improvement over the original.<br /><br />According to director Philip Noyce, the change of endings was the filmmaker trying to keep the focus of who is the ultimate villain to one character than the other.  He enjoyed both versions, I enjoyed both versions and I have no doubt that the viewers will too. Unlike other films which have various versions included on a Blu-ray disc. typically they don't exactly add much to the film but in the case of "SALT", these three different versions of the film included are quite substantial.  But for me, the extended version literally ends with a bang and has a memorable shot of Evelyn Salt.  A shame the extended version was not used for the theatrical version as it would have been a classic shot.<br /><br />And just when you think you have watched all three films and that you are done, there is somewhat of a fourth way to watch the film in which you can watch the film but have a picture-in-picture segment on the making of "SALT". You also get audio commentary for each of the three films.<br /><br />Granted, it's the same commentary but with additional commentary supporting those differing scenes or added footage.  You also get a good amount of special features, especially an interesting featurette by former spies from the CIA and KGB who talk about how life really was for a spy plus other featurettes such as radio interview, visual effects making of, disguises of Evelyn Salt and more.  And last, for the videophiles and audiophiles, "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition" is fantastic!  Awesome PQ and AQ to literally round out this magnificent Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed "SALT", you're going to love "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition".  Such a refreshing character and I am hoping for a sequel!<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>After watching "The A-Team", I was left with deep contempt to action moviemakers. "Salt" restored my confidence that an action movie could be educational, entertaining, and spiritually uplifting.<br /><br />From the start to the end, the scenario appeared logical, smart, and ingenious. From North Korea, to Washington DC, to New York, and Moscow, you get a sense of reaching around the globe in a matter of minutes. The severe torture of a woman by the North Koreans will leave you traumatized until the next and more painful episode ensues. In those brief and intense moments, my mind was split between the agony and sacrifices of a women involved in acting as a way of living and the parallel lifestyle of real official government spies. Either way you look at it, the insult outweighed the gain.<br /><br />The tortured and patriotic American spy is transformed in a snap into a traitor and fugitive  while the viewer was still recovering from her gruesome torture scenes. The apparently ruthless and calculated spy possessed a soft spot for building and guarding her love nest. The escape of the accused traitor and the chase by the feds occupied very good part of the action and never appeared boring or excessive. Without a single bone broken from jumping from the roof to the top of a moving truck, followed by another, and a third, the viewer will still be left gripped with dilemma facing an apparently innocent woman.<br /><br />The third episode of sneaking and disrupting a high level security funeral blended very well with the previous two episodes. You could easily forgive the moviemakers for exaggeration by making a lone and weak woman to cause such upheaval in such heavily secured settings.<br /><br />Then, in the wolves den, the weak and lone woman managed to take revenge for her lost love by eliminating those who did him and her harm. The scene of the Russian rebels in the Brooklyn harbor was as impressive as it could be. Dancing with wolves and getting out alive sounded within reach with smart planning.<br /><br />The questionable double spy or traitor will soon unveil other spies in her next assignment to steal the nuclear arsenal of America. In the White House, the long sleeper spy reveals his ugly face during a critical moment of nuclear survival.<br /><br />Putting a feeble yet determined woman at the center of action made the "A-Team" look miserably poor. The movie was filled with action, plotting, and twists of human nature that made is a real piece of art. Doctors should envy the neural scan that performed brain imaging without cumbersome magnets, specialized hospital rooms, or IV dyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>watched this film recently and felt it was decent, but hardly worth the hype. the action was it's selling points and machinary going down, but the film just didn't click with me like that.

This was like the Angelina Jolie version of The Bourne Idenity or whatever those movies are with Matt Damon.  They all bite the big one.  Most of the movie is just Angelina Jolie being chased by evil FBI guys, and so on and so on.  Alot of shooting and car crashes tailor made for brainded action movie fans who like to just zone out in front of a tv screen.  I wish they would just stop making movies like this.  Angelina Jolie should stick to intelligent dramas, she's better than this and all of the other Tomb Raider crap she got involved in.  I could'nt even sit through the whole movie, didn't care what happened because you just don't care about the character.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LAA9SCENXLKN.html">A2LAA9SCENXLKN</a><br/><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />I'm just gonna tell you right now the reviews I do today will be shorter than usual. Well, Salt was advertised as "A Russian Spy 'someone is framing me'" extreme cliche. I love cliches, I love cheese, and if corn can be done right I love it. I watch Godzilla ALL THE TIME. (I promise there will be some Godzilla reviews by the end of October, most likely the original or G vs. Megagirus.) Well...even if I would spoil the movie for you, I don't think I would be able to. But I can tell you, they try there hands at some sort of a twist. But don't trust me, because this movie was very confusing.<br /><br />And not the good confusing like Inception, more like the bad confusing, something that the more you pay attention the less you understand. Watch a few Nostalgic Critic episodes you'll understand. That's my main complaint, is that the whole movie is founded on a hole. No matter how much good stuff you put in the movie, no matter how much of it nor how good, WATER GO DOWN THE HOLE!!!! (Sorry, I just got finished watching Nostalgic Critic's Animaniacs tribute.) Now we talk about the action. Usually in a good action movie, all you need is jumping and explosions. In a great action movie, you get jumping, explosions and muscles. In a fantastic action movie, you get jumping, punching, explosions, muscles, guns, everything. In a MASTERPIECE, you have all that plus a fantastic plot to back it up. This...was mediocre. Jumping, that is it.<br /><br />Now, aside from that, the real part where this movie makes up for all the faults 80% is in the characters. Why only 80? Because it doesn't make it better, it just off-sets. They are extremely well developed and have some cliched yet awesome and intriguing personalities. Just so fun to watch them talk and interact with the environment around them. And that makes the casting not only Angelina, but everybody in the cast and directing chairs extremely well performed. But a bad script is a bad script. The only thing about the directing I think could have been improved would be to step in and add a little more of the good stuff. The director has a lot of experience but not in the greatest stuff, so I think some constructive criticism could be useful.<br /><br />Salt was very good, but it needed pepper. But again, the real reason to see this movie is the characters, I think if we buy a ticket to support anybody, it would be to support the actors. What a fantastic cast. But I don't think I'll buy it on Blu-Ray/DVD.<br /><br />Well, for the characters alone I would rate it 4.5, but because of it's faults, it draws it down ALL THE WAY to 3.4/5<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman signing off.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>....but,but jolie is in it !!!! shes hot so the movie has to be great. right ?!?!?!?<br /><br />this might have been an alright waste of time in the vain of RED, The Expendables, From Paris With Love and any jason statham movie if it hadnt taken itself seriously. its highly unbelievable, poorly acted, had zero humor (implied or intended), those behind the scenes didnt fair any better.<br /><br />from what i remember;<br />shes a spy, but isnt on the side she thinks she on or should be on. this takes the premise from ''last kiss goodbye'' a little further. the action sequences were lame, there was no tension or intruige. the plot, again, was laughable. if this didnt have jolie in it, it would not be getting attention or ratings above 2 stars.<br /><br />easily forgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>(1.)

It seemed like it was going to go in the direction of Dark Angel, but then the movie goes somewhere else.  Then maybe like Alias with some hot butt kicking.  Nope!  She was just focused on spider boy... I guess spider boy was suppose to be her assignment???  I just kept waiting for it to get better.  Just when I thought it was going to get good, they movie goes into a different direction.  It was a flop.  Great actors with bad scenes and difficult to follow.  This movie was constantly getting off track.  And that ending... what was that?  What a waist.  Don't do a sequel Angelina.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>One thing you can count on: When Angelina Jolie does an action movie, you know you're going to get action and plenty of it.  The action in "Salt" is so non-stop, so relentless, so slam-bang-in-your-face, that the film moves at warp speed and it's over almost before you realize it.  That the plot is patently ridiculous somehow doesn't seem to matter very much.  This movie is meant to be pure fun, and on that score, it delivers.<br /><br />Jolie plays Evelyn Salt (it's interesting that this role was originally written for a male actor, but Jolie proves she is more than able to handle it), a CIA operative married to a German scientist who specializes in all kinds of deadly spiders, who managed to get her out of a North Korean prison where she is being gruesomely tortured as the film opens.  But it turns out she may or may not be a Russian sleeper agent who is scheduled to go into action as soon as some very nasty stuff hits the fan; specifically, the assassinations of both the Russian and American presidents, and the detonation of a nuclear bomb or two.<br /><br />Salt's cover is blown (maybe) and she protests she was set up, but since nobody believes her, she's off and running in some really exciting chase sequences.  Jolie actually did some of her own stunts in this movie, although not the more dangerous ones such as jumping from the top of one speeding truck to another.  The real fun in this film comes from the fact that we can't really tell who Salt is.  Is she an American agent, or Russian, or Russian pretending to be American, or American pretending to be Russian?  By the end of the film we still don't know, but we know one thing: the way this film ends, a sequel is probably already on the storyboards.<br /><br />All of the actors give creditable performances, but Jolie's performance is what really makes you want to see this film more than once.  Tabloid gossip aside, she's a damn good actress, and she totally throws herself into this movie, literally and figuratively.  Tune in next summer (hopefully) for the next exciting episode.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/4/11:<br /><br />I just watched the DVD with all three versions of the film (theatrical release, director's cut and extended cut), and am wondering why in the world didn't the studio release the extended cut in the theaters?  It's a totally different ending, which I'm darned if I'm giving away, except to say that it's much more satisfying and makes for a vastly better movie overall.<br /><br />You can choose your version simply by going to the DVD menu, click on Play Movie, and then select whichever of the three you want.  The extended cut of this movie is the one to watch.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I saw the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut of SALT with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />Review Of SALT-Theatrical Cut<br /><br />The theatrical version of SALT is very good. Engaging from beginning to end. Angelina Jolie is as good here as she was in the TOMB RAIDER movies, which is very impressive. There's plenty of suspense and twists & turns. The ending will shock you. Sort of like a female version of MINORITY REPORT, starring Tom Cruise, who was originally attatched to star, but he withdrew saying that his the character was too much like Ethan Hunt from the MISSION: Impossible movies, and he was right. But Ms. Jolie manages to make the character her very own. Well-written script. Had I written it, though, I would have deleted the misuse of God's name (ie. God followed by a mild profanity), as I feel it is blasphemous. Plenty of action and suspense. I recommend it. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG. A sequel looks like F-U-N.<br /><br />Review Of SALT- Director's Cut<br /><br />The Director's Cut of SALT is a bit longer than the theatrical cut, with some additional flashback sequences cut from the Theatrical Version, some more violence, and an entirely different end for the President and Michael. Good fun, though I think that the added voiceover at the end implying Salt's death could just be a cover for a possible sequel. I prefer the open ending of the theatrical version. But see which version you like better. Unfortunately, the profaning of God's name is still present.<br /><br />Both versions of the film are rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I liked it I thought it had good action and the plot isn't bad. I enjoyed it and like seeing Jolie in action movies, I did thought though that in this movie Salt most of the stunts are like Jolie's movie "Wanted".<br /><br />Towards the end love the twist was surely not expecting that.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>As the advertisement asks, "A you (firt name) Salt? Yes. Then you are a russian spy." There is a person saying that Jolie is working for another country, Jolie saying she has to make sure her loved ones are safe, and the world seeing chasing after her. As the plots begin to spin, you begin to wonder if anyone is who they say they are and who, exactly, Salt is. she is ruthless, that's for sure, and she knows her stuff. Still, she is an agent with a past and that past is something that mingles with some high profile people.<br /><br />Salt is one of those movies that hits the ground running and waits for you to catch up. For an adrenile movie it has something of a complex plot (meaning it is complex on a Hollywood standard but a C- when looked out outisde of action), and i think this helps it. In the beginning you actually see how hard things are for an agent, see how complex it is when you work as a supposed spy, and then have that bubble deflated for you. you also have love added into the equation, making things interesting.<br /><br />When you look at this movie, a lot of it does revolve around the notion of love. From the start this is explain and given as part of the character, and from that start you gage what is transpiring. I have to hand it to jolie on this job because she seems to hold her own on all fields and she does it with style and a bit of mystery to her. Considering her real life and the microscope she operates under, you can see just how well this is portrayed there.<br /><br />The action here is fast, is solid, and the ideas are good. The movie is a run, Lola, run movie with a lot of firepower, and there are positions of the plot map that make you say "cool." I like the way some things happen and the way Salt stays ahead, but the movie doesn't make her chasing people's total fools. They are not far behind and she seems ready, but a plot portion of the movie and the past explains this. And, again, you cannot for the love piece.<br /><br />As much as this is the same movie in some ways, it differs in some good ways as well. The way jolie gets to do things, interesting things, to get out is interesting to me as well. I liked the fact that we do not see bullets into a wall as some means to get out or shooting hundreds of people. We are also not given watered down ideas but have enough of a plot to work on today's terror system. Combine that with the man in her life and I took interest, sadness, love, revenge, and so much more out of moments here. It was a nice 5, provided you know what you are into here.<br /><br />Thank you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Guided by Phillip Noyce's masterful direction, "Salt" (2010) provides a memorable action vehicle for Angelina Jolie. This preposterously entertaining spy thriller moves at a fast clip with plenty of dynamic set-pieces and plot twists. Liev Schreiber effectively underplays his role as a pursuing CIA agent - an ideal counterpoint to Jolie's vigorous presence. Far superior to the recent Bond and Bourne entries, with a "Salt" sequel already in the works.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>There are two ways to look at this movie;<br /><br />1) Taken as a serious film, it's ridiculously<br />  stupid. I mean this movie is aimed at the<br />  lowest common denominator. It' so<br />  unbelievable that it's practially a live<br />  action cartoon. Other than the Jolie<br />  character, the other characters are idiotic,<br />  especially the Liev Schrieber one.<br /><br />2) Viewed as a "guilty pleasure", this is a fun<br />  piece of mondo trash. Angelina Jolie is<br />  super sexy, makes as good as a heroine as<br />  any, the action sequences are thrilling and<br />  the plot turns are akin to pro wrestling.<br /><br />I do not condone the use of controlled substances but this is essentially "pot"/drunkard  entertainment. It's the type of movie where , if you just catch snippets, it's good enough. This is not a movie that you need to view from start to finish.<br /><br />If there would have been some choice nudity, then it really would have upped the trash-o-meter a la "Showgirls"</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Angelina Jolie plays the lead character in "Salt" ss a steroidal-driven CIA agent that mimics a Russian double agent intent on starting World War III. It takes a while to figure this out and you get to see Angelina go through scores of physical gyrations and stunts unlike anything her other cartoon character, Laura Kroft, ever achieved. For instance, at various times in this chase-filled film, Jolie:<br /><br />-- Scales skinny window sills of a high rise D.C. apartment building with her dog in the backpack -- in her bare feet.<br />-- Escapes capture by jumping from a freeway overpass onto a semi truck moving at freeway speed.<br />-- Jumps from that semi to a similarly haulin' gasoline tanker with a skinny grated deck.<br />-- Jumps to another vehicle moving at highway speed and hangs onto the edge by one hand before righting herself.<br /><br />All this without a scratch or without mussing her makeup or hair. Later on:<br /><br />-- She takes on at least 50 CIA agents in several combat scenes, without nary a scratch.<br />-- In purusit of the U.S. president, she repeatedly jumps downward in an elevator shaft, 3-4 floors at a time, always landing perfectly on little triangular steel ledges.<br />-- She survives and walks away from a car crash when the vehicle goes off the edge of a freeway, plummets 20-30 feet, and lands atop a bunch of other vehicles.<br /><br />She walks away from all this without a scratch. Oh yes, one time she cut herself. Later on, she destroys the funeral of the vice-president to the chagrin of 500 security agents and, to top that, saves the world from nuclear annihilation. If none of this is enough for you, in the final scene she takes a dive from a moving helicopter into a freezing ocean without a parachute or even her shirt, makes it to shore, then runs off into a fade to black screen, apparently setting the scene for "Salt II: The Return of Wonder Woman."<br /><br />To say this film defeats the concept of suspended disbelief is like saying the Hindenburg had a little accident. Whatever the merits of the film's story, acting, scenery and script, nothing can overcome its excessive, ridiculous and utterly laughable action sequences. No one can possibly believe, for one moment, that anything in this very high budget film could ever really have taken place.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>When a story is written about a double agent, a mole or a sleeper agent, any number of cards can play. As a result, the suspence and tension levels immediately go up qute a few notches.<br /><br />This movie is about Evelyn Salt (Jolie); and to a much lesser extent her husband, who is German and studies spiders.<br /><br />The story starts 2 years ago in Korea where Salt is being tortured, from there it is fast forwarded to where she meets a soviet agent, who is trying to activate her.<br /><br />Apparently, Salt's father was a powerful wrestler and her mother a chessmaster. Hence she has inherited her fighting skills and strategic capabilities from them.<br /><br />In this film, Salt is more resourceful than MacGyver, can escape lockdowns better than David Copperfield and can jump moving vehicles better than Morpheus (in Matrix 2). That being said, you can expect to be treated to a lot of high speed chases, gut wrenching escapes, and several tight plot twists.<br /><br />This film is guaranteed to have you riveted to your seat from start to finish. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Salt is not what you would call a masterpiece, or even on the same level as the similar Bourne films, but thanks to Angelina Jolie, it's just entertaining enough. She carries this movie on her skinny shoulders. What's up with her lack of weight? She looked great back in the Tomb Raider days, now she looks like a twig. I guess she's still a little sexy, but that's mainly due to her on-screen presence and butt kicking attitude. She and Milla Jovovich don't really look the part at first glance, but both have become the two main female action stars on the planet. The only difference being that Jolie has a much wider range with her acting talent.<br /><br />The plot and writing are decent, but the whole Russia vs. the U.S. thing has been old for decades. There are a couple of neat twists along the way and early on you're not quite sure if Jolie's character is good or bad, so that keeps things interesting. I thought the storyline with her husband needed to be expanded upon, especially since his character is vital in changing the mindset of an important individual. The action scenes are well shot and violent for PG-13, with Jolie taking out countless armed guards with ease. Her acting ability and body control makes it all the more believable. You also get a lot of real stunts and very little CGI, which is always welcomed.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor (dude needs a harder name to pronounce) are the only other main characters. They are both okay, but only a certain one gets to shine a bit more towards the end.<br /><br />Salt leaves room for a sequel or two. I read that this movie was originally written for Tom Cruise, so with the writing geared toward Angelina Jolie in future installments, I think they can be even better.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>what a movie.  this gots to  be one of Angelina's best movies.  in this movie she plays as a Russian spy playing as an American spy.  super cool lady.  with this blu-ray you get two versions of the movie.  unrated and theatrical.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Who would have ever though 12 years ago that perhaps the best action stars of their generation would be Matt Damon and Angelina Jolle?  Salt essentially is a "Bourne" movie with a female lead.  Evelyn Salt can kick ass as well as anyone and that is pretty much what she does.  The film doesn't promise to be a thinking man's (or woman's) story and has no pretenses.  It is, however a really well done action movie with a star that proves that her stunt work is as good as her acting and her looks.  Packaged up with some standout support from Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor this is how action movies should be made.  Granted, the plot is pretty ridiculous and I was able to figure out the ultimate twist early on.  Still I liked it very much.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer approaches some of the best quality that can be seen.  Likewise for the DTS-HD Master Audio.  There are several opportunities to show off a good system with a 360 degree soundfield.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>I hope that a decision is made to make a Salt II film continuing the superb suspense and action contained in this movie; it is that good. Angelina Jolie, known as Evelyn Salt in the film, is freed from a North Korean prison after being continually tortured in the prison while the North Korean soldiers try unsuccesfully to get her to admit that she is an American spy. When she is released, we are told that she has been working as a top agent for the CIA. We are also told that had a certain man not caused a lot of publicity about her capture, the CIA would not have tried to get her released. She hears this from her CIA boss.<br /><br />Two years later, when she is married to the man who helped get her released, a top Russian agent comes to the CIA claiming that he wants to defect. He reveals that Russians want to kill the Russian president while he is visiting the US and participating in the funeral service for the American Vice President. He says that Salt is the Russian agent assigned to do the murder. Government agents try to arrest her, but she escapes. We begin to see that she has many skills. She tries to locate her husband who does not answer any of her calls. We see a long and exciting chase by government agents after Salt.<br /><br />The film raises the questions: What happened to Salt's husband? Is the defector telling the truth? If yes, how did she become a Russian agent? If not, what is going on? Will the Russian president be shot and, if so, by whom? Why did the defector identify her as the murderer?</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>One of the best American action films in quite a while. The action is fast and gritty. The stunts seldom blow past the limits of near-credibility into the realm of CGI cartoon as so many films do these days. The action careens along at such a clip and the plot is just twisty enough that you can't always see what's coming. Man, I wish Jolie weren't too big a name and too expensive to have joined the Avengers ensemble as Black Widow. She would have been spot-on perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>In this spy thriller, Angelina Jolie is a star.  She is transforming her looks from blonde to black, long hair to short hair, female to male gender.  Her attire goes from business sexy to matrix-like sexy.  As in "Lara Croft" movie this heroine is smart, determined, beautiful and she can fight, pull some serious stunts by riding on the top of the truck, or riding a motorcycle bike. Oh, and this time around, the heroine speaks Russian!<br /><br />This is an action packed movie that will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  However, I found some of the scenes difficult to watch, especially the ones where Jolie's heroine gets punched around by beefy male advesaries.  Good entertainment movie that leaves ending open to "Salt 2" sequel....</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>That isn't to say that I don't appreciate Jolie's talent or enjoy her in more serious fare, but there is something about Angelina that demands your attention, and that attention is never better arrested than when Angelina is drop kicking bad guys and jumping out of moving vehicles.<br /><br />Surround her with explosions and she shines!<br /><br />`Salt' is an interesting film.  On the outset it seems like a generic action adventure film with little merit outside of Jolie's commanding presence.  Instead, what one finds is a remarkably well rounded film that understands the importance of building a story instead of staging a series of random action sequences.  The story presented in `Salt' is an engaging and thought provoking one, and while it is obviously handled in a way that puts the emphasis on the explosions, it doesn't forsake `brains' in the process.<br /><br />`Salt' tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt.  Apparently she's a Russian spy.  This is news to her and soon she is on the run from her former friends and colleagues who want to detain her.  She seems to be mainly concerned for her husband's wellbeing, and of course clearing her name.<br /><br />Twists, turns and a lot of `booms' ensue.<br /><br />The action is top notch here, wonderfully paced to implode in the eardrums and eye sockets of the movie-watching public; and it works great.  Angelina kicks serious booty, and the slick editing makes for a thrilling ride.  I will call caution to the film's constant violent nature.  To be honest, there are many sequences that feel almost too graphic for the film's rating.  I'm shocked that it didn't receive an R rating (that stairway execution scene in particular was very rough).  So, be mindful of the kiddies.  The acting is all what you'd expect from a film in this genre.  I want to say that I really love Liev Schreiber and really wish he'd get better roles.  He has such acting talent (I still cry when I think of his performance in `A Walk on the Moon') but he never gets to really use it.  It appears that he has Peter Sarsgaard syndrome (great actor reduced to stereotypical villain roles).<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD, GIVE THESE MEN BETTER ROLES!!!<br /><br />Alas, there is no real reason to gripe about that here, since the film is elevated with his presence, and I'm happy about that.  In the end I totally recommend this.  It's loud, abrasive and IN-YOUR-FACE, but it has depth of story that is not often found within this genre.<br /><br />Stand up job, if I do say so myself.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>It seems Hollywood will take any excuse to get Angelina Jolie running around with a gun and makeup. The plot of this movie is laughably bad. It revives Cold War fears of Russian sleeper agents, except Jolie's character Salt can take on squads of Americans without getting a scratch. The movie does a good job at keeping the audience guessing, to the point where I was even surprised by one or two of the plot twists. But overall it's fairly predictable and silly. I'd give it 2 stars, plus an additional star for managing to make Angelina Jolie look hot as both a blonde and brunette.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I knew this movie was Angelina Jolie doing the James Bond thing...sort of.<br />When I popped the DVD in it gave me three options.<br />"Theatrical Version"<br />"Director's Cut"<br />And the version I ended up watching "Extended Cut".<br /><br />Jolie turns in a great performance along with the rest of the cast.<br />Solid direction.<br />A decent score.<br />Pacing was spot on.<br />The only thing I found a little disappointing as I do with all films like this is how unrealistic it is.<br />Jolie and crew simply walk away from accidents and falls that would kill anyone without so much as a scratch and not a hair out of place.<br /><br />That minor gripe aside, the film is a blast.<br />Great popcorn movie that doesn't require a lot of thought.<br />I give it my recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>(Unrated version) WARNING: This review may contain unintentional plot spoilers. The movie had me hooked about 20 minutes into it. Angelina Jolie spends 2 years in a N.Korean prison out of the reach of Jimmy Carter. She is released in a spy swap. She works for a dummy CIA company in New York which doesn't have a metal detector sophisticated enough to detect knife blades inside of shoes. After Jolie is back in NYC, a Russian defector comes in from the cold and tells us, and the CIA, the plot of the movie. He claims Angelina (Salt) is really a Russian mole, planted here as a child and she is going to kill the Russian president. Salt denies this, and runs away before she could clear herself in order to save her husband. There are numerous minor flashbacks during the movie to fill in plot points. They also make the predictable "twists" predictable enough for dummies.<br /><br />The film makes fun of the real Angelina who can't cook, but can do everything else. She can make a better cannon than William Shatner out of household items. Bobby Clark (Gorn)in a rubber mask would not have stood a chance. She can scale a building in her bare feet and split skirt better than Spider Man (or Spider Babe for Misty Mundae fans). Salt can also jump from the top of truck to truck, better than Tom Cruise and that is after taking a bullet to the hip, which doesn't even give her a limp. Jolie can ride a motorcycle as well as Evel Knievel and can beat up men quicker than Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. I am not sure why the NYPD handcuffed people with their hands in the front. I guess the "behind the back" cuff would have made the escape too unbelievable. And Bruce Willis could have taken notes on how to climb down an elevator shaft from Salt.<br /><br />And during the whole time, her makeup never ran or hair came out of place. Okay, we'll forgive you about not being able to cook.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Director Philip Noyce and star Angelina Jolie, the pair who gave us a thriller "The Bone Collector" back in 1999, team up again for "Salt," action thriller about Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent on the run, accused of being a Russian spy. To make my review short and not to spoil anything about the film, I can only say is that the fast-paced and action-packed thriller, penned by Kurt Wimmer ("The Recruit"), keeps you guessing until the end, though you may notice lots of plot holes when you leave the theater, or even before.<br /><br />This is not to say the film is bad. "Salt" delivers goods with Angelina Jolie as the titular character, who remains a mystery from the very start (the film begins with a sequence set in North Korea, slightly reminiscent of one James Bond film). In fact some parts of the film remind us of James Bond or Jason Bourne films, but Jolie lends energy (if not credibility) to the convoluted storyline, which looks sometimes dated with the heroine's back story and these inevitable "villains." Or maybe we should call it old-fashioned.<br /><br />"Salt" is mindless fun with lots of actions. The action set-pieces including chases and shoot-outs are all well-done though some of them stretch credibility to the point where Salt looks almost superhuman (never afraid of ricocheting bullets). But Bond and Bourne are also superhuman, so why not Evelyn Salt?</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Salt (action, crime, mystery)<br />Directed by Phillip Noyce<br />Starring Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor<br /><br />Sony Pictures | 2010 | 101 min | Unrated | Released Dec 21, 2010<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />French: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />BD-Live<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />Salt is full of action and includes an air of mystery. The opening scene takes us back two years and we see Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogated in North Korea. She's in pretty bad shape after being beaten, but refuses to talk, even when a tube is forced down her throat and gasoline is poured in. She's eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange and returns to work as a CIA agent. This all happens at the start of the movie and sets up what is to come.<br /><br />The final thing I'm going to reveal is an encounter with a Russian defector. She's selected to interview him and discovers that there's a plan underway to substitute certain Americans with Russians. They become sleepers who will eventually act on behalf of Russia. He informs any agents who might be listening that Evelyn Salt is the name of one such agent.<br /><br />Salt has a decision to make. Which of her colleagues can she trust? Should she stay and answer the accusations? Would it be better to run and try to prevent other sleeper agents from fulfilling their purpose? She decides to run and most of her colleagues see it as an admission of guilt. We're placed in her position and it's one with no obvious solutions. It has the same feel as the Bourne movies, with confusion surrounding her identity.<br /><br />The CIA isn't happy that she evaded capture and sends agents to bring her back. This results in a huge chase scene in which Salt makes some unlikely decisions. If you're a fan of action movies, this is where the story really takes off. The first chase scene happens on a highway and sees Salt making improbable leaps between moving vehicles to evade capture.<br /><br />Jolie looks capable of making some of the jumps, and we see her continually revise her plan as she flees her pursuers. The story keeps us guessing about the level of her involvement and we can't be sure what her motivations are. She's resourceful and uses her intelligence in order to predict the moves of her pursuers and discover the motivations of the Russian group.<br /><br />If you enjoy movies such as Taken, Wanted, Bourne or Die Hard, this is your kind of story. The first adrenalin rush comes early and we rarely have time to breathe. There is a plot, although it's secondary to the action. This is a movie that entertains because of its pacing and spectacular chase scenes. There's not a great deal of thought required, but you will see that everything makes some kind of sense if you think about what you have just seen. Well, it makes as much sense as the average James Bond movie.<br /><br />If you want to see Jolie running around, climbing, jumping and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, grab your popcorn and enjoy the ride. The loose ends are tied up neatly and the conclusion is satisfying. The acting is convincing, although Jolie never has to show the range of emotion that she achieved in Changeling. Schreiber and Ejiofor are always good and both play their roles well.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />It's hard to fault the look of the movie. Colors appear natural and detail is strong. There's a fine layer of grain and the picture has considerable pop. I felt like I was in the middle of the action. Sony has delivered another great transfer.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />There's a lot happening on the screen and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track handles everything that's thrown at it. Chase scenes sound incredible, while scenes involving explosions and gunfire have the appropriate impact. Dialogue doesn't suffer either, and the surrounds are active throughout the duration of the movie. The score adds to the action scenes and completes the experience. You won't have any complaints about the presentation.<br /><br />Special Features 4.5/5<br /><br />The additional features all appear in full HD.<br /><br />Spy Cam: Picture-in-Picture - The movie includes three cuts and this feature is only available on the theatrical version.<br /><br />Filmmakers' Commentary<br /><br />The Ultimate Female Action Hero (8:05) - Showing some of the stunts that Jolie performed.<br /><br />The Real Agents (12:33) - Former spies talk about their experiences.<br /><br />Spy Disguise: The Looks of Evelyn Salt (5:26) - A look at the various appearances Jolie used in the movie.<br /><br />The Modern Master of the Political Thriller: Phillip Noyce (9:15) - Noyce explains why he has good insight into the life of a spy, and describes how he tries to capture the attention of the audience.<br /><br />Salt: Declassified (29:47) - A thorough "making of" feature that goes into more depth about some of the things covered in the other features.<br /><br />"The Treatment" Radio Interview with Phillip Noyce (27:12) - Elvis Mitchell interviews Noyce.<br /><br />Previews<br /><br />BD-Live<br /><br />Salt is a well-crafted spy movie that's heavy on the action, although there are a couple of twists in there too. Jolie looks the part and is convincing in her role and the supporting cast does a great job. If you want to be thrilled for 100 minutes without having to think too much, this will get the job done. The Blu-ray presentation is excellent and the special features contain a wealth of additional information if you're curious.<br /><br />Overall Score 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>"Salt" is named after the character played in this film by Angelina Jolie.  It is not too much to say that this film appears to have been essentially designed to showcase Jolie's great looks and ability to carry off a non-stop action film.  The action in this film starts early and never ends.  The action scenes are well-done and exciting.  Of course, the trade-off is that to a significant extent the action comes at the sacrifice of more plot and character development.<br /><br />All that having been said, this film does have an interesting storyline; something of a "Charm School" theme for my fellow Nelso DeMille fans.  Without giving much of anything away (very minor spoiler) the plot here is that the Cold War Soviets have infiltrated the USA with Russian sleeper agents who were trained from childhood to pass as Americans.  Needless to say they are up to no good.  And therein lies the basic story of this film.<br /><br />My whole family enjoyed watching "Salt" and it is certainly good enough, and nuanced enough, to justify watching more than once.  Recommended.  RJB.</p></br></body></html>

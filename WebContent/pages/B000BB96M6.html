Their chocolates were amazing.  Seemed like Wonka could invent candy other folks just dreamed of making---like ice cream that never melted even on the hottest day.  So amazing, in fact, that a good many of the employees performed industrial espionage.  Soon, Wonka's competitors were offering no-melt ice cream and gum that didn't lose its flavor.<br /><br />Willy could have no idea that at least one or two of his competitors could steal in no time flat.<br /><br />Sadly, Willy Wonka closed the door on the factory and let all his employees go.  No one's been in there since, but the choclate keeps pouring out.<br /><br />In an unprecedented move, Willy offers five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars.  The children who win these five tickets get to visit the chocolate factory for a day--and one will come away with an unheard of prize:  which Willy will not list!<br /><br />Charlie badly wants to win the prize, both for himself and his grandfather.  But, how does poor Charlie stand a chance if he only gets one bar of chocolate per year---on his birthday.<br /><br />Meanwhile, kids are finding the Golden Tickets.  First, there's a fat German kid who eats chocolate all the time.  Then, there's a spoilt British girl whose industrialist father buys her hundreds of thousands of chocolate bars just so she can get the one.  Then, a kid hacker from Colorado who pegs the system and knows just which bar to buy.  Finally, the world's champion gum chewer and her stage mom win.<br /><br />They're down to one.  Charlie finds a dollar in the snow and gets the last ticket.<br /><br />The next day is the tour of the chocolate factory.  Wonka, the five kids and their respective parents go on an amazing tour where they discover that a tiny race of people--the oompah loompahs--are who now work at the factory creating choclates.  Throughout the tour, each of the children is tested---til only one remains.<br /><br />The effects in this film are pretty amazing.  I will admit I wasn't certain Depp could pull the role off, but he did.  He's a somewhat more disociated Wonka than Gene Wilder, but still interesting.  Overall, a very enjoyable film and a sweet deal for both the young and the young at heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I'll preface my review by stating that I'm a huge fan of Gene Wilder's, but his version of Willy Wonka was not as dark as Roald Dahl wrote him to be. Still, Wilder dominated his film. In the newer version Depp is a somewhat demented, socially, and emotionally retarded Peter Pan. That said, his performance is brilliant, as is Freddie Highmore's. Deep Roy is also excellent as the entire band of Oompa Loompas, but the real stars of this beautifully rendered fairy tale are Tim Burton, and Danny Elfman. The cinematography, attention to detail, painterly use of color, and surreal flavor of the sets go way beyond the earlier screen version, and the somewhat dark twist to this classic aligns it more to something from the Brothers Grimm than the older, sugar-coated ( no pun intended, of course... ) WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCALATE FACTORY film. Elfman's music, as usual, not only paces the story, but helps to tell it as well. Scrumptuous- from beginning to end. It might be a bit scary for very young children, however.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I am a huge fan of the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder, so I was skeptical about this 2005 remake.  While Burton's film doesn't match the brilliance of Stuart's classic it does have its moments and there are many redeeming qualities.  It does differ drastically from the `71 film, which is probably a good thing in that it can't find itself chastised too much for failing to live up, for in the end it views like a completely different movie.  Both films were based on Roald Dahl's book, although it was made clear that Dahl disapproved of the `71 film.<br /><br />The basis or foundation of this film is the same as the previous.  A young poor boy finds a golden ticket that gives him the chance to tour the Chocolate Factory of one Willy Wonka.  He's accompanied by his grandfather as well as four other children and their parents, all of which have some very undesirable personality traits.  Their `flaws' so-to-speak end up costing them a great deal in the long run as they make their way through the wacky and crazy factory.<br /><br />`Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is considerably lighter fare than `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. This has a lot to do with the difference in approach that both Depp and Wilder took to the character of Willy Wonka.  Depp is much more comical and slapstick than Wilder was.  I much prefer Wilder's performance for he added layers of darkness and I think in the end it was his performance that elevated the true morale that this story sets out to embrace.  Depp, looking scarily like Michael Jackson (don't even begin to try and say that he wasn't an inspiration), is hilarious and he proves yet again he is a true chameleon, but I just don't think that his performance is as iconic as Wilder's.<br /><br />What was a nice improvement were the performances given by the child actors here.  All five of them really shine.  We all know that young Freddie Highmore can act; just watch his marvelous performance in `Finding Neverland' (can you say OSCAR SNUB).  Here he is charming and sweet.  AnnaSophia Robb, dubbed the next Dakota Fanning, delivers a very strong performance that sets her apart as `best in show' in my opinion as far as the child actors go.  Julia Winter is also on point and convincing.  Jordan Fry is supremely obnoxious, truly commanding and while Philip Wiegratz isn't really given much to work with, he works well with it.  The parts of the parents are also played well.  Missi Pyle (hilarious), James Fox, Adam Godley and Franziska Troegner are all decent here.  David Kelly is good as Grandpa Joe, although I just loved Jack Albertson's performance.  I wish that Helena Bonham Carter would have had a heftier role, but just looking at her is enough for me sometimes.<br /><br />What can't be denied is the fact that Tim Burton's imagination is boundless.  Visually `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is flawless.  Everything is lush and rich.  That is the biggest draw to this remake; it is a visual masterpiece.  The sets, the costumes, the candy; it is all marvelously created and embellished.  It reminds me in parts of what `Alice in Wonderland' would look like brought to the big screen once again (let's pitch that idea to Tim Burton...with maybe AnnaSophia Robb as Alice...).<br /><br />The biggest drawback to `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' though is the horrendous new songs and musical numbers.  What I found so irritating is the fact that you can't understand a single word Deep Roy is uttering.  I loved the original songs.  I was depressed they had changed them.  They were messy and sloppy and horrendous.<br /><br />In the end I think that `Charlie and Chocolate Factory' may delight more children then the original film did.  This is much lighter and more campy that the Stuart masterpiece.  While Stuart's vision I feel was much more mature and controversial and in the end elicits much more conversation I feel that Burton and Depp understood their audience here and created an above-average family film that is delightful to say the least.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In Hollywood, repeat collaborations between certain actors and directors is a very popular, and generally lucrative prospect for all parties involved. Each partner in the collaboration walks away a winner, mostly because the movie that was worked on was a success, earning them more respect, bigger star power, and sometimes even critical acclaim. There are currently a few big name collaborations that have been prominent over the last few years, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh ("Ocean's 11-13"), Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan ("Batman Begins" and "The Prestige"), Kevin Smith and the batch of actors that have appeared in almost every one of his films (from "Mallrats" to "Clerks 2"). But there is one collaboration that has existed longer than the others, since the 1990 release of "Edward Scissorhands", the collaborators are, of course, Johnny Depp ('Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy) and director Tim Burton ("Batman"). What's impressive about this particular collaboration, sure the length of time is quite a feat by Hollywood standards, but the fact that this collaboration remains so powerful at the box office is astonishing. Almost every one of Johhny Depp's and Tim Burton's movies have turned a profit. In 2007, the duo came together yet again for the movie "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street", but before this film the two worked on the remake of the Roald Dahl children's classic "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", the novel that had been previously adapted in 1971 with "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".<br /><br />"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is the story of a sweet, good-hearted little boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who lives in a rundown shack with his mother, father, and both sets of grandparents. They have next to nothing to live on, and Charlie's birthday is coming up, and the only thing they can afford is one single candy bar. But not just any candy bar, a Wonka Bar, made at the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory located in the same town. What makes the factory so mysterious is that not a single person has been seen coming or going from that factory in 15 years, that is until an announcement goes out to the whole world that 5 lucky people will be selected to visit the factory and meet the reclusive owner, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). Most of Charlie's life, good fortune has been rather elusive, but one lucky day changes everything as Charlie finds one of the 5 golden tickets that will give him access to Wonka's factory, and the wonders that Charlie will behold will change his life forever.<br /><br />When I first heard about this movie's release, I wasn't all that excited to see it, in fact I didn't even want to see it at all. For starters, I didn't care a whole lot for the original movie "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" starring Gene Wilder, so I didn't really see what I would find of interest here. Plus, the original film was so well received by critics and audiences, that I didn't understand the point behind making this updated version. However, one day I recorded the movie off of the Showtime network, and figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I mean, it's Johnny Depp and Tim Burton together again, just how bad could this movie be.<br /><br />Truth be told, the movie's not all that bad. It's obvious the reason that Depp and Burton continue collaborating is that there is a chemistry there that allows their work together to be so successful, and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was at least a decent addition to their list of collaborations, though not their best by any means.<br /><br />As one could easily tell from the previews, and possibly the DVD cover for that matter, the movie is strange, no doubt about that. There's a lot of weird things that occur in the movie, some that happened in the original, and some new, but the story is actually quite endearing as you watch this young boy's innocence begins to reach this reclusive man, showing him that reaching out and trusting in others will bring a sense of belonging into his life. There were some elements to the film that I didn't care for, primarily the song numbers, they were just flat-out irritating to listen to, and I found myself skipping ahead to the end of the song as they did nothing more than slow the movie down. Some of the characters were extremely annoying, but that's not so much the actors fault as it was simply the way the character was meant to be, but I still didn't care for them and couldn't wait for them to get off the screen.<br /><br />Performance wise, Johnny Depp did an excellent job as the quirky eccentric Willy Wonka, a role I was surprised that Depp was chosen for, but his chameleon-like ways with characters continued to serve him well in this movie. Some critics of the film felt Depp's portrayal was a bit too much like Michael Jackson, leaving them with a creepy feeling when Wonka was on screen. Personally I didn't read that into his Depp's performance, though I can maybe see how some might think that. The other standout performance was Freddie Highmore's, this talented young actor, who previously appeared in "Finding Neverland" with Johnny Depp, convincingly conveyed the innocence and naive view of the world that Charlie possessed, and he seemed like the perfect good kid, to the point he was a little unbelievable as a character. Charlie's character, in this film, was just too perfect, he listened and obeyed everything that Wonka requested, yet in the original, if I remember correctly both he and his grandpa snuck away to mess around in some bubble room that caused them to fly for a little bit. To me this change came off a little too much like director Tim Burton was trying too hard to make Charlie seem so good compared to the other kids, so he changed the story to make Charlie seem perfect. Now I will say that I've never read the book, and I've heard that the original film changed numerous elements from the book, so maybe the reason Burton's version didn't have the scene was because the book didn't, so I don't know, maybe Burton got it right in the end, either way I would have preferred a little more complexity to Charlie to make his character a little more believable.<br /><br />The sets for this movie were all intricately detailed, from Charlie's family shack that was designed to be leaning as if it could fall over at any time, further illustrating the family's poor lot in life. To the extravagance of Wonka's factory, where each room was visually amazing, without feeling faked by CGI. Director Tim Burton's eye for the unusual and keen attention to detail was evident in his sets, and his strong imagination and storytelling ability was perfect for a movie such as this.<br /><br />Even with good performances, extravagant set pieces, and imaginative storytelling by director Tim Burton, this movie is still only average in my opinion. The parts I liked were entertaining, and the parts I didn't weren't that major, but as a whole the movie just didn't grab me to the point that I felt like it was a great movie. I thought it was good to see once, but I probably would not choose to watch it again.<br /><br />"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is rated PG for mild language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>The involvement of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, along with the need to see another treatment of Roald Dahl's classic children's book got me interested in this film. We have the '70s musical version with Gene Wilder on VHS. It was OK but didn't quite capture Dahl's magic.<br /><br />This version was less a traditional musical as all the numbers featured the Oompa-Loompas and were takeoffs on big production numbers from other movie musicals. I guess as much could be expected from Danny Elfman, who has done the music for The Simpsons and other Burton movies (including the amazing "The Nightmare Before Christmas"). Elfman also does all the Oompa-Loompa singing vocals.<br /><br />Burton brings a back story to the Oompa-Loompas and to Willie Wonka, while Depp bring his own bizarre interpretation to the Wonka role. It's a good followup to his turn pirate Jack Sparrow in "Pirates of the Caribbea."<br /><br />The other four kids who find the Golden Tickets are right on the mark--gluttonous Gloop, greedy Veruca, vain Veronica, and smart-a** Mike--and all get their just desserts, so to speak. Special mention also go to Deep Roy (an Indian actor, I assume) who by the magic of digital technology, plays all the Oompa-Loompas, including the one who is Wonka's psychologist, and to the young actor who plays good-hearted Charlie of the title. Squirrels also play an important digitally-enhanced role.<br /><br />Overall, this movie might be a little strange (especially the squirrels) for very small children, but is good family fare with its own style.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>FIRST THOUGHTS:<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE THAT ADULTS WILL LIKE AS MUCH AS IT'S AN ADULT FILM THAT CHILDREN WILL BE CAPTIVATED BY<br /><br />I overcame my usual reluctance to see something new and bizare when I watched this DVD single disk edition over the past weekend with my 7 year old son. The result was simple: he loved it and demanded [reminiscent of some of the kids with gold tickets] that I replay many of the wild chocolate factory scenes -- over and over and I didn't mind doing it for him! The only other films that struck him in this way from first viewing were; "The Yellow Submarine", "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "Aladdin" and "The Wizard of Oz"! That puts Tim Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' in pretty good company I'd say.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>When I first heard that they were doing a remake I was totally shocked and worried. Gene Wilder did such a good job that I was reluctant to go see this one. But, as soon as I heard that Johnny Depp was playing Wonka and that Tim Burton was directing all my worries just dirfted away. What I like about this one is that it's not exactly the same as the original. After watching the other one a million times . . . I was expecting something different. The sets were real, people. No CGI there. The acting was hilarious and all the characters gave something different to the remake. But, however possible, in this one, Wonka slightly takes on a creepier tone. Gene wilder was playful, but in this one, Wonka almost has a glimmer of sadism in his eyes. Watch the Sqirrel scene, you'll see what I'm talking about. Anyhow, the misfortunes of the children were very funny and gave me back the memories from before. The only thing that I really didn't like were two very distinctive things:<br /><br />One, the oompa loompas were totally wrong. All of them looked depressed or just plain angry. Not like the orange-faced goof balls in the last one.<br /><br />Two, the songs were not as pleasing. They say that the songs were taken straight from the book. The whole movie, in fact is based soley on the book, give or take a few scenes, while the original was made with a genrally understanding of the book. But, all in all, the 1974 WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACOTRY still does better at the songs. That's my opinion. But the movie still is enjoyable.<br /><br />Final Verdict: The Shananigans are back.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>A wonderful expressionist realization of a story that, at bottom, is about the viciousness and wonder to which children are equally susceptible, and the culpability of parents in the failings of their children -- i.e. for the parents' failure to cultivate in their children a sense of wonder and a healthy respect for the unknown.  (That is why I think Burton's addition of the backstory regarding Wonka and his candy-hating dentist father is very much in the spirit of the original.)  The Dickensian world of Charlie is lovingly recreated by Burton, replete with a leaning shack and twisted doors that suggest the German expressionist techniques evident in the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  The Oompah Loompahs are perfect, and Tim Burton admirably avoids the racism implicit in the original story by making the Oompah Loompahs (all but a few, as far as I can tell, played by the same suave actor) without resorting to the campiness of the prior movie version, by making them much more clever than the rest of the characters in the story.  Their musical numbers had me and my children laughing out loud, especially where in the song for Mike Teavee they become a perfect parody of 70's glam rock (nearly besting even Spinal Tap in this brief number).  Tim Burton has his hits and misses, but this is definitely a big hit!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Director Tim Burton's macabre sense of humor meets writer Roald Dahl's macabre sense of humor in this adaptation of Dahl's novel "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". I hated the first cinematic incarnation of the novel, 1971's "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory", when I was a child, so I loaded this one into my DVD player with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised to be at least mildly engaged in the story and generally entertained, though I have the same qualms about showing "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" to young children that I did about the 1971 film. The film's sometimes sadistic humor may be genuinely disturbing to children, and the eccentric Willy Wonka is just plain creepy. I actually thought it was a horror film when I was a child.<br /><br />Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is an "ordinary little boy" who lives with his impoverished but loving family. One day, the reclusive candy magnate Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) announces that he will allow 5 children to tour his huge and mysterious factory, one of whom will win a grand prize "beyond your wildest imagination". Five Golden Tickets have been placed randomly in Wonka chocolate bars, and children all over the world vie to find them. Poor little Charlie has a wealth of luck and comes up with one of the tickets himself. He chooses his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) to accompany him on the tour, and off they go with four other children and their parents to see how Willy Wonka makes all that delicious candy.<br /><br />Johnny Depp can make creepy, antisocial characters interesting, and he brings a sense of innocence to Willy Wonka that helps. But to tell the truth, Willy Wonka is an unsettling guy who doesn't even like children. Worse, the fates that await the youngsters could easily be the stuff of nightmares -so be careful if you know your child is sensitive. The child actors do a great job of expressing their characters' over-the-top personalities. If the writing has any fault, it is that Charlie is a good boy but a bland character, while his more mischievous companions have stronger personalities and do more to entertain. Annasophia Robb is especially fun to watch as ultra-competitive Violet Beauregarde. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is obviously intended for children, hence the lessons on the value of family and consequences of disobedience...and the silly song and dance numbers. But the film is peppered with jokes and allusions aimed at adults. It's admirable that "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" strives to entertain its entire audience, but I wonder if the adults won't be just mildly entertained while the kids are just creeped out.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Time Burton does it again with his trademark gothic and bizarre movie backdrops. One cannot deny the dark imagery and the visual effects that make the film a Burton production -- the irony and the dysfunctions of his characters that are played out with each child and their relationship with their parents.  This is the core issue in the film as well as for Wonka's personality; Wonka cannot even say the word p-a-r-e-nt.  The landscape of the film almost depicts a time that has long passed -- the Cold War imagery of espionage, stealing the Wonka candy formula.  The film has traits from past Burton films, such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and BIG FISH as well as from other twisted fictitious narratives, LEMONY SNICKET, and forgive me, THE CAT IN THE HAT.  Johnny Depp presents a unique Willy Wonka with his somewhat androgynous appearance that has been suggestive as a cross between the "King of Pop" and Carol Channing. Burton follows the same plotline as the original CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY film, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and stays true to Roahl Dhal's novel as well as a few extras that explain Wonka's childhood.<br /><br />CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY by all means does not follow the musical giddiness of the original movie with memorable numbers, such as "The Candyman," "Pure Imagination," and "I've Got a Golden Ticket."  However, the Oompa loompa numbers somewhat fill the void, and proceeds the same as the WILLY WONKA film where each child is eliminated from the factory tour.  The most delicious scene throughout the film is the Wonka chocolate bar, and the river full of hot chocolate amidst the edible green hilly pastures with its cherry candy trees and puffy whipped cream -- how yummy.<br /><br />Overall, the film will indeed entertain and enchant each viewer.  It is appropriate for children eight years-old and older.  However, children under eight years-old should be accompanied with an adult because of particular situations and references that are mentioned in the film that they may not understand.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Being a HUGE fan of the 1971 film staring Gene Wilder, I had to wait a while and let the "hype" from this film's premiere settle down a bit before going and seeing it for myself. I heard some people hated it because it didn't "feel" like the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film they grew up with, while others applauded Tim Burton for making another unforgettable movie experience.<br /><br />Most of you reading this should (by now) know the story of Wonka: famous chocolatier closes his factory for many years because of competing chocolate makers stealing all his secrets. Then, suddenly, he decides to reopen the factory, but only to five children who find the five golden tickets hidden inside Wonka bars. The great puzzler that the world asks is "Why?" Why open up only to five kids and not the world? This is Willy Wonka's secret agenda and the climax to both the 1971 film and this 2005 "re-imagining".<br /><br />Hollywood is remaking EVERYTHING nowadays. I see this as a two-fold issue: #1 -- they seem to have run out of original story ideas (or at the very least have few left) so they're remaking what made money in the past; #2 -- they're trying (and successfully I might add) to tap into the X-Generations childhood love of certain films and bring them back to the big screen, thus pulling us (I'm an X-Gen, too) back into the movie theater to spend our hard-earned cash. I'm not knocking either possible philosophy. I mean, filmmaking is a business and they need to make money one way or the other.<br /><br />But what about this film? Well, it's engaging and interesting, if somewhat darker than the light-hearted musical we saw over three decades ago (most viewers shouldn't be surprised by this since it's done by the "master of dark themes" himself, Mr. Burton). But I can also see modern marketers inserting various items into the story in order to lighten it up a bit (the TV room is most notable for this with its homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey).<br /><br />Comparing them -- as one reviewer pointed out -- is like comparing apples to apples. And with respect to the screenplays, he/she is mostly right about that. But this film definitely took less liberties with Roald Dahl's classic book than did the 1971 version. And this film is also not a musical (only a select few numbers are done which mirror the book, and they're all done by the oompa loompas).<br /><br />I also enjoyed a more balanced approach to both Charlie's and Wonka's lives. We get to see more of Wonka and just about the same amount of Charlie in this new adaption.<br /><br />I also think that the casting was perfect. Charlie Bucket (played by Freddie Highmore) was an excellent choice for the main role. I loved him in Finding Neverland, and I still love him after I watched this. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) is creepy and gruff, but strangely enjoyable to watch. My only complaint here would be that I felt more of the "magic" coming from Gene Wilder's portrayal in '71. Here, with Mr. Depp, I didn't feel much magic at all, and only a bit of sympathy and bizarre revulsion toward what Willy Wonka had become. But still, Johnny Depp played him very well ...just differently.<br /><br />My heart still rests with the original film staring Gene Wilder, but this one is certainly entertaining enough to see on the big screen. Although the magic isn't present, there are still many other aspect that'll engage young and old viewers alike, and will surely cause very heated conversations about which adaption is the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>The book as well as the original cinematic presentation holds a special place in My heart, and remains an occasional pleasure for evocative entertainment. I wrote a review for the original film with Gene Wilder here, which remains the optimum adaptation, in My opinion. There are certain noticable comparisons that can be made, however. While Gene Wilder portrays Wonka as more of a misanthropic mad scientist-type of personality, Johnny Depp portrays the "Candy Dandy" character in an effeminate and androgynous manner {somewhat reminiscent of Michael Jackson, sans the perverse connotation; almost like what Jackson wishes he was} with a rather dubious overbite, sometimes even getting in the way of speech leaving him with a slight lisp. Still, that observation matters little in the overall manifestation here, as it was quite enjoyable for its own sake, although I found the one actor used for the Umpah-Loompahs rather pugnacious to be honest, even though Umpah Land is said to be located in some tropical location - I could definitely see the need for makeup here. This may have been an opportunity for Gary Coleman, Emmanuel Lewis, or "Wee Man" to become involved. Also, instead of the flute to call them forth, he utters some sort of amazonian call, and does not sing a bit.<br /><br />Included in this version, the origins of little Willy Wonka as a stuffy dentist's son who refused him sublime Halloween treats - ALL candy in fact, to preserve that bleachy smile encased in a metal contraption reminiscent of the one used in Marilyn Manson's "Sweet Dreams" video. The personal identification opposing his oppressive father is obvious, in his subsequent obsession into the candy fetish.<br /><br />The other actors seem well cast, and the underlying message still gets across. The soundtrack is splendid, rendered marvellously by "Red Wolf" himself, the erubescent Danny Elfman, with vocals included! Actually, I could see him depicting Willy Wonka quite nicely.<br /><br />Overall, a bit 'softer' than the original, but a charming and fun presentation nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>I was never uncertain of Burton's capability to pull together this movie. The book's satirical and playful twisted ness fits right into Burton's M.O (BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW are some of my favorite movies) It is quite evident that Burton had a vision is his mind for this film and for the most part he delivers a fun and satisfying film that serves for vast escapism, even though we have seen most of the content previous to in the original. While we've heard the story before and know exactly what happens to each character, it is still fun to get a tour of Wonka's factory through Burton's vision. The set crew has crafted some visually astounding sets from the Bucket's home to the colorful factory. Scenes that we will recall from the original, such as the boat ride, are more fun and exciting to watch. The original was very somber, but here things are pretty fast paced.<br /><br />With the exception of Depp playing Wonka, all the actors/actresses are duplicating the roles of the characters in the original. Each child plays up their signature bad character trait and Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight in Burton's films and does well here as Charlie's mother. It is Depp's performance that is significantly dissimilar from his counterpart. I believe Depp to be one of the most excellent character actors in Hollywood at this time. He adapts well and commits to his characters. Depp opted to go for the same sarcastic oddity we found with Wilder's Wonka, and his performance was excellent. Danny Elfman's fantastic musical score drives the film in a way that makes every musical scene even more magical. Conceivably an even more perfect team than Depp and Burton is Elfman and Burton, bouncing personalities off each other to create a brilliant mix of offbeat charm that never fails to amuse.<br /><br />Thankfully, the lamentful singing is replaced by the eccentric Oompa Loompa musical numbers. Each number is different and completely funny to watch. Lastly, what is also fun about this film is that you can see glimpses of Burton's other films on display here. The opening credits, which consist of a tour through Wonka's odd chocolate bar assembly line, reminded me a lot of the cookie maker machine in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Also, the Bucket's house looks like it was straightforwardly lifted out of BIG FISH with its odd slant. Just a few things Burton added in to bring together his style. In the end, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY'S plot is reused from the original, but what else did you expect. A few things have been changed to follow more closely to the book. The film is fun, colorful and entertaining. Already pulling in the punters, Willy Wonka is sure to be one of the biggest films of this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Almost everyone remembers "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" fondly.  It so effortlessly captured that sense of childlike innocence and wonder of seeing an impossible dream come to pass.  And if "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" doesn't quite reach that same level of wonderment, it is still a strange and wonderful ride, led by the always visually incomparable Tim Burton and his favorite foil Johnny Depp.  The film focuses, of course, on Willy Wonka (Depp) a brilliant but reclusive candy maker searching for an heir through an elaborate contest.  Five lucky children will discover a golden ticket hidden with their wonka bars, meaning they will tour Wonka's magical factory, not knowing that Wonka's sugary empire will be bequeathed to one of them. Most moviegoers will know the story by heart, but Burton, Depp and screenwriter John August put such a fresh spin on the tale that audiences will not mind seeing the old, familiar faces another time.<br /><br />One of those faces has always served as the crutch of the story: the well-meaning and earnest Charlie Bucket (a superb Freddie Highmore).  He is not strong or fast or tall, but he has a good heart, formed by the loving relationship with his family.  Much of the film's heart is found in the terrific rapport that Charlie has with his family, that include Helena Bonham Carter as his soft-spoken mother, Noah Taylor as his hard-working father, David Morris as the cantankerous Grandpa George and David Kelley as the feisty but big-hearted Grandpa Joe.  The early scenes featuring Charlie and his family are the best of the whole film, giving plenty of hearty laughs and strong  characters.  They all eagerly watch as four of Wonka's golden tickets are found by selfish and undeserving children before they joyously witness Charlie get his hands on the last one by sheer luck.<br /><br />Soon Charlie and his grandfather head to Wonka's factory with the other winners and tour the amazing and impeccably concieved Chocolate Factory.  Alex McDowells' colorful production design and Phillipe Rousselot's vivid cinematography are wonders unto themselves.  But more importantly it's here that we get our first good look at Depp as Wonka.  His performance is a radical departure from Gene Wilder's original portrayal.  Depp's Wonka is self-exile from society due to problems with his dentist daddy (Christopher Lee) disowning him for being a choclatier.  Depp's performance works a little too well at first.  He's distant from the gaggle touring his factory but he's also a a little removed from the audience, who are bound to be caught off-guard by his overtly weird turn as Wonka.  But give Depp and Burton time.  The character grows and starts to emerge from his shell as the movie goes along, aided by great moments of off-kilter humor and Burton's extraordinary visuals, leading to a sweetly satisfying conclusion that never comes off syrupy.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's "Charlie & the Chocolate Factory" is a remake as well as an adaptation of both the Roald Dahl novel and screenplay as well as a visual wonder of a film. Comparing it to "Willy Wonka & the Charlie Factory" it is a lot more faithful to the book and is a lot better visually. All the actors play their parts well; the visual effects, makeup, and set direction are worthy of Oscar nods. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the androgynous candy maker is spectacular. People compare his performance to Michael Jackson, and there's obviously some Jacko in there, but he also reminded me of an equally controversial singer (Marilyn Manson). The look Depp has in the film brought to mind both Manson and Jackson, the voice Jackson. Whatever it is, Depp is great. The script, adapted by John August, has a lot more depth; Even diving into Wonka's childhood. Burton is still himself, the film has the Burton mood and music (composed by Danny Elfman). Anyway, the film is about Charlie (Freddie Highmore, Finding Neverland) who lives with his father (Noah Taylor), his mother (Helena Bonham Carter) and his bedridden grandparents in their lopsided house. Everyday, Charlie passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A factory which has been open for a while, but seems to never have anybody going in or out. But then suddenly it is announced that Willy Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in candy bars that are to be shipped around the world. Anyway, same ol' story; Charlie finds the golden ticket and along with four other children go into Wonka's famous factory. Now for the children and their parents. Well, there are some changes. The parents of the children are quite different. The kids are pretty much the same; Augustus Gloop is a fat disgusting child. Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat. Violet Beauregard is a competitive gum chewing over-achieving little girl. And then Mike Teevee is still the kid who sits in front of the TV all day, except this time he plays video games. The Oompa-Loompa's have changed quite a bit as well. Instead of the green haired, orange faced midgets we're used too. We have a single actor (Deep Roy) playing the Oompa-Loompa's who now merely wear orange jumpsuits. Very well done. A-.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>By creating a beautifully crafted town with a mysterious chocolate factory at one end of the town and the struggling Bucket family living in a shabby, tilted and weather beaten house at the other end, the audience was treated to a wonderful journey.<br /><br />The chocolate bar making at the factory in the opening credits was a great animation sequence, especially the wrapping of the bars by the robotic hands. Don't enter the cinema late!<br /><br />While the Bucket family was deprived from food and material comforts, it was more than made up for by the love and attention among the son, parents and 4 grandparents. Charlie's quest for one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory was never smooth and easy. His heart (so did the audience's) sank lower each time the news announced another ticket found elsewhere and he himself unwrapped another ticketless bar. The atmosphere was intense when Charlie's grandparent sent him to buy one more bar with his own last coin. When the screen darkened as the grandfather closed his eyes, the audience suspected that the grandfather was just gone for good. Not so, fortunately.<br /><br />The second part of the movie took us to watch how the rich kids, succumbed to temptations (gluttony, spoiledness, competitveness, TV game addiction), were eliminated one after another (reality show?). In the nut sorting room, when the innocent looking squirrels, sensing the threat of the approaching girl, stopped their nut-cracking and prepared for attack, gave people the creeps.<br /><br />Charlie's grandparents and parents, with their big screen shots, have displayed their love of Charlie well. But it was Freddie Highmore who was a natural. He portrayed the young and determined Charlie who would not give up his family for anything else. Johnny Depp, with his sinister look every now and then when he detected the unlovable traits of the "sophisticated" children, built up an unpredictable and secretive air around him.<br /><br />The inside of the factory was richly imagined and luxuriously decorated, from a food paradise of luscious colours to top of the notch invention room and flying elevator. The movie succeeded in placing that the people at the centre, they were never dwarfed nor sidetracked by the special effects and the colorful props.<br /><br />Does the movie appeal to the child side in every person? Absolutely. Does the film appeal to the adult side in every one? To some extent. Yes. A delightful movie with a heart this is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>The 2005 version of the classic children's book is much closer to the original than most people (having grown up with Gene Wilder) might care to realize. Yet, this story about the mysterious candy maker does indulge in some liberties of its own.<br /><br />In addition to updated special effects, it attempted to explain why Willy Wonka ended up the way he did.<br /><br />Willy Wonka (Depp) was himself an unfortunate child at one point. He grew up with a sinister dentist father and never quite forgot the experience. Even when he became famous and rich, Wonka remembered where he came from. This gives him something to empathize with. The film honestly could have flown without this subplot being tucked in, but because it (again owning to Burton's direction more than anything) did not distract from the overall storyline, the inclusion is tolerable.<br /><br />The Wonka in this film is a gothic metrosexual type. Frankly when I looked at him, I first thought of Marilyn Manson or another shock rocker. While I usually only see remakes of classic films (regardless of how accurate the originals themselves really were) only because there is nothing else to do, the idea of seeing 'Marilyn Manson' give spoiled brats (who, yes, are especially mean in this film) their just deserts was something which I could not miss. Sure enough, it provided me with a tasty summer treat.<br /><br />Ed Wood did a marvelous job with this film, understanding Dahl's original work. Because Dahl's work was never meant to be 'family friendly' these two are the perfect combination for each other<br /><br />It's so easy these days for studios to attempt substituting flashy graphics and other special effects for any semblance of plot, but the special effect innovations in this film were used sparingly.  Even the computer-replicated oompa loompas looked remarkably real and were not just thrown in for the sake of it. Plus, they've got some new songs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Note: While I indeed like the percentage rating, I am refusing to rewrite this review, because I am way too happy with it to just delete it.  Still, I'm giving it a percentage.<br /><br />First off, I love Tim Burton.  Quentin Tarantino is cemented as my favorite director, but if I had to choose other favorites, Tim Burton is easily one of my other favorite directors.  Granted, he's not a genius as much as some of his saviors would like you to believe (you know the kind), and I don't rate all of his movies five stars or even four stars (Pee-Wee's Playhouse and The Nightmare Before Christmas are prime examples).  However, I think he's more than just some goth symbol.  He makes great movies that really have great visual styles, and for the most part, he's an inspired director and someone I can always count on for making something good.<br /><br />Except when he tries to redo other movies.  Granted, he's only had only one other re-make, but Planet of The Apes stunk up something fierce, and this one isn't much better.  I actually don't like the Willy Wonka movie that much either (I actually like the book more), but it's not a bad movie for good reasons, and there are parts in the movie that  seem very heartwarming (god I hate that word).  If felt engaging many times, and while it's also kind of dated, it still retains some form of engagment and emotion.  This movie, on the other hand, left me feeling cold throughout, with nothing to grab onto, with no character development.  Visual style can only take you so far, and while I liked some of it, it didn't do enough to save the film from becoming a total mess.<br /><br />This isn't a terrible movie by any stretch, but there's just not anything to grab onto.  Tim Burton is usually known for his quirkness and strangeness (boy, how dumb does that sound), but I always thought  he did so in a way that was always engaging, really making the world, characters, or situations come to life in some way.  In this one, the weirdness is there because he wants to be weird.  It does nothing to bring the world to life, just makes the world seem like a place that reminds you of a retirement home.  I actually have felt more emotions at a retirement home than this movie, I'm not even joking.  Plus, unlike the book which still had the heart but some of the deranged fun, this one doesn't have much with the sterile characters, and the two main people: Charlie and Wonka, being incredibly annoying on both counts.<br /><br />Ah, the annoying characters.  An example of this one would be the main character himself, Willy Wonka (?).  This Willy Wonka is just plain annoying and totally unengaging.  He has no real motivation in his actions, makes the stupidest and lame jokes, and just seems like the kind of person that tries to be all weird but in any case comes off looking like a person starved for attention.  The lame subplot about his father was also worthless, a backstory that made me feel absolutely nothing and did nothing to make me like this character at all.  Besides, when you don't give two _________ about the character now, why did you think I would care now?  He's annoying, he's weird because he can't offer anything else, and comparing the two characters makes you realize how much more soulless this Wonka is (The Nostalgia Critic did some cool comparisons, although I have no idea where the heck James Bond villian came from).<br /><br />I also liked the way the Nostalgia Critic pointed out how the Charlie character in this one is underdeveloped and annoyingly perfect.  This is a boyscout indeed, a kid that is so perfect and unrealistic that you just want to deck whoever put together this moron kid together.  As he said, the Charlie in the Wonka version (his name is in the title of the BOOK FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!) is kind, but is more like a kid.  He can get greedy, he is tempted at times, but really comes out at the end after conflict (at the end).  He's more like a real kid.  He's crucial to the story, which makes it all the better since he's engaging while the focus of this movie does not involve a character that's in any way interseting.  See above for that reason.<br /><br />However, there are some improvements, although most are on the visual front.  The whole chocolate River is much improved, the original version did very much look like liquid _________.  The river in here was extremely gloppy and looked very much like chocolate.  I also thought the gobstopper was improved, I mean, what were the original gobstoppers supposed to me modeled after.  The factory is kind of interesting to see at times, but not entirely all the time.  It's kind of a person thing, but I think it overall looks pretty cool for the most part, and Tim Burton knows his stuff (too bad it didn't save the movie).<br /><br />There are some plot points cleared up, and the character updates shows they weren't entirely lazy (Gloop is pretty much the same).  The updates of Mike, and ESPECIALLY Violet, are very welcome.  I also like seeing the kids come out after their survival through the factory.  However, Veruca Salt was not improved at all, as the one in the earlier version was so __________ spoiled and bratty that you wanted to beat for being such a bratty son of a __________.  And the opening parts weren't that bad either, although nothing special considering the characters weren't that interesting, so setting up uninteresting characters doesn't really make the movie better.  It would only count if the characters were actually interesting.  And when they do, there's not much screen time anyway.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing.  The MUSICALS NUMBERS $U(% @$$!!!!!!!  The whole different songs played during each kid's demise are totally annoying.  Why Elfman why?  Oh.  _______ the Willy Wonka song.  Eh, at least it's better than A Whole New World.<br /><br />Sorry Burton, I love ya, but I'm not a patsy.  It's worth a shot if your a Burton fan, but if you are going into the movie expecting to see something akin to the original, you're in for a rude awakening.  I'm actually glad I saw this movie for some Tim Burton greatness scattered about, but there wasn't that much.  It's kind of too bad.  Oh well.  I'm glad Ed Wood was released on DVD in special edition.<br /><br />Directing: 7/10<br />Characters: 3/10<br />Improvements in visual style 4/5<br />musical numbers 0/5<br />plot: 1/10</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Charlie and Chocolate Factory" is a  expensive, creepy  film. It's perverse on a level kids may not get but does transmit to adults, who might wonder what director Tim Burton, and star Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, are getting at, exactly. It's dark, episodic and surprisingly unfunny, aiming for that demographic that enjoy watching episodes of "Maury" where the bad kids get sent to boot camp to get humiliated and browbeaten.<br /><br />True, the book by Roald Dahl is not exactly a lark: Five children are invited to the reclusive Willy Wonka's massive confection factory after finding golden tickets inside their candy bar wrappers and four of them are ironically punished for their various bad habits.  One impoverished Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is polite and reserved during his visit, and thus rewarded for being the kind of child Dahl preferred: The saint.<br /><br />Played by Highmore as a nice, shy boy, Charlie finds his golden ticket in the third Wonka chocolate bar he buys; he takes his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly in a diminished, useless role) to Wonka's factory just down the road. He's joined by lard German Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled English aristocrat Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and two competitive American punks, Violet Biodegrade (AnnaSophia Robb) and Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry). Gloop is a glutton, and the rest are grabby and annoying. But none of them know what to make of Willy Wonka, played by Depp as if he were channeling...someone very strange.<br /><br />Is it Michael Jackson? Vogue editor Anna Wintour? Jude Law's character in "Artificial Intelligence?" A John Malkovich villain? It's mannered and organic - clearly Depp had to rewrite some of this material toward his characterization - and a rallying point for the bad kids.  These brats don't much like anyone, but they have reason to suspect and loathe Willy.<br /><br /> So when Gloop, Mike, Veruca, Violet get theirs in Burton's vision, their calamities are presented straight away while a bemused, detached, fey Depp looks on in his bob haircut. Burton also cloned one actor (Deep Roy) through CGI for all the Oompa Loompas, whose primary function is to perform dance numbers closely parroting 1970s songs most kids wouldn't know, the lyrics of which zoom by with such speed you don't know what the Oompas are singing about anyway.<br /><br />Burton never really brackets these numbers, or many of the scenes in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." The movie just unfurls, unaware of its own rhythm, unwilling to comment on anything except Willy's childhood (one of those classic Burton deals of a father isolating his son) that doesn't begin to explain Depp's behavior. He's Willy Weirdo, not Wonka, and that the movie made a pile of dough is not a tribute to its quality but marketing and a lack of audience taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I know I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't jumping up and down about this movie. I loved the book as a child and loved the original film with Gene Wilder for its own original contributions...perhaps I'm biased. Still, I have always admired Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's work, and had been looking forward to this new interpretation of Roald Dahl's book.<br /><br />This film was, indeed, more true to the book than the 1971 version...the squirrel room, the jungle scene, the children leaving the factory, perhaps a little "wiser for the wear." However, the character development of the 1971 version was MUCH better than here...you were actually given an opportunity to like or dislike each character, including Willy Wonka. I did think that Johnny Depp's portrayal of Wonka was more true to the book than Gene Wilder's...Willy Wonka is supposed to be quite childish and eccentric. However, I thought that this film's preoccupation with being true to the book caused it to overlook what is more important, which is to establish the intentions of each character. At least in the 1971 version, it's pretty clear what each character's intentions are...even if establishing some of these intentions requires a conspiracy involving "Slugworth." And though I haven't read the book in a very long time, I do NOT remember any details being given as to Willy Wonka's childhood...I thought these were unnecessary, distracting, and a waste of time. This energy could have been better spent on the children's' character development, in my opinion. This is, after all, supposed to be a story for and about children.<br /><br />The oompa loompas. It's true that they are physically portrayed accurately here more so than in the 1971 version, i.e. very small people and not midgets with orange skin and green hair. However, though the songs they sing here are true to the book, they are less charismatic than those of the 1971 film and sometimes seem over the top. Also, I didn't like that they were all clones of each other...I think that was a poor choice.<br /><br />Finally, I was appalled with the ending...this ties in with my previous comments re: Willy Wonka's childhood. It changed the whole idea behind the story itself, which is supposed to be (from my perspective) that people can overcome their hardships to have a happy and prosperous ending, as long as they're honest, selfless, and generous. This movie changes the whole theme of the story to one that emphasizes the importance of family over any kind of material wealth or prosperity. Both are perfectly good and legitimate themes, but my reading of the book left me with an impression that Roald Dahl was more concerned with the former theme than the latter. Accordingly then, this movie did not do the book justice in the most important and fundamental way, whereas the 1971 film was able to do so despite its shortcomings. My kids didn't quite enjoy this film, I mean can you blame them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>From the opening scenes of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I expected to see Michael Keaton in the batsuit pop out at any moment. For, make no mistake, Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic novel, is very "Burton-esque." The crazy visuals and wacky characters abound. Depp's performance is kinda rediculous, though there are moments where he's funny. The kids, however, are very good. They are the star of the film, in my opinion. Freddie Highmore gives the best performance of the film as Charlie, and his portrayal of the character is the only thing that is better than "Willie Wonka," as he doesn't whine and complain like Peter Ostrum.<br /><br />The funniest scene in the movie is the TV-Room. If you, like me, are a fan of "2001: A Space Odyssey," then you'll be dying lauging at this part.<br /><br />Despite Burton's freaky visual style and Depp's ludicrous performance, kids and parents will find much to appreciate in this film. But I still recommend "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" over this one.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>This film did not need to be made.  I guess that is my main problem with it.  I wanted to enjoy it, because I loved the classic, but this is a far cry from that.  The original was a dark comedy...this film just made everything too right at the end.<br /><br />The beginning was also way too drawn out.  Come on, we all know that Charlie eventually gets a golden ticket...let's get on with the story already.<br /><br />Depp had me laughing at a couple parts and the obsessive sports-mom had a few good lines, but otherwise I was unimpressed.  How about originality out of Hollywood?  Wow, does every film need to be remade?  Can't you people think of anything new?</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and lots of fun stuff, approved by Dahl's daughter (a producer), can only make me believe that this is a definitve version. Roald Dahl didn't like the first version (with Gene Wilder), and it was risky to attempt a new version, but Burton is intelligent enough to do it right. One thing I didn't get was, if the old grandfather worked for Willy Wonka, why didn't Willy age accordingly. As Dahl intended, it's a lesson that rotten little spoiled kids will not always get everything they want. Previous reviewers made references to Michael Jackson, and other nonsense. What I experienced was a fine version of Dahl's difficult story, well presented and very entertaining. What I got out of it, as the book intended, is that greedy kids won't always get what they want; that a poor kid with dreams and hope may get more. The combination of Burton and Depp has never failed to entertain me (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood). Both are among the most talented artists in the film medium, and I enjoy that. "Charlie" is another feather in Burton's cap, and Depp, with his intelligent side-glances, removes any doubt that he's the finest actor today, risky and complete.  If you know the book, you'll understand. If you don't, just enjoy the film. Burton did a fine job.</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>Of that Wonka bar! Holla, my peepenheimers - I finally gave into my curiousity and watched the new "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" directed by the highly overrated Tim Burton and the almost equally overrated Johnny Depp.  PUH-LEASE!!<br /><br />Look, I will not disguise my absolute unabashedly love for the original classic masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009FGWLW">Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>. Gene Wilder is pure genious as Mr. Wonka, in a performance that simply cannot be repeated, bettered, or even equalled.  Depp was foolishly ill-prepared to try.  Whereas Wilder invested a truly menacing, disturbing side to Wonka, Depp makes him simply 'kinda weird'.  Thumbs (and gobstoppers) down to him.<br /><br />Much is always celebrated about Tim Burton's visual and overall atmosphere created in his movies.  Yeah, he is a capable visual stylist.  But it matters very little when he doesn't do anything else right!  I'm not saying he never has (I loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302477751">Frankenweenie</a>). But more often enough he just comes across like a dork.<br /><br />I liked Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompa's (and he was also the film's narrator).  But I thought the new Charlie was too goody-goody and he embarrassed his grandpa.  After his Grandpa was happy about being able to go to the factory, Charlie was all "Oh but I should sell the ticket to help the family" and made his Grandpa look like a big jerk.  There is a limit to how "helpful" a child should be.  Talk about a killjoy.  The actor playing the Grandpa is utterly delightful!  Best performance in the film.<br /><br />I didn't like the kids as much as in the original. I don't mean the young actors themselves, heavens no. I think Burton gave them one direction, something along the lines of: "Oh, you've all seen the original movie, right? Cool, just act like that."  I don't blame them.  Some of them talented, especially Anna Sofia Robb who shined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NZ2KG">Because of Winn-Dixie</a>.  But I don't know why they used a digital fake for Agustus Gloop instead of a real boy!</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>The new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory represents exactly what the audience should expect from a Tim Burton film: exuberant sets that challenge all possible camera angles and show a kitsch quality; weird supporting characters that prove to be a critic and piercing look at the American suburban world, Danny Elfman's exquisite music and as a cherry top, the presence of Johnny Depp, in his fifth collaboration with Burton.<br /><br />The original 1971 film had a clear anchor in the pop visual look of the times; Burton's film evokes some 60's pictures in his art direction, photography and in the sweet innocence quality that all movies lack in the present. Without a doubt, the production design, art direction, costumes and sets are worthy of an Oscar; as well as Elfman's score, who added music to the verses written by Ronald Dahl, the author of the book.<br /><br />Likewise, we should speak of Johnny Depp's performance for his extraordinary creation of Wonka. Compared to Gene Wilder's character in the 71' film, Depp's Wonka is more repressed, more peculiar and far more apt to this version, because it looks real and nostalgia-free.<br /><br />The casting was terrific, from my point of view, and no one dissapointed in that department. A special mention to the man who played the Oompa Loompas...he was just superb and hilarious, in a freaky way, but terrific!!<br /><br />In conclusion, I think Burton's version is superior, its ending more wholesome and its sensibility definitely more contemporary. This movie has updated all the elements that became somewhat obsolete in the 1971 film. All these aspects have enriched the story, and this makes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a very sweet treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>Many people are really going to dislike this movie.  Many of them before they ever see the movie.  "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is such a beloved classic and many people never wanted to see the movie re-made.  But theres something that you have to take into account.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  Those two have collaborated four times and the three previous would spectacular, so you would have to believe that this movie would be great.  And staying true to their form, the movie is great.<br /><br />The story is the same as the previous film.  The owner of the greatest chocolate factory in the world, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), decides to let five children and a guardian of each to take a tour of his factory that has been closed to the public and to everyone for years.  They can take the tour if they find one of five golden tickets inside of the Wonka Bars.  Also one lucky kid will win a special prize.  So obviously, people go nuts trying to find these golden tickets by buying just about every Wonka Bar in sight.  Four of the golden tickets are found by fairly wealthy, spoiled kids and then the last one is found by sweet, very poor Charlie Buckett.  The kids are given a tour of the chocolate factory by Willy Wonka himself.  While in the factory, kids that are greedy, fat, cocky and too smart start disappearing out of the factory due to their behavior.  Kind of like what happens in Se7en.  The last kid left with Willy Wonka is Charlie and he wins the grand prize, The Chocolate Factory.  Did I really need to write all of that?<br /><br />First thing that people will judge is Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka compared to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka.  The thing that you will have to understand is that they are portraying two different Willy Wonka's.  Wilder's was sweet, charming and caring of the children.  Depp's is very cocky, paranoid and socially inept.  So to judge one character to another is like comparing apples and oranges.  My opinion is that Johnny Depp does a fantastic job with the character.  I like the darker Willy Wonka that he plays and honestly, who could play this character better than Johnny Depp?  Also who could direct this film better than Tim Burton.  One of the songs from the original has a line that says "in a world of pure imagination."  Is there any director with a greater imagination than Burton?  The colors, the odd shapes, the acting, along with Danny Elfman's creepy score all screams Tim Burton's classic film style.  The rest of the cast does a good job, but this movie is the Willy Wonka Show.<br /><br />So would I recommend this movie?  Definitely!  Is it better than the original?  I liked this movies darker setting, but it just matters on what your movie taste is.  So I would say that if you don't like Tim Burton movies, then don't see this movie.  If you like Tim Burton's style, then this is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a fantasy film based on the popular children's novel written by Roald Dahl. This movie stars Johnny Depp in the lead role, joined by a cast that includes some old and new names in Hollywood.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this movie was the visual effects. The scene with the squirrels checking the nuts; the scene with the young girl transforming into a blueberry; etc. are creative and fun. In addition to the visuals, there is plenty of music to keep viewers entertained, with a full soundtrack of songs written by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />Depp is great as the eccentric yet friendly Willy Wonka, and he exhibits a certain degree of charm that makes his character intriguing. The kids are also very good, and each one of the five children (the ones who win the right to tour the factory) has his/her own unique personality that is brought to his/her respective roles. The older people in the movie are ok, but not necessarily anything spectacular. Depp and the five children command most of the screen throughout the film, so you don't really notice the older people very much.<br /><br />This film is similar to the plot taken by the novel it is based on, but there are a few changes, like one would expect. One change that I didn't particularly care for was the subplot where Mr. Wonka has flashbacks to his childhood and later tries to patch up his relationship with his dad. I think the film would have been better if this was left out.<br /><br />Most people will think of this as an immature movie, but I liked it more and more as I watched. The fast pace, the cast, the music, and, most importantly, the visual effects make this a movie for everyone to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>By creating a beautifully crafted town with a mysterious chocolate factory at one end of the town and the struggling Bucket family living in a shabby, tilted and weather beaten house at the other end, the audience was treated to a wonderful journey.<br /><br />The chocolate bar making at the factory in the opening credits was a great animation sequence, especially the wrapping of the bars by the robotic hands. Don't enter the cinema late!<br /><br />While the Bucket family was deprived from food and material comforts, it was more than made up for by the love and attention among the son, parents and 4 grandparents. Charlie's quest for one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory was never smooth and easy. His heart (so did the audience's) sank lower each time the news announced another ticket found elsewhere and he himself unwrapped another ticketless bar. The atmosphere was intense when Charlie's grandparent sent him to buy one more bar with his own last coin. When the screen darkened as the grandfather closed his eyes, the audience suspected that the grandfather was just gone for good. Not so, fortunately.<br /><br />The second part of the movie took us to watch how the rich kids, succumbed to temptations (gluttony, spoiledness, competitveness, TV game addiction), were eliminated one after another (reality show?). In the nut sorting room, when the innocent looking squirrels, sensing the threat of the approaching girl, stopped their nut-cracking and prepared for attack, gave people the creeps.<br /><br />Charlie's grandparents and parents, with their big screen shots, have displayed their love of Charlie well. But it was Freddie Highmore who was a natural. He portrayed the young and determined Charlie who would not give up his family for anything else. Johnny Depp, with his sinister look every now and then when he detected the unlovable traits of the "sophisticated" children, built up an unpredictable and secretive air around him.<br /><br />The inside of the factory was richly imagined and luxuriously decorated, from a food paradise of luscious colours to top of the notch invention room and flying elevator. The movie succeeded in placing that the people at the centre, they were never dwarfed nor sidetracked by the special effects and the colorful props.<br /><br />Does the movie appeal to the child side in every person? Absolutely. Does the film appeal to the adult side in every one? To some extent. Yes. A delightful movie with a heart this is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>This was a really creepy rendition of a great classic movie. Even thought the special-effects are many times better, this version of the story has lost all of the charm. Lame and disturbing. The original was much better.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>2.5 stars.  I had long thought that Depp was a remarkable actor.  I remember over a decade ago when I shared that thought with some movie friends and was literally laughed at, now it's an accepted fact. Woo hoo for me.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is just another shiny example of the risks Johnny is willing to take to bring us unique characters and one of the things about this film I like is his total committment to his performance.  Course there was something inconsistent about an arrested developed man seeming to not like children.  Given his history with his father, I could understand him not liking parents, but in the movie, he really seemed to get along with them better.  Still a good Michael Jackson impersonation.  And for that I say Bravo.  The other great things about this the movie are the wonderful sets for Willy Wonka's extraordianry chocolate factory.  They are literally eye candy for the movie audience.  But as a whole, I can't say that I was blown away by this movie.  In fact, there are portions of the movie where I was bored and was entertaining doing a few house chores instead--and I HATE chores.  Anyway, this goes to show that sometimes even great performances can't save a movie.  Overall: watch at your own risk.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>yet another collaboration twixt tim burton and johnny depp produces what will forever be deemed a remake of the gene wilder "willie wonka" of a generation earlier.  this time around the movie is darker, and i will leave it for the individual viewer to decide which take you prefer.  me?  i tend to think both movies are a bit overdone, tho i find both entertaining on their own levels.  and the added attraction here is the presence of freddie highmore, a talented and pulchritudinous young actor who makes anything worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Tim Burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in Hollywood.  From his stop-animation work ("The Corpse Bride") to dark romances ("Edward Scissorhands") to horror ("Sleepy Hollow"), Burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there, but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension.<br /><br />Perhaps no other director was so suited to film Roald Dahl's most famous work, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," and remain true to the author's vision.  Most people associate the tamer, goofy "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," starring Gene Wilder, with Dahl's tale, but forget that Dahl had a healthy streak of Lemony Snicket sensibility to him.  So it is perfect that Burton makes a darker, more dangerous film for all to enjoy.<br /><br />The visuals in "Charlie" are astounding.  The chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate (not the icky brown water of "Willie Wonka"), and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design.  And that is not all - oh, no, that is not all!<br /><br />Possibly the most visually stunning element in "Charlie" is Willie Wonka himself, played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.  Depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them, and one wonders what inspired Depp's quirky, nervous, mean-spirited, selfish concoction.  Depp plays Wonka as tight as he plays Jack Sparrow loose, and he never misses a note. But whereas Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka was more genial puppetmaster, Depp's Wonka has a sadistic streak in him, perhaps instilled by his dentist father.  This is a great, if much-maligned, performance.<br /><br />The most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the Oompa-Loompas, Wonka's army of diminutive henchmen.  In the Wilder film, the Oompa-Loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy "oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do" tune.  In this version, all the Oompa-Loompas are played by the same character (even though there are hundreds of them), and their dance numbers are even more fantastic.  However, the songs don't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs, which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest. Indeed, there are several lyrics that I just couldn't catch in this film version, and that is a pretty major quibble.<br /><br />Far from a feel-good movie, but definitely a good movie, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" deserves to be seen and, for fans of artistic visions, studied.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Tim Burton, 2005)<br /><br />The best way to look at Tim Burton's new reimagining of Roald Dahl's classic kids' novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is that it's a reimagining of the source material rather than a remake of the older film. They descend from a common ancestor, but have no more in common than you or I do with the Monkey Chain of Trust. (Well, not me. I'm not so sure about you sometimes.)<br /><br />In some ways, this version is closer to the source material than the older one-- for example, they have the right Oompa-Loompa songs this time (and thank Heaven for that). For about half the film, the kids seem truer to their book roots, as well, though things have been updated a bit (Mike Teevee, for example, is now a videogame devotee instead of a watcher of TV Westerns; either way, he gets his daily quantity of violence). Apart from that, though, this movie diverges as widely from the book as does the first one, but in decidedly odder ways. Not that this should be much of a surprise from Burton.<br /><br />The character of Willy Wonka, played here with far more an air of overt menace than Gene Wilder took in the original film, is the principal oddity. Wilder played things off as a nice fatherly sort of chap, which made it kind of hard to believe when he suddenly turned around and started raging. Depp's Wonka is thoroughly screwed up from the very start, and were I a ten-year-old about to accompany him into a factory, I'd have to check to make sure chocolate hadn't gotten into my britches on a regular basis. Whereas Wilder's Wonka was all about showing off the goodies, and taking as much delight in them as the kids did, Depp's version wanders through the landscape as if he has no idea what he's looking at. Positively creepy. (This makes the cutting of the original film's most infamous scene, the boat ride, all the more inexplicable.) One could make a pretty strong argument for Depp's character mirroring Willem Dafoe's brilliant performance as Count Orlok in Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire rather than anything that came out of the mind of either Dahl or Wilder.<br /><br />It's not a bad comparison, though one has to buy the idea that Depp himself actually took the path that Murnau (John Malkovich) provided as Orlok's cover story in Shadow. Depp looked into the motivations of his character, which are explored in depth here, and came up with a neurotic bag of bones who's so ill-socialized that, even when it comes to the moment he's been dreaming of these past few years, we still can't buy it. I'm relatively sure no one reading this review could possibly have gone their entire lives without seeing either the original film or this one, but I'll still not spoil the ending for you; let's just say that when it happens, it doesn't sit right.<br /><br />This is an immensely interesting film for all the wrong reasons. Johnny Depp's character is endlessly fascinating, but that's a whole different ball of wax than saying Willy Wonka, or the film that surrounds him, is immensely interesting. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>When popular philosopher Barry White shared these immortal words with America, he might easily have been working from the Roald Dahl playbook.  Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is an oddly moralistic tale about the hazards of excess, not just of sweets, but parental indulgence, competitiveness, and aggression.  The question is, why remake it?  Fortunately, there are many valid reasons.<br /><br />While Gene Wilder has given us many wonderful performances, his rendition was too drenched in saccharine musical theatre numbers to satisfy and now looks dated.  Tim Burton, by contrast, brings not only his reliably astonishing visual imagination to the party, but also a bittersweet sensibility perfectly in keeping with Dahl's perspective.  Lucky for us he also brings frequent co-conspirator Johnny Depp, and musical wiz Danny Elfman.  In addition to being one of our very best actors, Depp is most drawn to roles that offer interesting challenges.  His Willy Wonka, in addition to being a sartorial splendor, is part perpetual child, part mad scientist, part eccentric gazillionaire, and part absent-minded professor.  That he allows justice to work itself out in his presence is more a matter of absent-mindedness than malevolence.  Indeed, the faults of the children involved - and their parents - appear to provide their own lessons and punishments with little help from Willy.<br /><br />From black and gray cityscapes reminiscent of Batman to color so dazzling you might request a pair of Charlie's oversize sunglasses, this film gives your eyes a workout they will never forget - simply spectacular.  Special recognition must be given to Deep Roy who, through the miracle of digital technology, plays all of the innumerable Oompa Loompas.  With almost no lines he manages to improve every scene he's in, and the musical numbers, which draw from Busby Berkeley to Saturday Night Fever and all points in between, are simply fantastic.  (Elfman really came through on these, they have a hip, ironic sensibility thoroughly lacking in the Wilder version.)<br /><br />That Helena Bonham Carter was willing to lend her name to the project when she has little to do but chop cabbage tells you a great deal about the quality level.  Finally, Charlie Bucket, played winningly by Freddie Highmore, is every bit as ingratiating and unassuming as we would like him to be, he deserves his good fortune.  (After seeing the headgear Willy had to wear as a child, you will agree that he deserves a break too.)  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have done it again, a wonderful movie worth owning and watching many times.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>When Johnny Depp and Tim Burton team up to do a movie the results are usually fantastic: Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and to a lesser degree Sleepy Hollow. However, since Planet of the Apes, Burton's films have been missing that certain personal touch - the fascination with darkness mixed with a touch of wonderment - that used to make them so good. Fans keep hoping that his next movie will be a return to form but it hasn't happened yet. So, anticipation was high for Burton's latest, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starring Depp as none other than Willy Wonka. If anybody could successfully tap into Dahl's sensibilities it would be Burton, but could he equal Gene Wilder's memorable and much beloved take in 1971?<br /><br />Depp plays Wonka like a funky mix of the optimistic Ed Wood, the arrested development of Andy Kaufman and the flash of a kids show host. It's a typically off-kilter performance by Depp who proves that his recent foray into big budget movies (Pirates of the Caribbean) hasn't ruined his ability to create memorable characters. Depp's Wonka doesn't really like the kids with the exception of Charlie and barely conceals his contempt for them and this comes out in funny asides or amusing facial expressions from the rubber-faced Depp. There are also hints of deep regret and a damaged psyche as the film progresses and Wonka's troubled past is fleshed out (this is the major point where the film deviates from the book) explaining his motivations. As he did in Pirates of the Caribbean, Depp plays it broad creating his own Wonka that isn't better or worse than Wilder's - just different.<br /><br />Burton wisely doesn't try to remake the Wilder film but goes back to Dahl's book. This is the first film since Sleepy Hollow to feel like a truly authentic Tim Burton film as he really connects with the material in a big way. It's almost as if reconnecting with Depp on this film (and Corpse Bride) has helped the filmmaker find his way back to what made his films so interesting in the first place. Let's hope that this is the beginning of a move back to more personal films like Ed Wood and a distancing of director-for-hire projects like Apes and Big Fish.<br /><br />Included is the obligatory theatrical trailer.<br /><br />"Attack of the Squirrels" shows how an animal wrangler trained the squirrels for a scene in the movie. For most of the squirrels, it took 2,000 repetitions to learn a specific task.<br /><br />"Fantastic Mr. Dahl" takes a look at author Roald Dahl with vintage archival footage of the man and testimony from his friends, family and collaborators.<br /><br />"Becoming Oompa-Loompa" examines how they took actor Deep Roy and transformed him into an army of Oompa-Loompas thanks to CGI. Of all the actors, he had to work the hardest playing so many different roles that was then augmented by special effects.<br /><br />"Making the Mix" is a collection of featurettes that explore various aspects of the movie, including the origins of the project, the changes they made from the book, the casting process (including the kids), Danny Elfman's score and how he approached such a daunting task, costume and production design and finally the special effects. Thankfully, Burton relied as much on practical sets and miniatures as possible with the CGI done only to compliment the real sets.<br /><br />Also included are several interactive games.<br /><br />"Oompa-Loompa Dance" takes you through two dances from the movie and then you have to try and keep an Oompa-Loompa dancing by following the corresponding moves.<br /><br />In "The Bad Nut" you have to help Wonka's squirrels sort good and bad nuts with only three tries to get it right.<br /><br />"The Inventing Machine" allows you to make your own candy and test it on an Oompa-Loompa.<br /><br />Finally, there is the "Search for the Golden Ticket" which allows you to help the five children find their respective ticket through a series of games.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" is impressive!

But his films are also often about the search for a father, either real or emotionally as in "Big Fish" again and "Edward Scissorhands."<br />Burton's version of the Willie Wonka story is about both, the dreamer: Willie and Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and the search for a father:  the very strange acting and looking Willie Wonka of Johnny Depp for his estranged father, Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee). Roald Dahl's source material as well as this film share the common theme of men aching from the loss of and searching for the most important relationship in a man's life: the bond between a man and his father.<br />Burton's world is also one of perfection and beauty: think the Technicolor gone bananas neighborhood of "Edward Scissorhands." Philippe Roussellot's production here is likewise blindingly gorgeous and eye-poppingly dense with color and artful design.<br />This version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is much closer to that of Dahl's in that it is wittier and likewise naughtily misanthropic than the previous Gene Wilder version. Burton's "CATCF" is sly and malicious, particularly in his treatment of the children that Willie tours around his factory. As in Dahl's story, these children represent a good part of the 7 Deadly sins: Gluttony in the guise of the chubby Augustus Gloop, Greed and Anger in the perfectly page-boyed and unctuous Violet Beauregarde, Pride in the obnoxious Mike Teavee (to whom Willie is perpetually saying "Stop Mumbling, I can't understand you!" when his speech is perfectly understandable) and Anger and Envy in the spoiled brattiness of Veruca Salt. Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and his family stand alone as the embodiment of goodness, caring and love and they alone benefit from Charlie's visit to the Factory.<br />Burton and Depp have a great time putting these kids and their parents in their "place" and though it is a bit cruel, it is fun for us nonetheless: we participate in the action despite our better judgment. And this is the genius of Burton's version of this material: it's dark, it's wicked but it's also full of whimsy and wonder: it's just a hell of a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Charlie and The Chocolate Factory," a movie by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. That says a lot doesn't it? Would you be expecting weird, or what? Remember, these guys have teamed up in "Edward Scissorhands" and "The Corpse Bride." Well, you can also add the music of Danny Elfman, former leader of "Oingo Boingo" fame. Strange, strange movie. Oh, and by the way, if you've ever had the experience of a "fixer-upper" house or have even considered it, viewing the "fixer-upper" in this movie is worth the admission or DVD price.<br /><br />In any case, the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory, closed for some time with all the employees fired, has reopened and has offered a "Golden Ticket" to the first five people who find it inside five of their Willy Wonka Chocolate Bars sold on a world-wide basis. Their prize is a one-day all-you-can-eat tour of the new factory. The first four tickets were easy to find and, let's-just-say, they went to kids that you or Johnny Depp, the leader of the tour, would probably not care to spend a day with. The fifth kid, Charlie, came from an extended family who lived in the "fixer-upper" place and he was accompanied by his grandfather, a former laid-off worker in the old Willy Wonka Factory, who was suspected of giving away trade secrets in the old Willy Wonka days. Anyway, it's a weird tour. All the rivers, waterfalls, lakes and any other forms of water are liquid chocolate and the grass, flowers and anything else on the tour is one or another form of edible candy. Weird place. The elevators go up and down or sideways, depending on which way you want to go. The actors are all real (well, the lilleputian-sized people are an animation trick), but the factory, tour and everything else is one of these computer animation jobs, and it's clever and amusing. It's a fun, frivolous movie.

Because of this, one of Charlie's grandfathers lost his job, along with all the other human employees.<br /><br />The second lesson is that of hope and destiny. Charlie, and his parents and all four grandparents live in a run down hut. His hope is to get a golden ticket that would allow him to tour the Chocolate Factory and get the opportunity to get a 'grand prize'.<br /><br />The sets and the music in the movie are really catchy, the Oompa-Loompas (all played by Deep Roy) are really cool...

A very weird portrayal of Wonka. I think Johnny Depp is one of the great actors out there, but I really didn't care for how he played the role of Wonka. Those sunglasses, the pale skin, the smile, it all makes him resemble Michael Jackson in a way. His personality seems low-key and quiet.  No spunk.  In contrast, Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) was much more energetic and enthusiastic.  I realize this 2005 movie follows the book, but I prefer Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka.  Sometimes changing a character's personality in contrast to the book works out for the better.<br /><br />I must say that the blueberry scene in this movie was overdone. It seems that everything was overdone and had lots of CGI.<br /><br />The kids in this movie weren't as memorable as they were in the 1971 movie. Some of them have the really snotty attitude, but not quite reaching the same level as in the 1971 movie.<br /><br />The Oompas weren't nearly as good as they were in the 1971 movie.  The Oompa song from '71 was great.  The songs in this 2005 movie were fair to pretty good at best.

Some of the OopaLoompa songs get kinda annoying and their really tiny then the 70s version and their all played by the same guy. I think this movie put in things what the original didnt, like how did Willy Wonka come upon the OopaLoompa world and it even flashes back to his childhood where he has a strick Dentist father played by none other then the legendary Christopher Lee (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). The cast includes Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket, Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) and Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish, Fight Club) as his parents, David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) as Grampa Joe and Missi Pyle and Violet's Mother. I grew up with the 70's version but I like this one too..I cant choose which one I like so I'll just decide on liking them both equally.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>Taken strictly on its own merits, this film is extremely entertaining.  While Burton clearly revels in special effects & Danny Elfman enjoys flexing his versatile musical muscles, neither of these things gets in the way of a story well-rendered and well-told.  The movie moves briskly to its climax, so much so that the viewer may be surprised at how quickly the time has passed.<br /><br />For those who absolutely ripped this movie because it was not a carbon copy of the 1971 Gene Wilder version --- it isn't a remake, anymore than the assorted versions of "Romeo & Juliet" could be considered remakes of earlier film versions.  It is a reinterpretation of what was already a classic work of fiction, and for my money, it is far superior in staying true to Dahl's vision.  So you miss the Oompa-Loompa song, plus all of the other ditties from 1971?  Too bad --- watch the original if it means that much to you.  Burton's version contains none of these songs, but instead takes the novel approach of relying on Dahl's original lyrics (always crucial in any of his books), so conspicuously absent from the 1971 version. For those critical of Burton's inclusion of a storyline not in the original, it pales in comparison to the numerous 1971 deviations.<br /><br />Certainly Burton's production values absolutely blow the earlier version out of the water, yet they don't seem to get in the way of telling the story.  Too many movies get caught up in the special effects to the point that they tend to bog down a movie that they were intended to enhance.  Burton is able to avoid this trap.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, true to form, nails his performance of an eccentric man-child whose weirdness is obvious yet difficult to pinpoint.  Depp's Wonka makes the adults uncomfortable without being off-putting, yet for all of his innate childishness, is also unable to relate to the assorted brats that cross his path during the tour of the factory.  Depp's Wonka seems to be an interesting amalgam of Ed Wood, JM Barrie & Edward Scissorhands, but remains a strikingly original character despite hints of these earlier roles.<br /><br />Deep Roy absolutely cracked me up in ways that the barely mobile 1971 Oompah-Loompahs never could.  Obviously the advances in technology made it possible for the Oompa-Loompas to be much more versatile in their songs & rountines, and I found them to be consistently entertaining.<br /><br />The various children, in particular those playing Charlie and Veruca Salt, were utterly convincing in their roles.  The boy playing an updated (but all too relevant) version of Mike Teavee makes his character simultaneously fascinating & frightening.  Not enough can be said in praise of the delightful David Kelly (best known from his role in "Waking Ned Devine), who steals virtually every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />It should be noted that this is by no means a childrens' film.  The screening I attended featured an approximately 3-year-old child whimpering in terror as the squirrels dragged Veruca Salt to the garbage chute.  Other children in the audience that were under the age of 10 seemed to respond only to the occasional moments of slapstick involving Willie Wonka and the glass elevator.  Significant portions of the movie will be completely over the heads of most children, no matter what their ages.  Of course, for the adults, there are endless moments of wry humor to appreciate.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.  In time I suspect that the 1971 version will be relegated to the shadows, and Burton's vision will stand alone, unchallenged.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Willy Wonka (Depp) has been in seclusion for years.  One day, it is announced that Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in the wrappers of five million candy bars to be sold around the world.  Those who find the tickets will get a tour of the Wonka candy factory.  One by one, the tickets are found, and the winners are announced...Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee, and finally, Charlie Bucket.  The first four are gluttonous, spoiled, an overachiever, and a TV addict respectively.  Charlie, on the other hand, is just poor.  When the group arrives at the factory, they are all introduced into the the strange world of Willy Wonka.  Willy also tells the kids that one of them will get a special surprise.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka with a creepy intensity.  To say that he is odd would be an understatement, and most of the time he is acting unexpectedly.  The movie itself is a treat for the eyes, as most movies by Tim Burton are.  The chocolate factory is filled with wonders, and run by the Oompa Loompas, all played by actor Deep Roy.  They steal all the scenes that they are in, providing songs about the childrens' misguided actions.<br /><br />I have read that Roald Dahl's family is endorsing it, and can't help but think that most people will like it, especially if they liked the original.  Unfortunately for me, I found the movie only slightly less annoying than the original.  So, while I can say that it is an improvement, I can't say that it did much for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>There is something intrinsically magical about Roald Dahl's book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". The story of Charlie Bucket, a little boy who lives with his dirt poor family in a shack near the famous Wonka Chocolate Factory, Charlie is lucky enough to win one of five golden tickets offered by Willy Wonka for a one-time visit to tour his amazing factory. Each of the other four children is the very embodiment of a problem common to young people; Augustus Gloop is a greedy kid who eats all the candy and chocolate he can get his hands on, Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat who gets everything she wants, Violet Beauregard is a little know-it-all who simply has to be best and Mike Teavee is obsessed with all things television. And then there is Charlie. Charlie is so poor that he doesn't want anything that he doesn't already have, and all he has is the love of his family. Arriving at the factory, the five children and their parents, meet Willy Wonka, the eccentric, strange chocolatier, and their lives will be changed forever.<br /><br />That we all know from the book, which I will venture to put forth, may be the best children's book of all time.<br /><br />Previously made into a film in 1971, "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" stars Gene Wilder as the strange man who lives in a large factory populated by pygmies. The film is well - remembered for its fanciful, day glow renderings of the interior of Wonka's factory, Wilder's tour de force performance and the other elements faithfully recreated from the book.<br /><br />Tim Burton's new film, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", starring Johnny Depp as Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie (both in "Finding Neverland") will also be remembered for it's fanciful, vivid renderings of the interior of Wonka's factory, Depp's tour de force performance (for both good and bad) and all of the other elements faithfully recreated from the book.<br /><br />They sound similar, don't they? Yes. I wouldn't classify "Willy Wonka" as a classic, it's more of a cult classic. And Burton's version is very good, but not great. The major improvement between the two is the improved production design.<br /><br />Depp's performance is good. Wonka is a strange guy and Depp seems to be channeling the spirit of Michael Jackson for the role, which is actually more than a little fitting. Both characters were deprived of a childhood and now spend every moment of their adult lives trying to recapture it. I wonder if Jackson will consider the performance a compliment or an insult. Like Michael Jackson isn't going to see the film?<br /><br />Wonka's bobbed hair, porcelain face which never seems to age and odd clothing give him a slightly effeminate look. Depp uses this as the first step in recreating the role. As Wonka, Depp imbues the character with a childlike sensibility and vocal pattern. As he speaks with his five invited guests, he seems most comfortable when they are acting like children. This also means that he is most comfortable around Charlie, because Charlie hasn't had had the influences the other kids have had. When they aren't acting like kids, he becomes bratty, belligerent and confused.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore is the real standout of the film. He seems to completely get the character of Charlie; despite the odds of finding one of five golden tickets, throughout the world, he still holds out hope. Even as glimmers of hope cross his face, we also see that he realizes the odds are pretty great. All of this is conveyed just through his facial expressions.<br /><br />The other four children are purposely one-dimensional and meant to convey four of the bad traits children can develop if left unchecked. All are portrayed well and serve to make the characters funny and amusing.<br /><br />Charlie's family is the counterpoint to the bad children's parents. Living in a one -room shack that appears it will blow over, the family subsists on a diet of cabbage soup but the important thing is that they have each other's love, which helps them get through. Mom (Helena Bonham Carter, with a dental prosthetic) and Dad (Noah Taylor) care for their parents, all four of which spend every day in one bed. Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) and the other three grandparents provide Charlie with the love and support he needs. All of this helps Charlie become a pretty fantastic kid. He uses the bad toothpaste caps his father brings home from the toothpaste factory to create a replica of Wonka's factory, keeping the dream alive.<br /><br />Once we enter the factory, Burton recreates the journey with vivid colors and designs. The main room they enter, with the chocolate river, is surprisingly similar to the same set in the first film. The addition of more advanced special effects adds another layer to the setting, but really, they are the same.<br /><br />There are a few differences between the two versions. In "Charlie", Burton and screenwriter John August ("Big Fish") have added a back-story for Wonka. This is an interesting and well done touch. Through a series of memories, we see Wonka's childhood with his father (Christopher Lee), a dentist. These moments retain the fable like quality of the book, helping them seem fully integrated, but they also serve to slow down the story. Later, through stories and further memories, we learn about other points in Wonka's life. For instance, how he met the Oompa Loompas (all are played by Deep Roy). These are equally intriguing and well-done. They also seem a little more generic to the story.<br /><br />But are these additions enough to warrant a new film? Not really. "Charlie" is well-made, interesting, and the back story adds another element of depth, but nothing new is done with the core story. For a director with such a vivid imagination, it is disappointing that Burton didn't take it further. Ultimately, "Charlie" seems like a stop gap for Burton, until the next big idea hits him.<br /><br />"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is a very good film, and one of the better films out there for you to take the kids to, but it is ultimately an unnecessary film.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>It was with this movie that I found out that Johnny Depp was such an adept actor.

They get to go inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory by trying to find 5 golden tickets in Wonka Bars. They enter the big gate, escorted each by a parent as they walk closely to the huge factory, the voice on the speaker tells them to come to the big front doors. The door slides open and a cheerful song with dolls and stuff blows into flames...then beside them they hear clapping...they turn as they see Willy Wonka standing there clapping, cheering. Anyway, after this ordeal, he brings them into the factory. He leads them around his crazy chocolate factory where the kids see things...wonderful and strange things. Only Tim Burton can pull this off and who better then to be Willy Wonka then have Johnny Depp (Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Blow) in the drivers seat. It's hard to compare Depp's with Gene Wilder's performance in the 70's because Depp doesnt even touch Wilder's performance, he makes his own and might I say his performance is demented, dimwitted and fun.

There's no knowing where we're rowing. Or which way the river's flowing. Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a blowing?" This is the chant that a deranged-looking Gene Wilder uttered as his magic gondola sailed down the chocolate river in 1971's "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". It is a film that has delighted and spooked children for more than 30 years. And I had the pleasure of going to see this wonderful retelling of the now-named "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" not too long ago. The direction of Tim Burton ("Batman", "Sleepy Hollow") was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Johnny Depp ("Secret Window") as Willy Wonka was top-notch and hilarious! Supporting players include Freddie Highmore ("Finding Neverland") as Charlie Bucket, David Kelly ("Waking Ned Devine"), Helena Bonham Carter ("Fight Club"), Noah Taylor ("Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"), and Christopher Lee ("The Lord of the Rings" trilogy), in which they all gave unforgettable performances!<br /><br />For those who don't know the story, then hop into my gondola, everyone, and I'll tell you a little about a guy named Willy Wonka (Depp). He owns a big candy factory, and nobody's been in it for 15 years. And yet, it's been producing candy all this while. But how, if nobody comes in or out, does the candy get made? Little Charlie Bucket (Highmore) would like to know. He's a poor boy living on the outskirts of the Wonka factory in a strange, dilapidated house where his four ancient grandparents sleep in one large bed (two at the foot and two at the head). One day, after years of silence, Wonka announces to the world that he is putting five "golden tickets" into his delicious Wonka Bars, and the children who get them will be treated to a tour of the Wonka factory and vie for a chance to win a special prize at the end of the visit.<br /><br />Needless to say, Charlie gets one of the tickets, as do a quartet of prepubescent horrors: fat and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled rich kid Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), competitive gum-smacker Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb, "Because of Winn-Dixie"), and the video-game-obsessed brat Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). Wonka doesn't like these kids. He has unique ways of expressing disdain for each. And, in fact, each of the kids leaves the tour early, picked off by their own excesses. (Augustus falls into the chocolate river, Violet becomes a giant blueberry, etc.) We know throughout the movie that Charlie, along with his Grandpa Joe (Kelly), will make it all the way based on his kindness and manners. But what is the special prize?<br /><br />While Charlie is more fleshed out and real than the moppet of the first film, Wonka himself is a bizarre amalgam of Michael Jackson and Oscar Wilde -- only more androgynous than Michael and dandier than Oscar (imagine that!). Whereas Wilder's Willy Wonka was mischievously wise, Depp's is neurotic. He has family issues -- he can't bring himself to say "parent" -- from a troubled childhood with an overbearing dentist father (Lee). Wonka is not merely whimsical here. He is weird.<br /><br />Some may consider Depp's creation a miscalculation. But what kind of person could create a factory of such imagination and craziness and not be somehow crazy and imaginary in the process? The factory is a marvel -- very much like the one of the earlier film at first but more expansive and magical as it goes along. There are special effects now that were undreamt in 1971, and they are put to enchanting use. What exactly Roald Dahl's book and this film promotes in terms of childhood virtues is elusive. Is it moderate appreciation of candy? Respect for imagination? This is unclear. Crystal clear, however, is this: Quibble as you may, besides "Batman Begins", this is the most imaginative and delightful film so far this summer. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. (The Oompa Loompas, Wonka's trusty and diminutive servants, all played by Deep Roy, engage in dazzling production numbers, each themed around the exit of a bratty child. The horn section really soars.)<br /><br />And the chemistry between the strange Wonka and the responsible Charlie is touching and, at times, heartbreaking. This is Burton's most complete and rewarding film in years, especially since "Batman" and "Batman Returns", and certainly in a year full of "Fantastic Four"s and "Bewitched"s, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" succeeds as the most reverential and enjoyable remake. See it, either right now in the theaters or on DVD when it's released!</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is a much darker film adaptation of the Road Dahl novel than "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". Without question, this adaptation is much truer in spirit to the dark, caustic humor of Dahl's prose. I don't exaggerate stating that in Burton, Dahl has found the best artistic kindred spirit capable of rendering his tale into film, while Johnny Depp is a more troubled, emotionally disturbed Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder's exuberant version. And yet, inspite of its often morose, dark spirit, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is deliciously funny, especially in the scenes where Charlie Buckett's (Freddie Highmore) obnoxious young companions get their just desserts (Each time this happens, the film goes into warp speed, offering scenes which are hysterically funny.). As Charlie, Freddie Highmore offers yet another spellbinding performance (He acted alongside Depp in "Finding Neverland", portraying the young boy who was the inspiration for Peter Pan.), portraying the young hero of Dahl's novel as a generous, thoughtful kid who is wiser beyond his years. David Kelly's portrayal of Grandpa Joe is also spellbinding, as the dear old friend and confidant to young Charlie Bucket. Composer Danny Elfman contributes an intriguing musical score which runs the gamut from Philip Glass to the Beatles and Kiss in its musical influences; it may be the most consistently exuberant aspect of this film, along with the lavish sets constructed for the Wonka Chocolate Factory. And speaking of exuberance, there's a silly, but appropriate homage to the opening scenes of Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" which I think is absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed viewing this film, which I would recommend without reservation to any kid above the age of five (However, there may be some scenes, such as the "squirrel attack" which may be disturbing to some younger children.). My only reservation is in Burton's shifting of the tale from Charlie's to Wonka's perspective, adding in a rather gratuitious series of flashbacks with a young Wonka and his dentist father portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lee. This leads unfortunately to a rather extended ending in which Wonka comes to grips finally with maturity (If I write more, I will be yielding a major spoiler!). Still, despite this caveat, I have no doubt that many will find this film most enjoyable.  I couldn't help but laugh at every funny moment, joined by a chorus of enthusiastic film goers each time I've seen "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". It is my favorite film of the summer so far, and one destined to become a future cinematic classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Tim Burton has almost always managed to please me with his directorial turns.  The only film of his that I haven't enjoyed was "Batman Returns," because I felt he took a little too much artistic license on that one.  In "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," we have a twisted children's tale that seems to be tailored to Burton's vision.<br /><br />I'll bet that most folks are more familiar with the Gene Wilder "Wonka" of years past instead of Roald Dahl's wonderful book.  With that in mind, I'll use the Wilder feature for comparison.  First off, Johnny Depp is pretty good as Wonka.  He's somewhat creepy, with a look and tone almost like Michael Jackson.  He doesn't care for families that much, due to his own sick childhood.  In fact, he's more like a grown-up Peter Pan.  He seems to want to live in a fantasy world where he rules with a sugar-coated smile.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is nice.  The kid who plays Charlie has wonderful appeal.  Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregard, and Mike Teavee are also cast very well.  They are brats, and fit this story well.  The only kid I had a problem with was Augustus Gloop.  He almost looked fake.  He had a Wesson-like glow to his skin that made him appear unnatural and disturbing.  The adults were cast pretty good also.<br /><br />The Oompa Loompas were peculiar.  They shared the same face and were much smaller than the ones in the old version of the film.  I did enjoy their musical numbers in this flick more than in the original.<br /><br />The fates of each of the bratty children were well executed, but might scare the little ones.<br /><br />Overall, this is a twisted look at a story that was already twisted.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know how well it will go over with other folks.  For the adults in the audience, it's probably going to be a walk down memory lane.  For children uninitiated, it might be a little bit too different than their modern, politically-correct world where everybody's a winner and nobody's a bad person.<br /><br />Tim Burton is creepy.  I don't think anyone would argue with me on that.  In turn, he makes "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" even creepier.  Recommended for families with older kids(5 and up) since a few of the scenes(especially the demise of Veruca Salt) may come across a little bit too scary for the young'uns.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />Tim Burton, normally one of the most innovative and inspired of modern American filmmakers, comes a cropper with "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," a cold and crass adaptation of the beloved children's story by Roald Dahl.  This is actually the second filming of the work, the first being the charming and delightful 1971 film renamed "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" to give Gene Wilder the title role.<br /><br />In this remake, Johnny Depp takes on the part of the famed chocolate manufacturer who decides to open up his factory to the first five children who find a gold ticket in one of his bars.  Charlie is the sweet-tempered young boy who is the fifth to do so, and, thus, gets to take the tour along with four other obnoxious brats who have none of the purity of spirit he does.<br /><br />"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" fails to make us care about either the situation or the characters.  Depp plays Wonka like a bizarre cross between Michael Jackson and Carol Burnett, and Burton, even with all his attention to detail in the sets and special effects, is unable to distract is from the fact that not a whole lot is really going on in the film.  The early scenes, involving Charlie's eccentric relatives and their attempts to secure the ticket for him, have a warm, familial feel to them, but once the tour itself begins, we become as imprisoned in the claustrophobic setting as the characters themselves.<br /><br />Locked in a tedious monotony, the plot essentially consists of Wonka, the children, and their respective parents moving from room to room where each of the four brats meets up with his or her well-deserved comeuppance in the form of a bizarre factory accident, until only sweet little Charlie is left.  Interspersed throughout are a series of inane song-and-dance sequences a la Busby Berkeley and uninteresting and undramatic flashbacks to Wonka's deprived and unhappy childhood that are somehow supposed to explain why he has become the creepy character we find at the center of the story.<br /><br />The art direction and set decoration are fine but not impressive enough to make us overlook the dullness and unpleasantness of so much of the film.  Mr. Burton may need to go back to making the kind of small, quirky films that he cut his directorial teeth on and leave these empty, bloated big screen extravaganzas to others.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's take on the classic children's tale by Rohald Dahl and an update of the dated 1970's movie starring Gene Wilder.  The movie opens setting up the story.  Charlie Bucket lives with his parents and four grandparents and they are beyond poor.  Their shack in the middle of town is bent and twisted and full of holes.  But they live in happiness and hope and entertain each other with stories of their past.  When news hits town that Willy Wonka is opening his factory to five children via a Golden Ticket, Charlie is hopeful he will get one.  His birthday candy bar doesn't contain one nor does the bar he buys with his grandpa's money.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the four other tickets are found by amusing charachitures of kids with the worst traits:  they are gluttoness, spoiled, selfish and rotten and none appreciate the fact they have a golden ticket.  Charlie finds some money on the ground and buys a candy bar.  Amazingly, this bar has a ticket in it.<br /><br />The five kids show up with one family member each at the factory.  Up to this point, Wonka is a mysterious character, being a part of the story but never being shown.  He makes his appearance after a ghastly puppet show introduces him at the factory.  Wonka, played by Depp, is a quirky, amusing guy with a childhood that haunts him to this day.  Some have likened his appearance to that of Michael Jackson.  That only comes through in spots. Wonka as played by Depp is an amusing unique character.<br /><br />The fun part of the movie begins when the kids enter the factory.  All the parts of the story are there, with each of the four bad kids meeting a temporary demise by giving into the worst of their character.  The candy looks delicious and the factory is beautiful to see.  I think kids will like the movie although my four year old was concerned when Augustus Gloop got sucked up the pipe from the Chocolate River.<br /><br />This movie is cute and fun for kids and adults, yet I don't think I laughed outloud once or came close to sharing any sympathy for Charlie or Willy Wonka.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>This is a wildy visual and funny ride from Tim Burton.  I love Burton films and I love Depp, so I may be just a tad predjudiced, but I had a smile on my face from begining to end.  Depp's Wonka is innocent bordering on malevolent.  He had me in hysterics.  Burton's best work wonders with sets and effects providing a visually beautiful and magical world.  You can still like the original, but it's okay to appreciate this vivid retelling too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>For those of you who are not avid fans of the movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, a little history.  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory featured Gene Wilder as Wonka, an eccentric entrepreneur fond of candy of all stripes. The movie was based on a book for children, titled "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" by Roald Dahl.  The change in the title is telling, as it explains the focus of both the book and the movie.  When the movie came out, it didn't do very well, but has slowly achieved cult status on DVD.  Of course, it was only a matter of time before someone remade it.<br /><br />And that someone is Tim Burton, master of the wacky, whimsical, and macabre.  Having matured somewhat from the days of Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton has begun to imbue his films with more focus.  Big Fish was evidence that something has changed, and Burton is less willing to leave his characters bizarrely and endearingly mysterious.<br /><br />That leads us to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  You might assume that the change in the name means an emphasis once more on Charlie, but that's not really the case.  This movie, while truer to the book that inspired it, is still all about Willy Wonka.  Wonka's story seems a bit dated when you consider the plot: Wonka is an enigmatic and eccentric millionaire who decides to invite five children to tour his chocolate factory.  One of the five children will win something very special.  The rest...well the rest don't deserve it.<br /><br />But as an adult, the film has many other levels.  For example, Charlie's (Freddie Highmore) father, Mr. Bucket (Noah Taylor) puts caps on toothpaste and barely scrapes by at that.  His family is dirt poor; all four of his grandparents sleep in the same bed in the same room, where his mother and father live.  They don't even have a full roof over their heads.  And every day they eat cabbage soup.  Then one day, a robot replaces Charlie's father. And suddenly we realize, Charlie's father is representative of the employees sent reeling by the industrial age, from manual labor in the fields to manual labor in factories...to automation that ultimately makes manual laborers obsolete.<br /><br />Wonka decides to get rid of all the workers after too many of them end up selling his company's secret recipes.  Frustrated by the security breaches, Wonka fires all his workers.  And yet, the work continues.  How?  Wonka journeys to Loompaland, where he recruits the Oompa Loompas.  They all look the same (because they're all the same actor, Deep Roy).  They worship the cocoa bean, making them perfectly suited to working for Wonka. He can even pay them with cocoa alone!<br /><br />Or to put it another way, Wonka outsources his workforce.  They're from a "warm country," industrious, and work for far less pay.<br /><br />The children are all mirrors of different parts of society, and Burton can't resist poking fun at simultaneously updating them and poking fun at modern tropes.  We have the gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), the greedy Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the violent Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry), and the overachieving Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb).  Who isn't concerned about children becoming an Augustus Gloop, in a world of Supersizes where children stay inside all day? Who isn't concerned about spoiling their children rotten like Veruca Salt, where every kid has more than his parents ever dreamed of? What's to keep a Mike Teavee from using his superior, angry intellect that he vents on a videogame on his playmates...with a gun?  And isn't every Violet Beauregarde representative of the all-singing, all-dancing bleach-blonde cheerleaders-in-the-making that their parents trot out for beauty pageants? These children aren't horrible...they are a walking ghoul show of every adult's worst nightmares.<br /><br />It goes without saying that all these children fall victim to their respective sins and are cast out of Wonka's factory.  This sort of blatant retaliation against kids is rare these days, and it's a little shocking to see them get their just desserts.  Each departure is accompanied by an Oompa Loompa song, which went from cutesy Wizard of Oz type dances in the original movie version, to pure MTV/VH1 schlock rock.  I've never imagined Oompa Loompas in a swim routine, retro-80s dance off, acid rock antics, or Weird Al-style video montages.  It's deliriously funny and more than a little confusing at times.<br /><br />Through it all is Wonka himself.  The excellent Johnny Depp plays Wonka as a cross between Walt Disney and Michael Jackson.  This mix makes him alternately creepy and comical; Wonka is not always a sympathetic figure, but then you get the sense that perhaps he's not supposed to be.<br /><br />Wonka's story is fleshed out a bit more to explain who he is and how he came to be such a freak.  Additionally, the ending has been tweaked to leave everyone with a better conscience, which isn't such a bad thing.  However, the film has enough disturbing moments that it's not for young children...whimsy does not mean immature, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely aimed at adults.<br /><br />In summation, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is actually a very basic morality play.  By keeping it simple and yet poking fun at political mores, fads, and icons (even shifting from 50s-style dress to 80s-style music), Burton creates a tale that's alternately funny, heartwarming, and a dire warning for parents everywhere.  Don't let your kids eat too much, spend too much, play too many games, or try too hard to be a winner.<br /><br />With standards like that, perhaps none of us deserve a visit to Wonka's Chocolate Factory.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I loved this movie as a child.  It had a magical aura about it, with all of the crazy creations in the factory and the eccentric and fascinating Mr. Wonka.<br /><br />This version is a good modern-day representation of the movie.  The sets are outstanding and creatively done.  The Oompa Loompas are slightly more disturbing in this version (which may have something to do with the fact that they're all played by a single actor), but they're entertaining.  There is a slight twist in plot in this version, as you get to delve a bit more deeply into Willy Wonka's childhood, but I feel it works within the story.<br /><br />This movie certainly has the Tim Burton stamp on it.  Even if you didn't know he was the director, you would be able to draw similarities between the feel of this movie and his others such as Edward Scissorhands.  It's worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>When it was first announced that director Tim Burton was filming "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", starring the talented Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, concerns were raised that it may not be as good as the original 1971 film "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".  However, when the author of the original book, Roald Dahl (1916-1990), upon which both films were based saw the 1971 film, he was so disgusted that he forced the film's producers to rename it to "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".  Though we will never know today how Roald Dahl would have reacted to the Tim Burton's 2005 version, chances are that Roald Dahl would have been far more pleased with the result.<br /><br />Unlike the 1971 version, the 2005 version both parents of the young Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) are still alive.  His mother Mrs. Bucket (Helena Bonham Carter) and his father Mr. Bucket (Noah Taylor) struggle to support their son, as well as each of the aging parents: Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) who had previously worked at Willy Wonka's factory, Grandma Georgina (Liz Smith, who some viewers may recognize as the character Letitia Cropley from the 1994-1996 British sitcom "The Vicar of Dibley"), Grandpa George (David Morris) and Grandma Josephine (Eileen Essell). Unfortunately, things get worse financially for the Buckets when Mr. Bucket is laid off from the toothpaste factory where he had worked; but the announcement of five golden tickets hidden within five Willy Wonka chocolate bars that will grant the winners to a visit to the mysterious chocolate factory sends the world into a frenzy to find them.  The lucky children that do find them are Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) and his mother Mrs. Gloop (Franziska Troegner); Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) and her mother Mrs. Beauregarde (Missi Pyle); Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and her wealthy father Mr. Salt (James Fox); Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry) and his father Mr. Teevee (Adam Godley); and finally, Charlie Bucket, who is accompanied by Grandpa Joe.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect that separates this film from the original is the exploration of Willy Wonka's childhood (Little Willy is played by Blair Dunlop). His father, the eminent dentist Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee), forbids Little Willy from ever eating any candy or chocolate and forces Little Willy into a maniacal headpiece that prevents Little Willy from closing his mouth so that everyone can see the braces on his teeth.  However, Little Willy, after going trick-or-treating, finds a piece of chocolate that his father had not completely destroyed.  Upon eating it, Little Willy is obsessed with candy and chocolate, which eventually leads to Dr. Wonka abandoning Little Willy.  However, Little Willy has big plans and eventually opens his chocolate factory; but when competitors send spies into his factory, he fires all of his workers and eventually replaces them with the oompa-loompas (with the aid of special effects, each oompa-loompa is played by one actor: Deep Roy).<br /><br />With engaging characters, wonderful songs sung by the oompa-loompas, colorful cinematography, great dialog, superb direction and brilliant acting, I rate the 2005 "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I absolutely loved this movie. It has reminded me why the original film was so special. Even though the original will always be a classic, in some ways, I almost think that this movie surpassed the original. For example, it actually showed more than the original film. In the original "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory", it is only mentioned how the Oompa Loompas came to work in the factory. But in "Charlie", you actually see Wonka go to their home country and find out why they are even working for him. Another interesting thing about this movie is that we get to see into the life of a young Willy Wonka when he was just a child; he has been emotionally scarred by his strict father who never allowed him to eat chocolate or any other candy because his dad was a dentist.<br /><br />The scenery for this film is amazing. From the snow covered city, to the candy room in the factory, it was very beautiful and set the perfect mood for the story. Tim Burton in a recent interview said that it is real chocolate that you see coming down the waterfall, no fake stuff. All in all, it is very wonderful eye candy.<br /><br />As my brother, who was with me mentioned, it was amazing how well the young actors in this film did. Very talented and eerily resembling the actors who were in the original film. The person who was Charlie in the film did an excellent job, and so did the person who played his grandfather. Johnny Depp is the perfect choice for Wonka. Wonka comes off as a big kid and Depp played it brilliantly. He is just what you see on the TV commercials, a very cool character that made the movie even more interesting.<br /><br />The music was very catchy, with each new person that was eliminated from the contest; the Oompa Loompas changed the music entirely for each one. These songs had me tapping my toes at many parts, it has inspired me to go out and buy the soundtrack, and I did. And the classical scores by Danny Elfman were fantastic as well, he is sure to be the next John Williams. His music help set the mood during the opening credits when the chocolate bars are shown being made.<br /><br />Overall, this film is everything I had hoped it would be. This has become my favorite Burton film. The entire time, I can't remember when a smile wasn't literally on my face; it was just like being a kid again watching the original for the first time, even though in some ways the stories are completely different, this movie being closer to the book than the original. This is probably the funniest time I've had in the theater this summer and it was just as enjoyable on the DVD. On a pure enjoyment factor, this movie is tops. What's not to like? It's a feel good movie that touches the inner child in us and leaves you feeling good by the end. If you miss this movie and don't buy it, you are missing something huge.<br /><br />First, when mentioning the special features, I first have to mention the menu screens. Excellently done, each different menu stared Deep Roy as an Oompa Loompa and each screen he is always doing something different. A lot of time was put into just the menu screen; it's nice to know so much care was put into that alone. It was also nice to see Deep Roy do this for us DVD viewers, he is always entertaining.  Now to the special features:<br /><br />Attack of the Squirrels- This is a short making of that shows that these squirrels weren't the easiest actors to work with. It is amazing how much of what we see on the film, not all, was done by real squirrels. We also get a look at the CGI and mechanical squirrels. It's a very interesting look into all of this.<br /><br />The Fantastic Mr. Dahl- This is a touching look at the life of Mr. Roald Dahl, the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory among other novels. This documentary features Dahl's family and friends as their share stories of their lives living with the legend. It also features the family and friends reading excerpts from his various stories. At times, it is very touching to the point tears begin to form. This was a very loving tribute to the author who loved and understood children.<br /><br />Becoming Oompa Loompa- Deep Roy is probably the most talented actor of this film, and this is really shown when you see how much work he put into his performance as an Oompa Loompa. From learning the choreography to having to do the same moves time after time after time, when it's all finished, you find a new appreciation for Deep Roy as an actor.<br /><br />The Five Making of Featurretes- These small mini-documentaries go into detail about how the factory/music and so on was made. My favorite part being how the music was made since this movie has such a brilliant soundtrack.<br /><br />Challenges- These are mini-games that are lots of fun for any age. Oompa-Loompa Dance Machine being my favorite. In this game, you can watch how Deep Roy does the moves for the songs "Augustus Gloop" and "Violet Beauregarde" and you can watch and rewatch the steps to learn how to dance like an Oompa Loompa. Then the second part of the game is that when he is dancing, you can use your remote control and follow his dance moves with the remote. If you mess up, the Oompa Loompa will fall and you have to start over. Once you successfully do one dance, more moves are added and the game becomes more difficult. Real fun!<br /><br />Overall this DVD is excellent! A lot of time was put into it and I couldn't be happier.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I'm a big Tim Burton fan but after seeing the trailers I thought this movie looked stupid. After seeing it though, I think it's one of Burton's best. It's full of strange humor and great visuals. Roger Ebert said he didn't know what Johny Depp was trying to do in this movie as Willy Wonker. Well isn't it obvious what he was trying to do ? He was trying to be strange and unusual and he pulls it off great. He's not gonna be nominated 3 years in row though. As he's not as good as he was in Pirates of the Carribean or Finding Neverland. Gene Wilder's Willy Wonker seemed mysterious and almost sort of magical. This Willy is mysterious as well but looks like he'd eat the children that he doesn't like lol. Still though the movie has a likeable goofy charm to it, as does Depp. So I don't see where he's really a problem.<br /><br />  When the first trailer hit theatres and the internet. Fans of the original were already here writing bad reviews. Saying that the OOMPA LOOMPAs aren't what they should be like. Well they aren't freaky colored midgets. They're what Burton thought they should be like and they steal the show. They're clones of one small strange guy basically. It's great fun everytime they're on screen.<br /><br />  The whole movie is just an odd and darkly funny blast. I also think Danny Elfman does one of his best musical scores next to Batman and BeetleJuice. The flashbacks of Willy's childhood isn't really needed. Well although they are funny in a sick kind of way and Christopher Lee is great as his father. He's a dentist that makes Willy wear a huge thing of braces over his whole face. Of course he won't let him eat candy either and hates candy.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a lot more solid than the last time Burton attempted to do a remake. I could never get into the original and this is easy to get into.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I like the original and I like this remake. Tim Burton is a master at creating fantastic visuals, however he is not as good at telling a story. This is a much better movie than I thought it would be. Depp is great as usual and the DVD transfer is excellent!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />This fusion of two subtly-sadistic auteurs in director Tim Burton and children's novelist Roald Dahl makes for a much better film than I expected when I saw the trailers back in 2005; I don't think it's as good as Gene Wilder's version, but it hits enough different notes that it can be treated as a separate film rather than a remake, and a good film at that.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>This one captures the magic of Dahl's book perfectly.  Any kid would love the imagery. The original "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" has plenty of imagination, but there are moments where it gets overly tedious. For instance, it took way too long to get into the factory itself. Then there were the unnecessary musical interludes ("Cheer Up Charly"? Puh-lease.)<br /><br />In this new iteration, however, you will notice that they get to the factory as soon as possible. There are not even any songs until they finally arrive at the door of the factory. This helps further differentiate the imaginative, fantastical air of the factory from the monotonous drudgery of the "real world". When we first watched it in the theater (I went with my brother, his wife and their [then] two daughters) my brother admitted that he was so surprised that they didn't have a long unnecessary song in the scene where Grandpa Joe gets out of bed for the first time in years. The scene played out better for that simple omission.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy the Gene Wilder version, but this one has a charm and energy that is simply frenetic, while the other one got a bit too caught up in justifying certain aspects of the story-telling.<br /><br />Wonderful movie. Imaginative and colorful. Even the elements that were added to the story (i.e. Willy Wonka's relationship with his father) have a very Roald Dahl feel to them.</p></br><a href="../users/AT7W1EXT0PF2Y.html">AT7W1EXT0PF2Y</a><br/><p>Anyone that's read my Wonka review knows I'm a fan of that movie. Unless you have no sense of humor, take any critique literally, and are immediately offended that is. Being a fan of Wonka, I was made physically ill to find that it had been remade. Remakes are a certain trend in Hollywood made possible by the fact that Hollywood is: 1. Concerned only about money, 2. unwilling to take chances, and 3. now lacking in any talent. I approached the Wonka remake with the same disgust that I have for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Hills have Eyes, and the same way I would approach the remake of Gone with the Wind and Casablanca.<br /><br />We begin this movie with a CG opening because Hollywood is also now obsessed with computer animation. Mainly because it takes out all the work that real animation requires and gives jobs to untalented computer nerds who couldn't draw themselves out of a paper bag.<br /><br />We are then introduced to this film's Charlie Bucket. While the original Charlie was a good looking young chap that was probably pretty cool in real life, this Charlie is a ghastly, mouse-like, gangly, nerd in training, who, in real life, will only know the touch of women who want to "Make it with that kid from the Wonka movie." Upon seeing the interior of Charlie's house I get the inclination that this may not just be a remake of the previous Wonka, but downright plagiarism!<br /><br />Just as things are getting started, we're interrupted with some lame story about Wonka building a chocolate Taj Mahal for some Indian prince. Not only is this story long winded and silly, but it quite frankly is racist. It portrays Indians negatively as dullards that don't realize the chocolate will melt. It makes fun of their culture by a drip of chocolate falling on the prince's forehead, as if it were a tika mark. It then shows melting statues of Ganish and Shiva. Thanks for making fun of Hinduism Tim Burton. This story is but one section of a long flashback sequence, unnecessarily narrated by Grandpa. I could bring up the fact that good movies show instead of tell, but what would be the point?<br /><br />The first act drags on as it shows Wonka bars being shipped all over the world. Why? Everyone that got a ticket was a white European or American. Maybe next time Wonka should avoid putting all the winning bars in the same box.<br /><br />The first winner, of course, is Augustus Gloop. Unlike the original Gloop, this one cannot act, and neither can his parents. This scene is painful to watch. It shows him eating a chocolate bar for a full minute while he reads off some cue card for the voice over. "I...am...eating a chocolate bar...and...I taste something...that does not...taste familiar."<br /><br />The next winner, Veruca Salt, suffers even more so than Gloop. She is gangly, has a horrible put-upon smile, and fails to be the slightest bit intimidating. Her idea of being pushy is yelling, politely, "Where's my golden ticket? I want my golden ticket," certainly a far-cry from the original. (pardon the pun.)<br /><br />Winner #3 is Violet Beauregard, now a violent, bobbed tomboy. She says she gave up gum to find the golden ticket but then immediately claims she's been chewing the same piece of gum for three months. I guess her vice is lying? Winner #4 is Mike Teevee, who's vice, you'd think would be watching too much TV. In this version, it's kid of unclear. I guess he plays too many violent video games.<br /><br />Charlie of course gets the final Golden Ticket, but unlike the original film, Charlie gets the ticket in a candy bar he buys for himself. In the original the ticket was found in the bar he bought for his grandfather, therefore a good deed was rewarded.<br /><br />When the big day comes the kids enter the factory where they are greeted by some stupid singing automatons. Their song is long, uninspired, banal, nasally, and just plain annoying. Then Wonka shows up, unlike Gene Wilder's Wonka, Depp looks like Elton John on a bad day. Wonka's wit, along with the other forced humor in this film is atrociously unfunny, especially when juxtaposed with its original forbearer. Not to mention this newly-lisping Wonka is kind of scary, he's like the Michael Jackson of the candy world if you think of it. I assume they cut the scene where Wonka invites the children to spend the night. He even tells the kids that he's "eatable." This is just sick, Burton.<br /><br />The story is once again interrupted by some 5 minute story about how Wonka found the Oompa Loompas. Once again, the story is highly racist. It involves the Loompas being a jungle people that, "are good workers," and worship cocoa beans.<br /><br />The demise of each of these children is much more horrific and realistic than in the original. While you could chuckle at them before, can you laugh at these kids as they moan and scream in agony? I hope not. Likewise, while the people in the original movie had their faults, they were still likable. There's no redeeming factor in any of them this time, they all come across as axxholes that go around criticizing one another.<br /><br />During Veruca's scene when she tries to take one of Wonka's squirrels he exclaims, "Little girl, don't touch that squirrel's nuts, it'll make him crazy!" I'm not joking, he really says this, maybe Burton forgot he was making a kids movie, or perhaps he's just a moron that could care less about exposing children to sexual metaphors. Go to HeII, Burton. Soon a pack of rabid squirrels fall upon Veruca and attacks her. They gruesomely bite at her in what looks like a scene from Willard, or one of Richard Gear's fantasies, take your pick.<br /><br />Long story short: I wish; this thing just drags on and on. They tack on like an extra 20 minutes after the movie is supposed to be over! And there is this new, stupid, ridiculous ending that ruins the entire meaning and moral of the original. There is no reason to watch this film, trust me. Why eat imitation chocolate when you can have the real thing?</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Maybe better than the original. I liked that they focused on Wonka's childhood throughout the film.  That was something that really added to the storyline.  They really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal, too. I guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original wasn't anywhere to be seen in this one, but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it.<br /><br />Oh, and the children seemed ESPECIALLY bratty this time, which made it better when those bad things happened to them.  A friend pointed out to me that this version has a LOT more musical numbers.  Good call.  I don't know if the ending was better than the original, but it was certainly a very good, interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake.  I don't want to reveal what happens at the end, so let's just say that when the factory tour is over, and Charlie leaves, there's still a decent chunk of storyline left.<br /><br />I was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of "living in a world of chocolate" element wasn't really there, which is definitely a bad thing.  I mean, come on.  We ALL want a world of chocolate!  I just feel there should have been more chocolate-related things included in the film.<br /><br />Overall, it's probably not better than the original, but it's not worse either.  You really need to own both.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Making a remake of 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' could easily be redundant and unnecessary.  Fortunately, with the high-tech wizardry and Johnny Depp's key performance, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a rich, but darker ride.  Some of the same elements are there, and the development of the story is the same, but this time the atmosphere and the ending are much different.  Both versions have musical numbers, and the story is still basically Dante's 'Inferno' for children (with modern vices and punishments, such as excessive gum chewing or too much TV watching).  The choreography is as dazzling as the first film, but the music is updated enough to feature the Ooompah Loompahs performing rap, techno-pop, and heavy metal to deliver us sermons as well as sweeties.  The children's performances are cardboard caricatures in both movies, but Charlie is younger and maybe even more endearing this time around.  Otherwise, the tone of the factory scenes is much more ominous than the classic made nearly thirty-five years ago.<br /><br />The biggest difference is Johnny Depp.  He is deliberately tentative as the quirky and eccentric Willy Wonka.  His performance is admirable and androgenous, but it purposely leaves out a lot of the charm Gene Wilder provided for the role.  This Wonka seems sheltered and clueless. (Some of the flashback scenes tell more of the story, though.)  Charlie Bucket and family, however, make up for the charm deficit and provide some heart-warming surprises.  (Based on the Roald Dahl novel of the current title.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>I went into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with high expectations. Comparisons to the Gene Wilder original aside, Burton had promised a darker movie that was truer to Roald Dahl's classic book. With modern special effects, that sounded like something to experience.<br /><br />The good news is that if you've read the novel, this flick does incorporate many of the elements that the 70s version left out. You get your Indian Prince story, a much grander boat ride down the river of chocolate, and the infamous scene in the nut room. Charlie's father is also back in the story now, and has his job in the toothpaste factory.<br /><br />But then the flick takes some odd turns of its own. The Oompa-Loompa songs use the original lyrics from the novel, but take off in a very garish direction that's neither good nor bad, just...bizzare. Johnny Depp, for all the critical acclaim he's had playing eccentric characters, feels rather forced here. He's distinctive and amusing, but I can't help but feel Gene Wilder was closer to what Dahl envisioned. Finally, the movie tacks on a very sappy subplot about Wonka's dentist father and his parental issues. For all that Burton said about making this movie darker, these parts felt as sugary as the happy ending in the original.<br /><br />I like the Burton version, but oddly enough I still find the 70s original to be a truer interpretation of the whimsical and discomforting world Dahl created. The best effort would probably be a mix of both, and it might be worth another remake 20 more years down the road to see that happen. This deluxe version has some okay extras, but not enough to justify the price tag difference if you see the bare-bones one significantly cheaper. Fans will want both versions for comparisons, families are probably better off investing in the 70s version and saving this one for a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>I watched this movie with the family and found it only mildly entertaining.  Certainly the imagry was wonderful, yet, the story was only okay from my perspective.  Sadly, "just okay" is not something that I ever expect from the talented duo of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.<br /><br />I must confess also that the oompla loompa was pretty creepy and distracted me from the story.<br /><br />A bigger indicator for me {and parents looking for a good family movie} was the overall lack of appreciation and interest from my kids.<br /><br />I give this movie a three stars vote out of respect for Burton and Depp and the effort they put forth, but I think the true mark lies somewhere between two and three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...and I honestly don't get it! This meaning, of course, that I don't understand why the critics didn't seem to come up with worthy enough words to praise this new masterpiece signed a certain Tim Burton. At least the critics over here in Europe did, and after finally watching it (with a mixed expectation being that very often critics have no idea what they are talking about -funny how they mostly agree amongst themselves, isn't it? If a movie is weird enough it's a bit scary being the one who doesn't "get it", am I right?).<br /><br />And yes, this movie is weird enough -but it doesn't seem forced, and is not the problem at all. And I don't give a damn about the similarities between Willie Wonka and Michael Jackson! Ironically at first viewing it was like being served a big and tempting bowl of candy -but it didn't taste anything. The gigantic chocolate-factory stands there in all its' mystery containing all its' secrets, but when we're finally inside every room looks the same. It's been a while since I read the book (but I did recognize myself there from time to time), so my dissapointment has got nothing to do wether it is true to the original story or not -but I simply didn't find it amusing, and after finnishing the bowl I still want candy. Ok, enough with the candy -but how this movie has scored full pot with the critics is beyond me. It's ok at its' best, and I can swallow a child loving it of course -it's colorful, and at times like watching a childrens' show. But at the same time it's a comedy for adults as well, and somehow falls between two chairs.<br /><br />I must admit that my two stars on the other hand goes to Johnny Depp. He certainly "becomes" Willie Wonka, or the oposite that is. He was a pleasure to watch -and overall the movie is saved by good acting from the entire cast. It's the story itself I found flat as its' original script -and far, far overrated. It has its' moments I guess, but nothing remembarable. All the praise of amazing effects, well, I didn't notice anything special. And good and "believable" effects aren't everything (or haven't we learned?).<br /><br />Christopher Lee is wasted on a completely non-fit father/son-scenario switching between present/past (similar to other Burton-productions like "Sleepy Hollow" there with the main character and his mother), and is totally unecassarry -and ruined at least a desent ending. Over the top if you ask me! It just didn't make any sence at all -even for an fabled adventure-story...<br /><br />So sorry, Tim Burton, I'm usually a big fan of you -but you can do better than this!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>As he proves again and again, Tim Burton is one of the more idiosyncratic filmmakers around, directing movies that alternate between remarkable and exasperating. Even with the shadow imposed by the 1971 version with Gene Wilder, Roald Dahl's classic children's story turns out to be the ideal vehicle for Burton's singular talents. Casting his muse, Johnny Depp, as the reclusive, pixilated Willy Wonka turns out to be a masterstroke as Depp is among the most audacious of screen actors constantly upending our expectations on how he plays his roles. Pitching his character as a rather perturbed cross between Mister Rogers and Pee Wee Herman (though the parallels with Michael Jackson are self-evident from the get-go), Depp is far from endearing as he is deliberately disconnected from any reality so he can focus solely on his own childish delights. At the same time, his hubris is what ironically makes him sympathetic as his insulated upbringing has allowed his innate brilliance to give rise to an elaborate confectionary factory.<br /><br />Skillfully adapted by John August, Dahl's tale focuses on a poor, good-hearted boy named Charlie, who lives with his close-knit family in a squalid cottage in a permanent leaning position. The home is just a stone's throw away from Wonka's factory. Wonka decides one day to hold a worldwide contest in which five children will win a guided tour of his factory hidden from the prying eyes of the public all these years. The children are chosen by way of golden tickets hidden in five Wonka chocolate bars, and of course, after much struggle, Charlie is one of the lucky five. Except for Charlie, each child turns out to be a brat, and their accompanying guardians show the reason why. The terrorizing children are gluttonous Augustus Gloop; spoiled Veruca Salt; ultra-competitive Violet Beauregarde; and condescending techno-geek Mike Teavee. Wonka's guided tour is the highlight of the film replete with elaborate sets by Alex McDowell, dazzling cinematography by Philippe Rousselot and what looks to be an army of artists and technicians who have created this wildly imaginative world with a unique sense of panache. Special mention needs to go to Deep Roy, who thanks to digital magic, synchronistically plays all 165 Oompa-Loompas, a herculean effort if ever there was one in film acting.<br /><br />The overdubbed voice of Danny Elfman provides the Oompa-Loompas' vocalizing during the elephantine production numbers, and his genre-spanning music is a total kick. Elfman mimics various pop music styles to define the fates of the selfish children, from the blaring Earth, Wind and Fire-type horns for Violet to the Beach Boys harmonies for Veruca to the Queen overlays for Mike. As skillful as Depp is, Freddie Highmore - reunited with Depp more fruitfully than last year's "Finding Neverland" - provides the emotional focal point of the story with quiet conviction. The story takes a bit of a Freudian leap with the introduction of Wonka's father to explain Willy's oddly alienating behavior, but it all works within the context of the eccentric characters. This one is a genuine delight if not what most would expect from a children's film. The DVD is chock-full of extras with eight different featurettes highlighting various aspects of the production from Elfman's music to Roy's laborious transformation into the Oompa-Loompas, though my favorite is "The Attack of the Squirrels" which follows an army of squirrels through nut-cracking boot camp. Surprisingly, there is no alternate audio commentary track included.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>I'm not a Tim Burton fan but I am a fan to this story. As a child I both read and watched the movie versions although I only had a vague recollection of them going into this film. An excellent group of actors both adult and child wise. The set was colourful and very techno for the time period and the ompaas were hilarious although they might be scary for small children. Depp was an eccentric and somewhat egocentric Wonka but delightful to just look at. Other than Charlie the kids were perfectly deplorable and you can't wait to see what will happen to the next rotten child (no one is killed). I found it entertaining and would watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Willy's back, and of course with Depp and Burton things have changed.  Some for the better and some for the worse, as is often the case.  Oh, and to clarify now, the film is not actually that dark.<br /><br />The plot itself feels a little awry.  For instance, Charlie is treated almost as a sub-character for much of the film, and we are pressed to pay more and more attention to the factory and Willy Wonka himself.  This is particularly true when Burton shows us the newer personal side of Wonka, filled with flashbacks and more.<br /><br />On top of that the whole feel of the musical has diminished, but admittedly they're just not as popular anymore so no surprise.  Oh yes, the Oompaloompas sing, and in quite a  variety of styles too, but don't expect Depp to crack out a note, or the kids.<br /><br />And speaking of Oompaloompas, in the previous versions where obviously a few characters played them, this version has one actor digitally cloned into all of the Oompaloompas.  Not only that, but he is not the most appealing Oompaloompa, as he actually fits the image of a man who I do not think should be around kids.  Oh yes, I definitely loved the musical numbers, and the shrewd comments based around them particularly by the kid characters, but still, scary man.<br /><br />So did I like it?  Yeah, I did, and although I prefer Gene Wilder's version this one gives us another side, perhaps unnecessary side, to this strange yet classic tale of a poor boy and his fortunate and strange trip to the Wonka Chocolate factory.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>Last weekend I went out and saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I've not read the book, nor seen the original, so I had no expectations for the story.<br /><br />This was typical Tim Burton fare: well-directed, with impressive visuals and a great cast. Burton always manages to assemble a great cast, and bring the best out of them. Not that Johnny Depp needs any real coaching to do a good job, mind you. The kid actors are splendid, which was good to see; if they hadn't been capable of doing a good job, this movie would have been toast.<br /><br />As for the storyline...it's a little oddball, and Willy Wonka clearly is calculating and non-personable (though I'mnot sure kids would see it this way)....all the kids who suffer horrible fates are clearly suffering pre-planned fates. Willy Wonka is clearly a character which needs redemption, and he does get it by movie's end, but the achievement of that goal seems a little weakly executed. This is a weak point on my part though, and shouldn't stop folks from enjoying the movie.<br /><br />This is not Tim Burton's best work, but it's still good, and definitely something to take the kids out to see!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>If you grew up watching "Willie Wonka", you may not enjoy this one as much: not as "musical" (at least not as romantic and human, so to speak -no "Imagination" or "Golden Ticket" songs, for example) and certainly not as deep of a message as the one you may take away with the original with Wilder.<br /><br />However, it has its own merits: the kid that plays Charlie is perfect, the movie as a whole comes across as pretty funny, indeed funnier than the original (Depp is able to pull of more laughs, as he was with "Pirates...") and also the effects, as expected, are WAY better! Last, there were some parts of the story that were developed a little more than in the original.<br /><br />As for those who have read about a comparison with Michael Jackson, yes: there's definitely something there. :D<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Its hard to say this is a remake, for Tim Burton has twisted this story into a mind of its own. Johnny Depp is superb as the rather odd chocolate inventor, who's childhood was less then perfect and adult life surrounded by an atmosphere children can only dream of.<br /><br />Yes I say childhood, for Burton has given us a look behind the story of Wonka, his father being a dentist who on one halloween threw all of Willy's precious, gathered candy into a fire. Being afraid of the cavities and other trouble sweets bring. Sound dumb? Not at all. Wonka has in consiquence grown up with a twisted idea of how families are, and has a hard time being around parents, even saying the word is torturous for the candy man.<br /><br />Other than that, this remake has run even closer to the book, Veronica being thrown down the garabge shoot by the squarrels instead of trying to get the goose that laid chocolate eggs. Even the Oompa Loompas have undergone changes, and in turn are hipper, wilder and smaller then before.<br /><br />The landscape is very Tim Burtonesque, in the beginning of the movie, its not hard to guess who's the director (If you already didn't know) For the coloring is dark, and the Buckets house has a decided scrunched look, and tilts to the right in a way only Tim Burton could make it tilt without completely falling.<br /><br />I can't quite say though its a movie to take you're children to. With Willy Wonka licking Bug blood of his Machete, to an Oompa Loompa trying to stab Mike Tv, to dolls catching on fire and dying horrible plastic melting deaths. Other than that, apart from the adult moments and understanding of the film, children might enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? He looked really feminine and mime-like. It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makeup on him! Depp's character had a really awkward and uncomfortable feel (done on purpose but not in a funny way) with bizzare, dead sounding dialogue. The musical numbers were not catchy and there was an odd lack of music through the rest of the movie giving it a really inhuman, unnatural ambiance. I also disliked the one guy playing all the oompa loompas, it looked really fake like a clone attack and did nothing to make the movie more watchable. I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a little kid it's way too dark and scary and has 'humor' that is hard for most people young or old, to understand. I found myself asking, "Was that supposed to be funny?" on multiple occasions. The children (other than Charlie, who is underdeveloped) are really mean and bratty to the point of being unwatchable(as if we need more bad examples for kids!) Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. All the actors in this movie are very talented and it's a shame to see that something about this movie just didn't 'click'. This movie was not really about kids, or fun or candy, it was about Tim Burton falling in love with his own work and failing to realize how lame it was. Tim needs to stick with his own original stories (Corpse Bride for example, was great) and I think it shows a huge ego when someone tries to remake a classic movie like this! It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script is hollow and lousy. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. It has a very cold, lifeless feeling to it and had none of the warmth and joy of the original, almost like someone made a bad parody of WW. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I wasn't entertained in the least and I think this fails as a kids movie and as a grownup movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I wanted to give this 2 stars but there were SOME things I liked about it.<br /><br />This movie has received so much praise since it came out and I'm a little curious about it. Why? Is it because the movies that were made this year were mostly bad and mostly remakes and unoriginal. Probably.<br /><br />The truth is, in my opinion, that the movie is basically the same as the original with a few exception. This one is more true to the book... including the scene about where the Oompa Loompa's came from and how they came to be workers at Wonkas factory and showing more of the Wonka and Charlie relationship after the day long adventure in the chocolate factory. We get to meet Wonka's father and find out why he became so obsessed with candy. This is why I liked the movie.<br /><br />I didn't like the movie because it was the same as the original except longer... with the added scenes. Everything played out the same... like a horror movie... one kid down... two kids down... three kids down... etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />The original Willie Wonka was a classic and Gene Wilder played the character with sadness, madness, wildness, sass, sarcasm and mystery. Johnny Depp didn't really do any of this... maybe sadness and then he added creepiness. I think that was the main thing I missed from the original. You loved Gene Wilder's Wonka because he was funny and sarcastic and quick-witted. Johnny Depp's Wonka was like... well... sort of sarcastic, but creepy and spoke pretty much the exact same way that Depp did in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS... with a mousy squeaky voice.<br /><br />I missed Gene Wilder's sarcastic and unenthusiastic, "oh no. what are we gonna do? How will we ever go on without him?" as Augustus Gloop tried to swim in his river of chocolate.<br /><br />I also missed the Oompa Loompa song. Wow. That song was such a fixture in my memory. "Oompa Loompa... oompadeedoo..." The new songs...??? I couldn't remember them right now if you payed me. Sorry Danny Elfman. You're fantastic... but you can't mess with a classic.<br /><br />Charlie and the Chocolate factory in a lot of ways is better than the original, but the original was so perfect in so many ways... it will always be the better movie to me. Had the original been more fairy tale and included the missing scenes that Charlie and the Chocolate factory included... there would have been no need to remake it...<br /><br />...I got another riddle for you... Why do they remake classics like this... when they can remake one of the many potentially good movies that were a boo hiss?</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>I have been reading so much lately from the critics about their praise for "King Kong". They say it is a movie that made them remember what it is to be a kid again. That it is a movie of pure visual joy. An escapist movie that's main purpose is to please. I think they are over doing it with the hype of that movie, but, if you were to ask me what movie do I think should be described this way, I would respond with, "have you seen "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"?<br /><br /> Here is a movie that is endlessly creative. As I watched the movie I just sat back and relax while this whole new world unfolded before my eyes. I never questioned whether or not what I was seeing was possible or not because it didn't matter. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" creates its own world. A world where anything is possible. Plus that's half the joy in watching a movie like this, or even the "Harry Potter" series. We can visit a place such as this. The world of make believe. That is what the movies are all about.<br /><br /> I've never been much of a fan of Tim Burton's work. I've always found his movies visually creative but too off beat for my taste. I have enjoyed "Ed Wood" and Edward Scissorhands" but everything else has left me cold. "Mars Attacks", "Beetlejuice" and the original "Batman" all have moments of visual splendor but no heart. But in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" I feel Burton has found the perfect blend. This is a movie where Burton can be as werid and creative as he wants because in this setting he can never really go overboard. Plus the movie has heart. He has found the perfect combination. That is why I think this is his best movie.<br /><br /> I've never read the book by Roald Dahl, which this film is based on, so I'm sorry to say I cannot comment on whether or not this movie is faithful or not. But, from what I've read from the critics supposedly this is. I have seen the 1971 film version with Gene Wilder though. I have always thought that movie was a bit creepy. I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid but I remember certain scenes actually being scary. At least to a wimp like me. I have heard though people say this movie is creepy. Roger Ebert complained that Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka reminded him of Michael Jackson. I can sense why someone would say that, but I was never bothered by it. To be honest I was too busy being swept away by the film's visual to really care about his performance. But I never really found it creepy because again, in a movie like this you can never look at anything with a normal eye. The world created here cannot be compared to our normal existence.<br /><br /> If you honestly don't know what the movie is about it follows a young boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who wins a golden ticket when he buys a bar of wonka chocolate. With the golden ticket he, along with four other children, will be able to go inside Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and discover how Wonka's candy is made.<br /><br /> Along the way though strange these start to happen to the children. Each "accident" is of course fitting to each child's personality. One child loves to eat chocolate for example, so of course it is the chocolate that gets him in the end. Another child is spoiled and it is because of her ways she meets her own fate. "She's a bad nut", Charlie says. In this sense I've always thought the movie was a moral parable warnng children not to behave badly. I could be wrong, but that's how I've always interrupted things.<br /><br /> The only thing in the movie I don't like were the songs sung by the Oompa Loompa's (all played by the same person, Deep Roy). To me they weren't as charming or memorable as the ones in the orginal. Though four of the five songs have lyrics written by Dahl.<br /><br /> In the end though this is a minor complaint. The real star of the movie is the visual details that make up this world. Anyone looking for an escape from reality should see this movie. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences I've had this year. Tim Burton hasn't just improved upon the original he has made his best film to date!<br /><br /> Bottom-line: An endlessly creative movie that creates a world where anything is possible. The real star of the movie is the visuals. This is Tim Burton's best movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>Danny Elfman's score begins. I hate Danny Elfman, but of course he would be used, he's in every one of Burton's endeavors. A CGI factory makes CGI chocolate in what seems like a mockery of the same imagery used to make cookies in the beginning of Edward Scissorhands... the narrator starts; in Burton's typical fairy-tale style comes images of fairy-tale times with fairy-tale dilapidated old houses, and I'm really beginning to not like it until...<br /><br />...it all sucks you in. You watch Charlie's family as they anticipate the finders of the Golden Tickets, and their quite acute comments on the nature of the winners. You watch as Charlie simultaneously tries to hide his hope and maintain it at the same time, along with his family's fluctuating eagerness to get a Golden Ticket. And as Charlie finds a ten dollar bill on the ground, you suddenly realize, "Geez, this movie's a lot like the book... well, of course it was one dollar and not ten dollars, but who's really counting?" And a lot like the book it stays, with a few minor deviations which frankly are brilliant. Wonka's flashbacks into his childhood are perfect addendums to Depp's quirky new creation of the beloved character that most could not separate from Wilder, and in the end Wilder's character is still maintained because he is not blaspheme'd. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make a new Willy Wonka that is standalone enough that all thought of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory becomes mere nitpicking by people annoyed by change.<br /><br />In fact, considering the book, Willy Wonka movie, and Charlie movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is truly brilliant. It holds true to the book while still maintaining cinematic appeal by becoming it's own thing. It is not a remake of Willy Wonka, and thank God (or just Burton, as it was his choice anyways, right?) for that, because even though I like the older version, remakes are just incredibly tedious.<br /><br />Special appeal to Burton fans would be the almost demented acting of Johnny Depp... the strange grins when kids get in trouble, the timid voice when he becomes unsure of himself, the reclusive germophobe he makes of a once maudlin and glurgy character. In fact, all the characters are perfectly translated to the screen, even if they do look like porcelain dolls from time to time (I hypothesize this comes from the drawings found in many of Rhoad Dahl's books).<br /><br />Another great aspect of this movie is it's adherence to the musical bits in the book without really being a musical itself. Other than one other song, the Oompa Loompas sing everything, and though their music isn't really that good (I'd like to have it on a CD for laughs, but I don't really care for it otherwise), at least the situations are pretty funny, especially since all of the Oompa Loompas have the same face... and aren't like Munchkins.<br /><br />Another good thing to focus on is the insane amount of allusions.  Did I say "mockery of Edward Scissorhands"?  It's no mockery, the beginning channels that work for a reason.  Kubrick, Hitchcock, and Burton's own films are easy catches, but can you catch all of the homages in this film?<br /><br />As the movie progresses, it deviates more and more from the book, which is fine because it feels at that point like the trust has been salvaged. If people are still worrying about details so far into this movie, then I don't really see how they enjoy very many movies at all. About the time we reach the television room scene, it begins to feel a little tedious but right then wraps up everything pretty nicely (not to say there isn't more good stuff to come, but I'm not going to give away ALL the details). Eventually the credits roll and I'm suddenly realizing, "Wow, that was two hours... felt like two minutes." A sure sign of a pretty good movie if there is one.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Willie Wonka, Willie Wonka,<br /><br />The amazing chocolatier.<br /><br />Willie Wonka, Willie Wonka,<br /><br />Everybody give a cheer.<br /><br />He's modest, clever and so smart<br /><br />He barely can restrain it<br /><br />With so much generosity<br /><br />There is no way to contain it!<br /><br />To contain it,<br /><br />To contain, to contain, to contain!<br /><br />Hooray!<br /><br />For those of us that grew up with "Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" it is hard to approach "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and not start doing the Oompa Loompa song from the former every time the computer cloned Deep Roy shows up in the latter.  I must admit to having not yet read Roald Dahl's original book to include it in the mix as well, and while I am sure that makes a difference to the millions who have, I would not be one of that number (although certainly I am curious as to how this movie will imprint on young children for whom this is their first cinematic trip to the Chocolate Factory).<br /><br />The justification for "remaking" the classic Gene Wilder film is established in the title, which indicates that this time the story is more about Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) than it is about Willie Wonka (Johnny Depp).  That things will be different this time is not do so much that despite the above ditty and the Oompa Loompa's singing commentary on the demises of each of the other children this is not a musical, but that Tim Burton is the director.  As soon as you see the sorry state of the Bucket's shack it is clear this is one of his films, and the Teutonic architecture of the Chocolate Factory and the gardens of earthly delights inside is only more evidence for the inevitable conclusion that Burton is the perfect director for Dahl's story.<br /><br />Actually I liked the parts of this 2005 that took place outside the Chocolate Factory more than the trip inside, which is partially because basically the same things happen to the other kids that happened in the other film (and, I believe I can safely presume, in Dahl's book).  Before the journey inside Charlie's grandparents keep trying to steal all of the scenes inside the shack, but there is something endearing about a poor but happy family (think the Cratchits with another generation thrown into the mix, albeit all in one bed).  However, the best part of the film comes at the end when we go beyond the happy ending of the original film, and not just because it is something different.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore provides the same sort of simple, naturalistic performance he did in "Finding Neverland."  Consequently he makes Charlie a rather ordinary good kid, so that he comes out ahead on his own and not simply by default because the other children are such brats.  I found Johnny Depp's peculiar way of speaking as Willie Wonka to be pretty effective (clearly he is in his own little world) and commiserate with the focus this time around on Charlie rather than the chocolate maker.  As for the idea that Depp's performance is based on Michael Jackson, I have to say that I do not see it.  The pale skin is because Willie Wonka never goes outside into the sun and if such pigmentation was enough to invoke the new man without a country then Burton's "The Corpse Bride" represents Jacko-mania.  Depp's Wonka is a strange little man, who is not particularly endearing, which is exactly what is required for most of the proceedings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>I saw Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night for the first time (I'm behind the times, yes) and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey Tim Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.<br /><br />I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it "reality" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about... It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with "real" sets, "real" Oompas Loompas, "real" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.<br /><br />After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many - the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.<br /><br />Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those "weird" (a word he likes - you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet... So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.<br /><br />Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.<br /><br />What, can I tell you more? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.<br /><br />As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the "family" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the "Edward Scissorhands" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.<br /><br />Thank you, Tim Burton. Thank you very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>Many fans of the 1971 Gene Wilder classic will find themselves picking at similiarities in this re-telling of Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.  Though Tim Buton claimed not to be an admirer of the original, I believe either he or Depp studied up on Wilder's performance.  Closer to the book than the original, there are still certain nuances, certain catch phrases that were not garnered from the book.  Depp's Wonka is a little bit scarier, a little more messed up than the Wilder version.  You get the feeling in places that he and Hannibal Lecter might get along together...Depp is that creepy in places, almost too emotionally damaged.  Overall a stunning Burton vision if there ever was one.  A little predictable...duh?  Is Depp classic here?  Yes.  Is it better than the original?  That's the million dollar question.  Childhood nostalgia clouds the answer for me.  My kids loved it and they love the old one, too.  Score there.  Overall, I enjoyed it tremendously.  Depp's over-the-top performances are always fun to watch.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: The film opens to a montage of chocolate being made within the factory with the trademark Burton style and the trademark Elfman music. First off we must establish that this movie is aimed at the younger crowd, but I think Depp drew in the older crowd which led to the massive box office success. A lot of people compare this vision to the novel, but I like to look at the classic 1971 version of Roald Dahl's novel. The two are very different movies. Mel Stuart's Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was much more subtle and a tad bit mysterious. When we see Tim Burton's version it is much more whimsical, zany, and very loud. Burton opens the film with Charlie living in his crooked house (all to similar to Big Fish) down the road from the massive factory.  In Burton's version we get much more backstory about the character of Willy Wonka, we understand why he closed off his factory and why he went into seclusion and that turns out to be the downfall of the movie in an artistic sense. The movie is very entertaining, and it is laugh out loud at times, but in the end that's all that it is. We lose the idea that this is a satire on the way children are raised in today's society. The Oompa Loompa songs have now become broadway musicals instead of quirky rhymes with a point to be made. At times you can barely understand the lyrics of the songs, and that is where the film's message lies.  Burton presents Wonka as a man who is still just a child inside, who is struggling with his lost childhood and strict father.  In the orginal film the audience never really figured out the character of Willy Wonka, and that is why I prefer Gene Wilder's brilliant performance over Johnny Depp's extravagent wardrobes and make-up.  Gene Wilder had a presence, he had joy watching all those kids fall one at a time because he despised their attitudes as well as their parents. Johnny Depp may as well be one of the kids, it looks as if he is enjoying all the sparks and whistles more than seeing that these kids are learning the reality of things, which is the whole point that I feel is being missed.  I like how Tim Burton makes London covered in a blanket of snow, all white, and absent of any color except for the browns on the houses. The moment the doors open to Wonka's factory we are ambushed not only with color from Wonka's wacky wardrobe, but with a visual feast for the eyes within the factory itself.  The movie closes back outside the wintry white city and the character of Willy Wonka does go through a change. But is that really the character we are focusing on? I thought the children were supposed to learn something, not Willy Wonka? Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka already knew everything the kids did, and that was the reason he tested them with the everlasting gobstopper. This movie throws that idea out completely. All in all, it was a fun ride to be had but it feels just like another product of Hollywood. It lost the magic and heart that the original had, and I think it missed the point that Roald Dahl was trying to make.<br /><br />ACTING: Johnny Depp is great actor, everyone knows that. He adds a wacky spin to Willy Wonka that will remind you all too much of Michael Jackson. He is the star of the movie, I believe the next star is Deep Roy. The little man who was cast as every Oompa Loompa you see on screen. I guess it was an easy job since all he had to do was learn the dances and do them on a green screen, he didn't even have to sing.  All the vocals to the Oompa Loompa songs were provided by Danny Elfman, who also did the singing voice of Jack in Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas. Then we come to the children who I thought were horribly done, all except for Charlie Bucket played by Freddie Highmore. I thought the parents were jokes as well, we see more of the children than the parents and that's a flaw. The original focused on the parents much more because it was the fault of the parents that caused their children to be spoiled.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: It may sound like I hated the movie, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it was funny and entertaining, but I'm just not pleased that movies today are lacking in social commentaries. The original was able to be fun yet still have a very strong commentary. I also liked Gene Wilder's mysterious and menacing Wonka versus Depp's squeaky voiced and pale Wonka. I think A.O Scott of The New York Times hit the nail on the head when he called Tim Burton's Charlie & The Chocolate Factory ". . . wonderous and flawed."</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Tim Burton did an excellent job remaking "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." The film stays pretty close to Roald Dahl's book and the original movie adaptation, although there's this weird thing at the end regarding Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) father and the whole issue of family. Overall, though, I was impressed with this movie. The special effects are excellent, and the children are all hilarious and perfectly cast. (I especially loved watching Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket...that kid is so adorable!) The Oompa-Loompas are spectacular...they were all digitally multiplied and portrayed by the same actor, Deep Roy, who is very funny.<br /><br />Some people have criticized Depp's performance as Wonka, but I think it was brilliant. He really made the role his own by building upon the quirkiness of the character, which resulted in a fresh interpretation of the role that is drastically different from Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka, but not at all bad. I also loved the way that Willy Wonka's skin was the same grayish color of a human cadaver...that's Tim Burton for you! It really added to the overall creepiness of the movie.<br /><br />This is a very good film and is one of the best remakes to come out of Hollywood in some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>This version may be more faithful to Roald Dahl's classic tale, but there wasn't as much life in those everlasting gob stoppers as I would have imagined.  Depp deftly captures Willie Wonka and Burton creates a vivid set of images of the novella, but the movie looked too much like a picture book and failed to create the tension and thrill of the story the way the original version with Gene Wilder did. This movie is amazingly somber and dull, with the characters walking gingerly over the sets, afraid it seems to touch the world Burton has created.  He turns each scene carefully over, like one would do in a pop-out children's book.  The kids are faithful restorations of those in the novel, when Burton could have updated them and given them far more spunk.  Anyway, the film is a visual treat with some fun side stories like Wonka's discovery of the Oompa Loompas.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I walked out of Tim Burton's remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory amused, but unsatisfied, and certainly not how I'd expect to feel after eating one of Mr. Wonka's scrumptdiliumptious treats. Sure, there were moments of crunchy goodness, but most of the experience involved the fancy wrapping.<br /><br />Mr. Burton's hit or miss storytelling (he can be terrific, as in Big Fish, or horrific, as in Planet of the Apes), mainly misses here. But that isn't the worst of it.  The biggest failure of the film is Willy Wonka himself. He is a character of little or no substance, inexplicable and odd for the sake of being inexplicable and odd.  As if in a last ditch effort to give the guy some depth, this hackneyed backstory about his father (who, irony of ironies, was a dentist) was spliced in through flashbacks that might be interesting if they weren't so one-dimensional.  Instead, they do little more than interrupt the flow of the story and set up an anti-climactic ending in which Willy resolves his issues with his father by visiting him.<br /><br />I must confess that I really like the original film version of the story. And it is in contrast to that gem of a film that the weaknesses of Burton's version stand out.  The Charlie of the first movie isn't a uni-dimensional angel (selfless, unflappable, never tempted), and his character is defined by a remarkable ending that offers him more temptation than even the best child ought to be able to resist.  The new Charlie, well, is perfect, start to finish.  Where's the challenge (and character development) in that?  Burton eschewed the important story features (the Slugworth bribe offers) that made the trip through the chocolate factory a rolling moral conundrum.  Burton offers no replacement story device to preserve this important subplot (instead, we get the Wonka backstory). One point of dissonance, though, is the scene in which Charlie finds a ten dollar bill in the snow and, without a second thought, uses it to buy candy. With the set up that Charlie is completely selfless, and that even a thin dime might help his starving, destitute family, his decision to keep and use the money was jarring. What lesson are we to take away from this?  Finders keepers?  (In the original film, Charlie finds a coin in a gutter ... a coin is one thing; a ten dollar bill quite another. Inflation isn't the answer. If Burton had thought about it, he might have had Charlie give the money to the candy store owner to await a claim by the real owner, and perhaps been given a candy bar as a reward.)<br /><br />Wilder's performance was one of depth and substance. Even without a backstory, you come away knowing exactly who Willy Wonka is: an extremely smart, wise, and artistic man who is on a mission to find a truly good kid.  Not a perfect one, mind you (Charlie, after all, stole the Fizzy Lifting Drinks, another episode that doesn't make it to Burton's film), but one of solid, core decency.  Wilder's character's sly comments, his fluency in multiple languages, and his knowing disdain for the creeps who've found his tickets present the picture of a person who ought to be telling us a story of right and wrong, of good kids and bad.  (Burton doesn't even have the sense to realize that it is better that we not know the fate of Charlie's competitors, leaving us to wonder whether they made it or not, and not really caring.  Instead, he leads them out of the factory like a parade of CGI.  Did we need that?  Of course not.)<br /><br />Depp's Wonka doesn't even come close to Wilder's.  He's an empty, Michael Jacksonesque misanthrope without a clue.  He doesn't seem particularly interested in Charlie, or even to recognize what makes Charlie special. They just seem to end up together because everyone else gets taken away. Even at that point, there is no meaningful interaction between them.<br /><br />There were moments of charm and humor in Willy Wonka; a twisted sense of humor infects some good scenes.  But the story is weak, and Willy himself is weaker.  Add to that genuinely uninspired and forgettable songs and dialogue that attempts to "explain" too much, and you have another remake than ought to have stayed unmade.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>Who's idea was it to make Willy Wonka look like Michael Jackson?  Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson, but I'm talking when he was younger and still black.  I also love Johnny Depp, in almost every movie he's been in, but I really feel he was miscast in this movie! Or at least they should have made him look a little more normal.  The movie had good special effects, and decent acting, but overall it was nothing special.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>The original 1971 movie "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is still the best version, especially since author Roald Dahl wrote the script.  Any deviations he made from his book must be okay because he allowed it to happen.<br /><br />In the original, Gene Wilder, captured the eccentricity of Willy Wonka with a bit of warmth and whimsy.  Johnny Depp captured Wonka's eccentricity in typical cooky Tim Burton fashion.  While Wilder's Wonka was no big fan of the four naughty brats, he was never mean to them, even when they learned their lessons the hard way.  The worthy child left standing would make himself known.  Depp's Wonka seemed as if he designed to elminate the ones he didn't like. That just bugged me. A man wanting to keep his vision alive with the right child shouldn't seem so hasty to produce a winner.<br /><br />Another flaw of the new version are the kids that were cast.  One exception is the role of Charlie.  I actually prefer Freddie Highmore.  The brats in the new movie were weaker versions of their original counterparts.  Varuca Salt is my favorite.  She truly was a loud, impatient and indignant spoiled brat.  The newer Varuca Salt didn't seem that bratty at all.  I mean, a band named themselves after her.  They wouldn't do so if she wasn't so memorable.  Even worse were the parents's reactions to their naughty children's mischeviousness.  In the original, the parents actually freaked out as concerned parents would.  In the newer version, the parents just idly watched, mouth agape, barely uttering a word as if they were just going with the flow.<br /><br />Boat scene in the new version:  LAME!  The original was far more memorable. It's the scene we all think of when we you mention "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".<br /><br />Oompa Loompas in the original and their songs...better.  Enough said.<br /><br />Finally, what was the point of the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood?  Completely unncessary.<br /><br />Despite all that, the film exhibited true Tim Burton style and aesthetics. If it was only for those reasons, then the new version would have been a great film.  Otherwise, if you want the dreamy tale of a kid, a chocolatier and his factory, stick to the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>There's a reason that the 1970s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has endured for so long as a beloved classic despite being a box office bomb. The fact of the matter is that the film had a script written by the author of the book, and it had a story that had heart, performances that were memorable, fun songs, deep, well-developed characters, and best of all a fantastic performance by Gene Wilder.  Sure there are parts where it strayed from the book, but in all it stayed as true as possible with the technology available at the time.<br /><br />  This remake by the usually great Tim Burton, and the usually amazing Johnny Depp did not capture the magic of the original. Rather than spending time developing the characters the film seems like it's the classic tale in fast forward. They rush through the finding of the Golden Tickets; there's lack of consumer frenzy that was well portrayed in the original, and it is simply glanced over here. I thought that it was possible that Tim Burton was just eager to show the world the wonders of the chocolate factory, however, where the original took its time getting people acquainted with Willy Wonka, and the factory, and everyone else, the fast forward momentum of the remake doesn't slow once inside the factory, in fact it gets worse. There's still so much of the story that Burton missed out on in his rush to create a hurried popcorn flick with little to no heart. I left the theater wanting to like this movie, but Depp wasn't Wily Wonka, he was a great character, but he wasn't Wonka. Wilder is still Wonka, true to the book, and true to form. Depp's performance came off more like an interpretation of Michael Jackson meets Captain Kangaroo meets Mr. Rogers. Anyone but Wily Wonka.<br /><br /> I also did not appreciate Burton's boasting about how much more like the book this movie would be when only a few things stood out, (though it has been a long time since I read the book) Veruca's disposal at the hands of squirrels rather than Golden Geese, and Charlie's not getting himself into trouble as well. There were other little things too, but all in all, you get the sense that the original wasn't too far off base after all. After all the original was only guilty of the sin of omission, mostly, and what content they added in its place helped make a deeper, more enjoyable story. This one omits things, and adds a very unintuitive back-story for Wonka that is neither necessary, nor does it help the classic tale in any way.<br /><br />Too much time was spent on flash, and not enough on substance. It feels like the film itself has a short attention span, and I walked out of the theater wanting so badly to like this one... I just can't justify it. This was another unnecessary remake, which has done nothing to help the story in any way, or do much else besides create a mildly entertaining visual treat for the audience. It would have been nice to have more depth, and with Burton's track record, it's highly disappointing that it didn't.<br /><br /> In truth you cannot out do the original author's vision for a movie. As a writer myself I can attest that the book version of my stories would be very different from the movie. What works in books don't always work in movies, and I think that Burton's challenge to the original film here doesn't need to be met. This remake is too weak to stand the test of time. Nothing about it is anywhere near as memorable or as enduring as the original Wily Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, nor is it as magical, and heart filled as the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>A lousy, unengaging script. Characters that go nowhere, and/or disappear for great lengths of the film. Trite flashbacks. Bad one-liners...<br /><br />To those who say "it's just supposed to be about nonsense", I respond, that even a film that is supposedly about nonsense needs to have structure and an engaging screenplay to succeed as a film. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory cannot hide behind its overweening fantastical settings; the screenwriter and director are LAAAAZY. Then again, Burton has never been strong on scripts -- look at his Batman films (plot holes ALL over the place) for some perfect examples. It blows me away that a man approaching 50, and a highly respected director, does not understand these things.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition) being an updated version of the 1971 movie with Gene Wilder and stars Johnny Depp in the role as Willy Wonka. The special effects are ofcourse better and the sound is also better. However, the story line differs from the book in many ways as the 1971 version with Wilder does not. The musical numbers of the ompa lompas are also better in the 1971 movie. I love watching the Gene Wilder movie and watch it any time it shows on television. This movie I am not so sure if I have same affection towards. I wish I could give it 2.5/5 but since I can not then I give it a weak 3. 3/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with anything that has to do with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of Willy Wonka prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!<br /><br />The film brings to the screen the story of a young boy whose dream of visiting the Chocolate Factory comes true. There he discovers all sorts of surprises that he never even dreamed existed.<br /><br />The acting is about average, the colors are nice and that's about it.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I would not say that this was one of Burtons best films just because he has made so many great one such as such as "The Nightmare Before Christmas", "Beetlejuice", "Edward Scissorhands", "Batman" ect: but "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is certinaly good, You can tell that it is made by Mr. Burton mostly because the Shapes, colors & Characors have Burton written all over them!, Johnney Depp again delivers a knock out performance as Willie Wonka In what I thought was deserving of the Golden Globe for best performance in a Musical or comedy and a nomination for an oscar! Burton pours his heart into this film trying to make it more like the book rather than the 70's "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".<br /><br />In my opinion this is not as good as the 70's "Willie Wonka" but is quite good none the less, I though that they cut a few good things out and I also have to admitt that I was rather dissapointed with the new "Oompa Loompas"... But the misbehaving children in this one were better than the one's in the 70's!<br /><br />The visuals in this movie were actually great and if you see how much money this movie cost to make you will see why ...

Now it was kinda sorta on my list anyway.  I do like Tim Burton, at least the Tim Burton films that I've seen, and I do like Johnny Depp in most things I've seen him in.  And I read enough Roald Dahl back in the day to know that this would likely be as dark a children's film as you were going to get.  So if it couldn't be said I was desperate to see the film, I was certainly intrigued.<br /><br />Almost as soon as the movie began, I remembered the key reason why it's always a good idea to try to catch Burton's films on the big screen.  The look of them is always impressive--grandiose actually.  And whether you're talking Willy Wonka's factory or Gotham City, you really want the full effect of those visuals.  They remind you of why it's such a shame that the word "awesome" has been cheapened in recent years and now just means something like "really cool."<br /><br />But there's still "awe inspiring" and Burton's visual sense is certainly that.  The initial scenes of Charlie's crooked, dilapidated house and the huge city that surrounds it are as Dahl-esque as you can hope for.  They're almost DALI-esque, in fact.  You almost wonder why such well regarded actors as Helena Bonham Carter, David Kelly and Noah Taylor would be so eager to take roles in a project in which they would be playing second fiddle to the special effects.  For his part, however, it's easy to see why Johnny Depp would be drawn to the Willy Wonka role.  One of our quirkiest actors reteaming with the quirkiest of directors, well, it's almost a sure thing.<br /><br />Depp, we read time and time again, loves to take chances.  I'm sure he and Burton realized that by playing Wonka so affectlessly, they couldn't help but draw the Michael Jackson comparisons.  "Creepy" may be rapidly becoming an overused adjective in describing his performance here, but there you are. It's hard to think of a better one (except maybe "eerie").  If Depp and Burton didn't set out to evoke Jackson, then current events have overtaken their intentions.  But I suspect they did model some of Willy's vocal mannerisms on the Gloved One.  The paleness, the hair-do, and yes, the gloves also evoke Jackson as well. The key question is just how far along in development was this film when the most recent Jackson case broke.<br /><br />The parallels are certainly there.  But there are key differencews. In the world of cinema, someone who lost his childhood,and who has never experienced the warmth of a loving family, can successfully become whole even in his (supposed) adulthood.  In real life, that's not so easy.<br /><br />And there are other key differences between the fictional Wonka and what we know of the real-life Jackson.  Wonka's lack of solicitousness towards children is almost jarring, particularly if you're new to the story.  He does not seem eager to win their affection: in fact, he seems to be almost deliberately alienating. The harm he incurs on them is viewed as being somehow justified.  He is, in some ways, something of an avenging angel, giving these brats and their awful parents a well deserved comeuppance.<br /><br />Interestingly, he is not much warmer towards the deserving Charlie until the very end either.  If he's aware of Charlie's specialness, he is not quick to let on.  It is more likely that h fundamentally misreads Charlie and cannot begin to comprehend the latter's love of family. It all leads to an emotional reawakening on his part, at Charlie's instruction. Child is mentor to the man, as it were.<br /><br />Since I did see the movie at a matinee screening, there were a lot of kids in the audience.  One thing I did not sense was any giddy excitement on their part over what they had seen.  It's only a random sample, to be sure, but I couldn't help but wonder.<br />Is Burton's vision too dark for the kiddies?  Is there any real demographic for this film other than dyed-in-the-wool Tim Burton fans?  I'm not sure.  I had a few queasy moments viewing this film--you know, the sense of having eaten too much ice cream.<br /><br />Or chocolate.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Film purists and hardcore fans were probably apalled that anyone would even think of re-making Willy Wonka. Well, to be perfectly honest, they didn't re-make Willy Wonka. They made Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. I am a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version, but was open to see this one because of who was behind it. Tim Burton and company didn't re-do Gene or anything else. This is more of the story that Roald Dahl wrote. It is no secret that Dahl himself wasn't really happy about the original film. It was different. For those of you out there who have not read the book, this may come as a shock. A shock that this fancy new version that they may deem as an "insult" to the original is actually closer to the actual story. This is why this is not so much a re-make, as much as a new try at the actual story that Dahl wrote. The Indian prince, Wonka crash landing at the Bucket residence, both parents being there, and other things, were all in the book. Not in Wilder's version. Burton is a perfect fit for this movie, and he whisks us away into another gorgeous looking world. The film still manages to evoke the fond memories of the original, and it has that Burton feel of whimsical fantasy like "Edward Scissorhands" and "Big Fish". There is no denying that the movie looks great. The story, as if you didn't already know it and no need to go through it again, puts more emphasis on the Wonka character and his background. The storyline about Wonka's father is new and added on to the movie. It is interesting. How many of you have wondered where this man came from?. Johnny Depp is incredible. He looks funky and speaks in weird tones, but you can't take your eyes off of him. He is quite amazing, and pulls off whatever it is he is trying to do. This is not Wilder's Wonka. This is a whole new conception. The set design and effects are wondrous. No matter how a Burton movie turns out, you know it will look great and be a visionary treat. This one is no exception. Young Freddie Highmore is wonderful as Charlie Bucket. He is a wonderful little young actor, and really brings young Charlie to life. Deep Roy plays all of the Oompa Loompas. That's right. Every single one of them is the same guy. His part is where the only music comes in. This is not a musical in the way the original was. And that's for the best. The other kids are all wonderfully pulled together, and they don't stray too far at all from the original portrayals. One thing I think is missing is the humor. Don't get me wrong, there is hummor here and I chuckled a few times, but it's not the humor like in the original. The original was kind of black, but it's missing here. Bummer. The movie also has a narration, which the original did not. The new narration adds that whimsical fairy tale quality to it. I believe it is Christopher Lee doing the narration. He also pops up in the film as Wonka's never before seen father. "Charlie" is not the greatest thing ever made, but it is a feast for the eyes and for the kids in all of us. I doubt it will take over from the original, but it is well done in it's own right. I didn't find it to be scary at all. Others say it was too scary for kids, or that their kids were scared. I don't see it. I had three kids, all under 7, watch it and were totally enraptured. Burton continues to be a genius, and Depp his muse. I look forward to further pairings. These guys are just magic.</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>I had a very good feeling that Tim Burton was gonna make a great remake of this classic story. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is definitley one of the year's best films.<br /><br />This version of Ronald Dahl's famous story is more closer to the book than the first film based on his book. But, I still love the original film.<br /><br />Both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder play different types of the character Willy Wonka. Depp was more wackier, more comedic and also twisted. Wilder's is more meaner, more saecastic and twisted too. Both actor's did a very good job play Wonka.<br /><br />The Oompa-Loompas in this film were cool, too. But, I still like the original Oompa-Loompas in the original film better.<br /><br />Tim Burton brings out a very cool style of the Chocolate Factory and brilliant visuals.

I liked the original the music was good and yet I liked this one a little bit better.  Gene Wilder was great as Willy Wonka, but Johnny Depp gave a different look at Willy Wonka a more stranger side then Wilder gave us.  Both were great as Willy Wonka but both gave their own versions of him.  Both have alot of differences and some what similar.  Wilder's version of Willy Wonka was more of adult and less stranger whereas Depp's version of Willy Wonka was stranger then Wilder'sand acted more like a little kid and also kind of sounded like Micheal Jackson and a little like Dr. Evil but still was cool.  Of course Tim Burton gives us a little weirder and darker side to his movies.  Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Ed Wood, Beatlejuice, Batman, Batman Returns, Planet of the Apes, etc... they are wierd at times and dark.  But they are all classics.  Except for Edward Scissors Hands I hated that movie.  Missi Pyle is hot.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I remember the first time that I saw a trailer for this; my friend showed it to me on my computer, and it absolutely freaked me out.  It was colorful, it was trippy, and it had a VERY annoying song in the background.  Yet, I still was drawn to it.  For one thing, Tim Burton was directing it, and I have liked most of the Tim Burton movies that I have seen (let's not go into a Planet of the Apes discussion).  And while Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me, Johnny Depp took the role, made it his own, and did a very good job with it.<br /><br />Seeing as how most people already know the ending, I am going to be a little more open with spoilers than I normally am.  Anyway, the choclateer Willy Wonka owns an amazing chocolate factory that churns out some of the best chocolate in the world.  Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy living with his parents (Noal Taylor, Helena Bonham Carter) and his grandparents (David Kelly, Eileen Essell, David Morris, and Liz Smith), most of whom have personalities in this film.  In the original, only Grandpa Joe was fleshed out as a character, but in this version, the only one without a distinct personality is Grandma Josephine (Essell).  Joe (Kelly) is an ex-worker in the factory, George (Morris) is a bit of a cynic, and Georgina (Smith) is a bit senile.  But they are all a very loving family.<br /><br />After years of shutting himself off from the outside world and not allowing anyone to visit his factory due to past spies, Wonka has decided to allow 5 children to visit his factory.  They will be chosen through the use of Golden Tickets; 5 tickets are randomly placed into Wonka Bars going all over the world.  The first 4 children to find them are rich, fat, or have some special means to get the ticket that most children, especially Charlie, don't have.  Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) is an overweight German boy who could (and probably does) eat his weight in chocolate each day.  Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) is an over-spoiled girl whose father (James Fox) gives her whatever her heart desires (and the desire is fleeting; the moment she receives the ticket, without even saying "thank you", she asks for a new pony).  Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) is an overcompetetive gum-chewing champ who feels that if she doesn't win the ticket, she fails.  It doesn't help that her mother (Missi Pyle) encourages the behavior.  Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) is a video-game playing genius (with anger issues) who devises a mathematical formula to track down the ticket.  He only bought one bar (and didn't even eat it because he dislikes the taste of chocolate, which begs the question why he wanted to win a trip to a chocolate factory).  Charlie finds the ticket based on pure luck.  But soon the five children are off to the factory.<br /><br />Once there, they meet the Oompa Loompas (all of them are played by Deep Roy), see fantastic machines and gizmos (such as a waterfall that exists to mix the chocolate), and meet their demise.  Yes, meet their demise.  Each character is done in by their flaws (gluttany, competitiveness, greed, and pride).  And with each loss of a child, Wonka seems almost elated.<br /><br />This movie is a lot truer to its source material than the original (I mean this neither as a compliment or a jab, I am merely stating a fact).  The fact that Charlie's dad is alive, the Indian palace made of chocolate, and the departing view of the other four children after their mishaps (which I was very happy to see) were all in the book, but not the original film.  Although, the fact that the movie explored Wonka's childhood was both a blessing and a curse.  It was very interesting to see where Wonka came from (and it's always great to see Christopher Lee), but the whole point is that we don't know why Wonka is the way he is.<br /><br />This movie definitely won't appeal to everyone, and I can foresee some Wilder vs. Depp fan arguments on the horizon.  But check it out, it's worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Sterile is the one word I would use to sum up Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We never really get to know any of the characters in the story in a deep or meaningful way. In fact, the children are presented so matter of factly that the viewer feels indifference toward their impending plight. Johnny Depp does a decent job as a somewhat dark, disturbed version of Willie Wonka. His quips to the children are funny but in most cases he is guilty of overacting. The best parts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory are the flashbacks to Charlie's childhood. Here we learn about his father, Wilbur Wonka (played to perfection by Christopher Lee)  who is a dentist with an extreme dislike for any type of candy. The viewer also glimpses how Willie Wonka met and recruited the Oompa Loompa's to come and work in his factory which is an interesting side bar. I don't know, call me nostalgic but this version couldn't hold a candle to the original. Gene Wilder was absolute perfection and although Depp handles the role, this is clearly not one of his shining screen moments. I can relate to  Tim Burton's vision but to me there's just not enough heart in this one to make it a winner. Recommended(Barely).</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>I was really dissappointed in this movie.  I think the original was far better.  Granted this version did a better job following the book, but the whole movie just seemed to be off.  Maybe it is just Tim Burton and all of his weirdness, but this is not a movie I'll be watching again any time soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I was pleased to have this "Willy Wonka" re-make meet my expectations....and then some. Those expectations were high, at least in the visuals department. I expected a wild, colorful ride with brilliant hues and good special effects...and I was not disappointed with this DVD.<br /><br />It was inventively fun with those great visuals and another wonderful kid playing "Charlie." I doubted they could ever come up with another child as appealing and nice/wholesome as one in "Willy Wonka" but they found one in Freddie Highmore. He filled the bill magnificently, as did the "brat" kids.<br /><br />A different feature of this version, as opposed to the 1970 original, was that here the Oompa-Loompas were all played by just one person, a very small Indian man named Deep Roy. One of the interesting "features" on the DVD details how difficult that was to do and how much time Roy had to put in to do all the things he did.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, meanwhile, "did" what he always does - do a good job of playing a weird person. I get the feeling he relates easily to strange characters. He seems to play enough of them.<br /><br />Since it has 35 years of technology and computer work knowledge that the original wasn't able to have, this re-make is stunning on DVD. And, since "entertainment" is what the business is called, and this movie is extremely entertaining, then I have no complaints. It's a fun two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>This was a great movie. The cast did a great job!!!! Especially, Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore and David Kelly as Grandpa Joe. They were just great. Tim Burton did a stunning job as director. He made the Chocolate Factory into a fantastic place. This was a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TD7B0CT1NHO4.html">A3TD7B0CT1NHO4</a><br/><p>To be fair - this is not Gene Wilder's Wonka character, nor should it be confused with Wilder.  Neither should it be measured against that earlier version, and I've seen the Wilder version many times.  This is a very interesting film, and to the credit of Johnny Depp, he makes it his own.  There are some different twists to the movie and other reviewers have highlighted them, and this review will only share that it was an enjoyable film, with an upbeat score, and some twists on the plot.  Charlie still has his Grampa Joe, and his background as a former worker in the Chocolate Factory added some different drama to the film.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little off the beaten path, but with some entertaining characters and music, you may want to check this film out.  Recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>The film is delicious, and I don't even like chocolate.<br /><br />I brought some baggage along, since I suffered through that 70s (I think) Disneyed (I think) version in my childhood. Gawd, did that ever suck. Roald Dahl, meanwhile, is an author I spent a bit of time enjoying a few years ago. What he wrote for adults is brilliant. What he wrote for children is brilliant. He never talks down to anybody, which is part of his brilliance. Plus his way with words, plus the fact that I think he was absolutely nuts. In a good way, okay?<br /><br />As I watched this DVD, I saw a few bits that were modernized. Otherwise, it was impossible to tell which bits were Dahl and which were Tim Burton. And nobody cares. Nor should they. Tim Burton was born to turn a Roald Dahl masterpiece into a film. The spirit of the Dahl story, which I haven't read, was undoubtedly here. Damn, this movie is so much fun. I hate that my DVD (from China, not Amazon) has bad spots, meaning I had to skip a couple of segments. I'll find another copy, though, and watch it again. This is an instant classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I personally was siked about seeing this movie.  I couldn't wait, because as a kid I loved watching the original with Gene Wilder.  So I drug my wife who wasn't so thrilled and her kid-brother to the movies.  I personally loved this movie, beggining to end.  I thought that it was beautifully shot, complettly draws you into each frame, and although I had read numerous reviews that mentioned Depps performance to be 'over the top' and very 'jackson-ish' I thought he was perfect.  He really made the film enjoyable.  He may have been a little creepy and or corny at times, but thats what made it so great.  Johnny Depp is one of those great entertainers, like Crowe, who is never the same.  They completly morph into a charactor and thats what Depp did here.  Another rising star is young Freddie Highmore who played Charlie.  He is the next Haley-Joel Osmand I guerenty it.  Maybe this time the kid won't dissapear after he hits puberty.  Anyways, the movie was a refreshing taste of holliwood, a great little escape into the weird and yet complete fun.  Tim Burton will get an oscar nod I'm almost sure of it, and for that he deserves it as well as little Highmore...be nice to see him get recognition as well.  Anyways...see this movie..you will be pleased, I promise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I loved the book when I was young, but never really got into the sequel, about the glass elevator. I don't ever remember watching the original with Gene Wilder - but then I don't remember ever watching the original Oliver, but I used to have it taped off the TV, so I guess I must have watched it at some point. It's probably the same for the original.<br /><br />Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Christopher Walken, Nicolas Cage, Will Smith, Brad Pitt, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Michael Keaton were all considered for the role of Willy Wonka. Marilyn Manson also badly wanted the part. I could quite imagine Marilyn Manson in the part actually, but there's something not quite right about Johnny Depp in this. I dunno what it was. Maybe it was because he's not in the least bit attractive in this (you'd have to be of a sick mind to find THAT attractive), or maybe it just didn't work. Tim Burton & Johnny Depp made a pretty good team in other movies, but just not in this one. I think they failed.<br /><br />Also, there was way too many special effects. Not something you would normally complain about, but basically, Tim used every effect in the book. And it's just too glossy in the end. The Oompa-Loompas are very weird also, and the songs were slightly nauseating.<br /><br />However, I did like Freddie Highmore in this - hopefully he won't turn out to be a precocious child actor. I also liked the fact we got a brief glimpse into Willy Wonka's childhood, and how he came to be the master of chocolate. It was quite interesting, but the brace was a little freaky - but apparently, that was taken from Tim's childhood.<br /><br />Also, I loved how the grandparents were brought to life, all those years ago when I first read the book. They were exactly how I imagined them, and it was fabulous.<br /><br />I think the glass elevator was incorporated into this, simply so there wouldn't be a sequel. I'm hoping so anyway, but as I say, I can't remember much of the sequel, because I couldn't get into it. Some of the buttons on the glass elevator say: Incompetent Fools; T-Bone Steak Jell-O; Secretarial Poodles; Cocoa Cats; Mechanical Clouds; Stars in their Pies; Nice Plums; Up And Out; Fragile Egos; Black Box of Frogs; Weird Lollipops; Mighty Jam Monitor; Creative Dog Flip; Elastic Forest; Leaky Canes; Dessert Island; People Poo; Pie Cream; Spewed Vegetables; Naffy Taffy; Lickety Split Peas; Honeycombs and Brushes and Old Sneezes and Smells Dept.<br /><br />It was very faithful to the book, although I think, if I can remember correctly (it has been quite a few years), the ending is a little bit different, as that bit was all new to me.<br /><br />I'm still not sure about Johnny's portrayal of Willy Wonka, it's quite disturbing actually. But I won't let that distract me from an alright film. It was nothing special really, and the OTT special effects, could have been toned down.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Having gone through his horrendous PLANET OF THE APES re-thinking / re-imagining / re-whatever, I had forgotten how good a film-maker Tim Burton can be. This is a pretty good film full of magical moments but marred by Johnny Depp's disastrous-Michael Jackson-like-performance.<br /><br />Here's a tip to Tim Burton, the world is full of actors, next time at least consider the possibility that Johnny Depp might be miscast for a part.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Well, I love the original version.  I watched the new version of the film and then re-watched the old one and the old one was so much better.  The child actors played the parts especially better than the children in the new version of the movie.  The new one is just over-the-top and seems to force computer technology in our faces to make up for the lame acting.  If you loved the original, this will be fun to watch and compare, but you will find yourself being loyal to the old version. Worth a rent, but that's it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>As I was watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, it occurred to me that this review would basically conclude that this version of the movie adds absolutely nothing to the old version, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder and Jack Albertson.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the plot, Willy Wonka runs a Chocolate Factory, but no one has been allowed inside with him for years.  He distributes 5 golden tickets randomly in shipments of chocolate bars.  The children who find the tickets will win a tour of the factory.  Young charlie is one of the lucky kids, from a very poor home, who finds a golden ticket.  The tour commences and the kids - each with one adult family member - see strange and wondrous things inside the candy factory.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is probably the best actor available for the role, almost ideal, some would say - but not better, for this particular role of Willy Wonka, than Wilder.  Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers of movie scores, especially Tim Burton movies, but in this case his music is actually worse than in the old film.  And the dancing rock numbers of the Oompa Loompa's is horrendous.  The old film was in color, had decent art direction and special effects, fine acting, and both films follow essentially the same plot, with minor variations, not much funnier in the new film.  Plus they left out the "Candy Man" song, one of my favorite parts of the old version. And so I would have given the film only 3 stars, for it's almost as good as the original, though unnecessary since it's not better, and then one less star because I missed "The Candy Man."<br /><br />But then the end came, and then they DID add more in this version, and it's good - morally and emotionally satisfying - and it involves Christopher Lee.  So I'm giving it 4 stars and recommend it for the whole family and everybody.  And the old version as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I've never really been a big fan of the Willy Wonka story, finding the original nothing more than an overblown musical misfire.  However, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp give so much life and "weirdness" to the Roald Dahl classic that I found myself hopelessly involved in this morality tale of greed and excess.  Although Depp is reminiscent of Michael Jackson with his pasty white face and effeminate demeanor, he infuses Willy with a dark side, which the screenwriters explain by showing us his repressed childhood (with a nice turn from Christopher Lee as his dentist father).  Add the gorgeous set pieces, the absurdly entertaining musical numbers by Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas and Depp's delightfully warped performance, and you have one strange and enjoyable movie.  The child actors are wonderful, especially Freddie Highmore as the titular Charlie and WINN DIXIE'S Annasophia Robb as the bubble gum chewing Violet.  David Kelly as grandpa and Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor as Charlie's parents are great too.  The musical score by Burton stalwart Danny Elfman is delightful; Elfman even does the singing for the Oompa Loompa songs with lyrics by the book's author, Dahl.  With no slant on Gene Wilder's original Willy, I found this movie much more enjoyable and visually stunning.</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>I wanted to be original in this review and not talk about the classic Gene Wilder version, but I find it impossible.  Having been a big fan of that film, yet having not read the book, and being a huge fan of each member of the trio named in this review title, here are my thoughts on how this much-discussed project turned out.<br /><br />It's a very funny film, first of all.  There are a great number of hilarious moments, lots of laughing out loud for all ages.  And the moral that was clear in Wilder's version is clear again:  Wicked children suffer the consequences of their actions and hopefully learn and grow, while goodness is rewarded in one way or another.<br /><br />And for my money, the music is leaps and bounds better in this "rethink" version, with Elfman's score sounding more like his old Oingo Boingo sound than anything he's ever put on film.  Having been a Boingo fan myself for about a quarter century, that's saying something.  "The Candy Man" always seemed out of place to me, the only part of the Wilder film that had to be endured rather than enjoyed (other than the out-of-place super-sappy ending); Elfman has taken the lyrics that Roald Dahl wrote in his book and added his singular quirky pop-rock sensibility to them.<br /><br />This brings me to the Oompa Loompas.  Modern technology has made it possible to duplicate Deep Roy, a Kenyan actor of Indian heritage who has worked with Burton several times before, into 165 six-inch-high Oompa Loompas.  Instead of merely carbon-copying him, however, a la "Lord Of the Rings" and "Troy" battle scenes where a few dozen actors are duplicated into thousands, multiple takes were used to convincing effect as if we were really seeing many tiny Oompa Loompas instead of Xeroxed Deep Roys.  The result is as clever as anything Burton has ever put on film, a solid improvement over the little people in the earlier film.  Roy reportedly earned a cool million for his role(s), nice work if you can get it.<br /><br />But the heart of the comparison between the Depp Wonka and the Wilder Wonka is, of course, between Depp and Wilder.  While there's no doubt that Depp is a more versatile actor, Wilder's portrayal of the chocolatier is one of moviedom's greatest offbeat characters.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Depp's interpretation has come out at the same time that Michael Jackson has been such a subject of fascination, as many have drawn parallels.  I think that in a few years audiences will see this without the Jackson comparisons and be much fairer in their assessment of Depp's work here.  Depp's Wonka is the personifcation of stunted development, single-minded antisocial obsession, and paranoid as well, without being nearly as creepy as some have stated.  I find him no creepier than Wilder's Wonka, and no scarier....in fact, less so.  He's a big kid whose genius has allowed him to not grow up, and whose childhood was really ugly.<br /><br />Thus we can see that there is a valid psychological comparison between Jackson and Depp's Wonka, but it's unfair and unwarranted to overdo this comparison; it's just a current popular culture touchstone with which some reviewers have pigeonholed Depp's version.  This will wear off over time.  Personally Depp's Wonka seems to me more like an immensely more harmless version of Malcolm McDowell's Alex from "A Clockwork Orange," at least visually; turn Alex's clothing style black and you have Depp as Wonka in "A Clockwork Chocolate."<br /><br />There is one criticism I can agree with.  The repeated flashbacks to Wonka's childhood, as the son of an obsessive dentist, are really distracting.  We spend the first half-hour of the film being told what a wondrous place Wonka's factory must be, being teased into wanting to see it ourselves, then once we get there we are constantly drawn back out to Wonka's childhood.  It's really unnecessary; more restraint in revealing Wonka's upbringing would have resulted in a smoother story and more satisfying experience.  One reason Burton went this way was that he could work with Christopher Lee in the role of Dr. Wonka.  Having been a huge fan of '50s and '60s horror films when he was young, this is big to Burton; see Vincent Price's role in "Edward Scissorhands" for a much more effective fulfillment of Burton's wishes to work with such actors.<br /><br />Ultimately "Charlie And the Chocolate Factory" is an improvement over the original in a couple of ways (special effects, which is no surprise due to technological advancements; the music; the ending; and, marginally, the acting talents of the children), is the equal of the original in some ways (the set decoration, the wonders of the factory, Charlie's love of family), but inferior in some ways (primarily the flashbacks).  I prefer the original, but this newer model is well deserving of a place on my list of 200 favorite films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>Not a family film in anyway.  This film is just weird, scary and not really entertaining.  Why film makers of now-a-days think that they can outdo something as wonderful as the original production is way beyond me.  I was not impressed, if anything the film was extremely distorting.  I should have realized that Tim Burton does not have a grip on reality anyway.  Hollywood gets more weird each day and i believe that i will be staying away from Hollywood/american entertainment of film making.  No wonder less and less people are viewing american films.  It seems that whatever is produced in Hollywood should stay in Hollywood.  It would be a blessing if someday the state of California just breaks off and falls into the ocean.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>One thing you can always count on when you get a Tim Burton film is that it'll look visually great. Art direction and production design is always top-notch(except for Planet of the Apes where only the costumes looked good). However, some of them seem to be lacking. Planet of the Apes was boring half the time and had an incredibly stupid ending. Sleepy Hollow looked great but it had a dumb storyline and dialogue choices. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looked great but halfway through I was wondering if there was a point to the craziness.<br /><br />The most famous chocolate factory in the world is run by reclusive Willy Wonka. One day he announces something surprising: 5 tickets will be inside random chocolate bars. The children who find them gets a tour of the factory. It's been used as a parody for the Slurm Factory in Futurama and the Pawtucket Brewery in Family Guy. This leads them into the factory only each kid ends up receiving a little misfortune until the last one gets something great.<br /><br />One watches the film and is wowed by the sets and the effects used. If you're into this kind of thing, you'll sure find it inventive. My favorite is the Nut Sorting Room where a group of heavily-trained squirrels end up sorting different nuts and putting them in chutes. Another has Oompa-Loompas(a dimnuitive race Willy hired to work the factory) firing fireworks just for the hell of it.<br /><br />One problem I had with the film is how basic everything is. Each kid is your typical one-note persona: the spoiled rich girl, the know-it-all punk, the fat boy and so on. And of course Charlie's soooo good and noble we just know he's going to win the big prize by default. Their fates are actually never dealt with once they come out of the factory. It's like "okay kid, you're a blue flexible kid, have fun" without even returning them to normal. And more than once I asked myself if there's even a plot. 5 kids tour a factory and gets a little snafu. That's it.<br /><br />In terms of the look, it's easily one of Tim Burton's most colorful but as a film it's way down there.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the second time Tim Burton approaches Roald Dahl's creations, but it is his first time as a director.  Despite being the first time, as a director, there is something strikingly similar between Burton and Dahl if one looks away from the fact that one is a filmmaker and the other an author, and it is their unique way of telling a tale.  Dahl's many stories are mysterious, clever, and have valuable lessons, as do Burton's films.  Both storytellers convey moral lessons for any individual regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity.  This time Burton directs Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with the full approval of Felicity, Dahl's widow, and he captures the same puzzling world that Dahl once created through a grand adventure containing sweets and moral lessons.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore plays the main character, Charlie Bucket, a boy from a poverty stricken family where the parents nurture all four bedridden grandparents.  Charlie is polite, honorable, and noble, qualities that he most likely has acquired from his loving parents and guiding grandparents.  Nothing seems to touch the family, as they always see the glass as half full.  The Bucket family recognizes that money, possessions, and power do not grant them happiness.  The only thing that makes them truly happy is the love that they have for each other. It is announced to the world that Willy Wonka, the refined and enigmatic chocolatier, will invite five children that find five golden tickets to his factory.  These golden tickets can be found in his chocolate bars and they will provide entrance to his secretive chocolate factory to which no human has entered for years.  When Charlie hears about this he cannot help but dream of entering the factory up the street, and his birthday is just around the corner, which means that he will get a Wonka chocolate bar.<br /><br />In the meantime, Charlie and the folks in the small and raggedy Bucket residence will learn about who and how others have gained access to Wonka's chocolate factory.  Each of the lucky ticket winners brings up different notions of disrespectfulness, which further seems to stem from the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth.  These children are obvious in their character, as they might overtly express two or three of the deadly sins.  However, a younger audience will most likely not recognize the seven deadly sins, but it is nonetheless clear that these ticket winners are rude and have very bad manners.  The film even goes as far as openly suggesting the source, poor parenting.<br /><br />After an extensive introduction of the other characters, which is essential, as the film deals with what is right and wrong in the light of the consequences of being good, or bad, comes the biggest surprise, or maybe not as Charlie discovers the fifth and final ticket.  Together with Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) Charlie gladly leads into the legendary chocolate factory, as the other four children walk ahead of their parents into an adventure that will separate the good from the bad.  It is here, a good chunk into the film, where Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) appears for the first time.<br /><br />Willy Wonka displays an overtly bizarre appearance with a large white smile and eccentric mannerisms that continue throughout the film.  Depp does an extraordinary job in bringing out an aloof and awkward character that frequently seems to drift off to some unknown time and place while standing among his newly arrived guests.  Those viewers who have seen Depp in other films will not identify this character from any of his previous performances.  It is also clear that Burton and Depp have a special relationship, as this is their fourth film and soon the public can see their fifth upcoming puppet film, Corpse Bride (2005).  Depp simply elevates the story far beyond mediocrity into the bizarre fantasy world where Burton seems to be most comfortable where the audience can relinquish it's thoughts completely to the filmmakers performances and storytelling.<br /><br />In 1971 Mel Stuart made Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory based on the same book, which for many has gained a status close to immortality in the world of cinema history.  Despite the notion of remaking an already good film, Burton forcefully delivers his version of the story with the help of a tremendous cast and spectacular cinematography that delivers a fantastic tale.  The film succeeds in reaching the level of the previous film from 1971 and with ease passes the former film based on Dahl's story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  This film should certainly gain a nod in the Oscars for the best writing and screenplay based on material previously produced or published.  Burton's film grasps the issues in an easily understandable manner which can be understood by both young and old, which does not leave anyone behind.  Yet, Burton leaves a little extra for the adult audience to ponder while also considering the youth by offering them several thoughtful lessons.  In the end, Burton's film delivers a tale that Dahl would have approved of, as it has all the genuine tangibles of both storytellers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's remaking of "Charlie in the Chocolate Factory" is mediocore at best. The special effects are decent, but Depp is the real problem here. His Willy Wonka is NOT an improvement on Gene Wilder's, and he doesnt really bring anything that special to the character or the film.<br /><br />If anything, he looks to young to play the part and comes off as rather creepy. And Burton's Oompa Loompas are a joke.<br /><br />Kids may enjoy it, but as a "remake" that improves on the original, this film fails.<br /><br />Overall, the movie looks beautiful but the original 1973 version is much better and more "magical". I did however thoroughly enjoy the "squirrel scene". That was the best part of the movie in this reviewers opinion.<br /><br />Average movie that's worth a one time viewing (whereas the original can be watched repeatedly and still manages to entertain)<br /><br />Recommened for kids only. Adults should stick to the original.</p></br></body></html>

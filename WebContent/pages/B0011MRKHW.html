Something I have not done in a very long time. The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!<br /><br />To all those who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the Elizabeth: The Golden Age, prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church & their allies in the Spanish government had the armada succeeded in its mission.<br /><br />If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of  the dictator Franco!!<br /><br />Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line. Something this brilliant film makes crystal clear, regardless if Queen Elizabeth was no saint!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>A holy war has been declared against England's Protestant Queen Elizabeth (Blanchett) by the Pope.  Leading the charge is Spain's King Philip II, who wants to replace her with Quenn Mary of Scotland (Morton), a Catholic who is imprisoned.  On the home front, Elizabeth is being pressured to marry by her advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).  She rejects many possible husbands, but finds some interest in Sir Walter Raleigh (Owen).<br /><br />"The Golden Age" is an entertaining but flawed movie.  On the positive side, it is great to look at.  The costumes, set design, and cinematography are gorgeous.  The acting, while not as standout as in the first movie, is still impressive, especially by Cate Blanchett.  On the negative side of things, the story isn't that exciting.  Historical fact is also compromised for cinematic value, but not much is added.  The war with Spain comes and goes quickly, and without much excitement.  "The Golden Age" is an adequate sequel, but by no means surpasses the original.  It is worth checking out though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>I'm not sure why this film has been so maligned. I have not seen the first film "Elizabeth" with Cate Blanchett and this director, so I cannot compare the two. I can confirm that watching the blu-ray of "Elizabeth:The Golden Age" is a beautiful experience. Blanchett is stunning as the queen and the range of her queenly and womanly emotions during a very tricky historical time is very impressive. The costumes are heavenly, the sets outrageously detailed and beautiful, and the Craig Armstrong score is lush and memorable. While some argue, and rightly so, that the film is historically inaccurate, I disregard those complaints and sit back and enjoy a very good film that takes me back to the time period in question. I'm very glad that this is part of my collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>At once more ambitious and less intriguing than its predecessor, Elizabeth: The Golden Age certainly isn't the abject disaster reviewers claimed on its theatrical release, although it's not nearly as engrossing as the original. Unfortunately, while Shekhar Kapur opens up the action and opts for a much lighter palate this time round, with at least a trailer's worth of striking visuals, the results are not particularly compelling. By focusing on the best-known part of the Virgin Queen's reign there's less of the constant sense of danger that marked its predecessor even though it amps up the threat by pitting her not against her own court but the might of the Spanish Empire and its Armada. Yet, being a sequel, it adheres to the `the same but different,' and there's certainly a strong element of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu: the dastardly Catholics are still plotting her death, with Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton taking on the Daniel Craig and Fanny Ardant roles of Jesuit hitman and conspiring Scottish queen. And, as before, history isn't well served, with the film offering the notion that Philip of Spain conspired to force Elizabeth to execute Mary Queen of Scots to give him an excuse for a holy war.<br /><br />The script certainly could have been better, running down rather than gaining momentum as the Armada approaches and dropping the ball in many of the obvious slamdunks. Certainly if you're going to omit Elizabeth's famous "I may have the body of a weak and foolish woman, but I have the heart of a king" you need to come up with something with more guts and bravado than the tired horseback speech she gives to rally her troops. Even worse, the Armada itself is something of an anti-climax. The almost painting-like CGi effects aren't as much a problem in a film as occasionally stylised as this as are the all-too obvious budget limitations that reduce it to the odd running commentary that makes it somewhat akin to listening to a football game on the radio.<br /><br />Performances are highly variable. Blanchett is suitably regal in the lead, with Geoffrey Rush and David Threlfall fare best among the courtiers, but Abbie Cornish makes little impression, Rhys Ifans just seems to be going through the motions and Samantha Morton is fairly awful as Mary. Both bland and risibly hammy at the same time, with her risibly overemphatic delivery she feels like a smug prefect in a school play playing up to the gallery rather than a credible conspiring monarch, giving easily the worst performance in the film even after the worst of her performance hit the cutting room floor. Yet the biggest surprise in the film is Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh.<br /><br />If at first it seems disastrous casting the zombie-like Owen as the representation of the life and love Elizabeth can never have, but, amazingly, for once he almost rises to the occasion. Like many a bad actor he's utterly hopeless in the moments that aren't about him, looking bored when he's supposed to be listening, displaying complete disinterest in his scenes with Abbie Cornish and sleepwalking through the battle with the Armada, but for once he handles his monologues - the best writing in the film - surprisingly well, even changing his expression a few times, though quite why he chooses to play his early scenes with a bad American accent remains a mystery. It's not a perfect performance (the deleted scenes on the DVD show that his flat delivery and lack of timing botched a gift of a scene with Rush), but for the first time there are signs that if he was willing to really put in the work and had a director who wouldn't mistake talking in a bored Coventry accent for a performance he could be a capable jobbing supporting actor.<br /><br />The 1.85:1 widescreen transfer is a bit disappointingly short on detail in some scenes, though there are a decent set of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Others have covered the details sufficiently, so I will stick to a simple review.  This sequel was one of those rare films that was as good as the original in every aspect.  When a sequel is this good, it doesn't have to rehash the first film, it can just get on with the story telling.  Fine work, a worthy watch, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>While this sequel to the 1998 film Elizabeth pales in comparision, it still finds some nice moments in a film that seems more content on the film more as a work of moving art, with its lavish costumes, gorgeous sets, and stunning cinematography, and yet human development somehow gets lost beyond all the pretty pictures and lovely costumes.<br /><br />Elizabeth's reign as queen is once again in peril. King Philip of Spain plans on Holy War against England and the protestant queen that rules it and plots of assaisination begin to form under the control of Mary Queen of Scots. All the while, Elizabeth finds her heart once again caught in the battle, as she takes notice of a dashing pirate, Sir Walter Reiligh.<br /><br />What's the film suffers is its seemingly vacant story line and the near absent soapy drama that made the first film so entertaining to watch. the director has all this great history to go upon and yet he seems more intent on the look of the film then the actual feel of it. As for Geoffry Rush, his character is reduced to nothing more but a side note that does not carry the same effect as he did in the first film.<br /><br />But the good thing is that on aspect of the first film did not change and that would be Cate Blanchett's performence. Still just as fierce as in the first film, she brings back all of the aspects of our Queen that we knew and love. With a bitting wit, steely determination, and the ability to show weakness at just the right moment, Blanchett is able infuse just enough life into a film that, without, would probally be entierly dead.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2007's "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" picks up the story of Queen Elizabeth in 1585.  The young and uncertain woman who became Queen in "Elizabeth" is now the mature and confident icon of her people.  Cate Blanchett reprises her role as Elizabeth.<br /><br />Director Shekhar Kapur sets three plot threads in motion at the beginning of "The Golden Age."  The first is Elizabeth's life at court, as she manages her counselors, a simmering rivalry between Protestants and Catholics, and proposals of marriage from a variety of foreign suitors. The lonely Elizabeth dotes on young "Bess" Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), a young, attractive and trusted lady in waiting.  Enter Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), handsome swashbuckling seadog and explorer, who widens Elizabeth's horizons with tales of a new world and bewitches her heart with his charm.<br /><br />The second thread is the plotting of disgruntled Catholics against the Protestant Elizabeth.  Elizabeth's aging spymaster Walsingham (nicely reprised by Geoffrey Rush) seeks to guard her against assassination.  Her Catholic cousin and rival Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), is imprisoned in England but schemes with English and Spanish agents against Elizabeth.<br /><br />The third thread is the threat posed by Philip II, King of Spain.  As defender of the Catholic faith, Philip intends to depose Elizabeth and is gathering a mighty naval armada and army for that purpose.<br /><br />These three plot threads are linked, sometimes in surprising ways, and they will come together to threaten Elizabeth's hold on the throne.  The savage interrogation of an arrested Catholic plotter uncovers the Spanish threat to England, while driving Bess Throckmorton into the arms of Walter Raleigh.  A failed plot against Elizabeth's life ensnares Mary Stuart, leaving Elizabeth with an agonizing choice of punishment.  Philip's armada enters the English Channel and Elizabeth must rally England's tiny navy and army to face an invasion.<br /><br />Ultimately, this becomes too many moving parts to manage gracefully.  Director Kapur handles the triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh, and Bess Throckmorton with delicate precision to a reasonably satisfying conclusion.  However, he chooses to interpret Mary Stuart's involvement in an assassination plot to suggest that the whole was a scheme of Philip to justify going to war (a more common interpretation is that the canny Walsingham gave Mary Stuart enough rope to hang herself).  The battle with the Spanish Armada is a series of melodramatic visuals laden with religious overtones that must have been close to incomprensible to American audiences unfamiliar with English history.  Philip, in real life an outstanding chief executive of a far-flung empire, is reduced to caricature as a gnome-like fanatic muttering threats in candle-lit royal chapels.<br /><br />"Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is a visually stunning treat, taking full advantage of lavish sets and costumes to present a sense of place and time.  The underlying theme of the original "Elizabeth" movie is reinforced with a vengeance, as Elizabeth must sacrifice her personal desires to rule and safeguard England as an iconic mother figure.  A strong cast helps carry the day.  This movie is recommended as solid entertainment to fans of costume drama and period pieces.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>I wanted to see this film when it was in the theatres, but it seemed it was gone in the blink of an eye. Having watched this long-awaited DVD, I can see why it had a short run.<br /><br />I loved the prequel, "Elizabeth", and had eagerly looked forward to this sequel. Upon viewing it, I was a tad disappointed.  It totally omits a pivotal character, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, the man who was Elizabeth's confidante and played a vital role in the events of the day. Instead, the screenplay chooses to focus on a supposed romance between Sir Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth, which plays itself out against the backdrop of a serious threat of war with Spain. Unfortunately, this supposed romance simply does not ring true, striking a false note, and therein lies the rub. The screenplay was poorly written, and the film came across as choppy and poorly edited. Consequently, unless one is familiar with the historical events of the day, the viewer might find the plot confusing. On the plus side, the costumes, the sets, and, above all, the acting were magnificent.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, as always, is terrific as Elizabeth, although she looked like a woman in her thirties rather than one supposedly in her fifties, which has a somewhat jarring effect. Geoffrey Rush is once again excellent in the role of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spymaster. Clyde Owen makes for a very virile and dashing Sir Walter Raleigh, while Abbie Cornish is delightful as Elizabeth "Bess" Throckmorton, the Queen's lady-in-waiting and Raleigh's true love.<br /><br />While I love period films, I would recommend that one rent, rather than buy, this DVD.  Although I enjoyed the film, somewhat, I was torn between awarding it three or four stars. In the end, however, the crappy script overwhelmed the efforts of its stellar cast. I only hope that if there is to be another sequel that the script rises to the level of the talented cast. Unfortunately, here it does not.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Through out most of my lifetime Elizabeth II has reigned in England as a constitutional monarch. The first Elizabeth was another kind of monarch:<br />she was one of the last mostly beneficial absolute monarchs. The wrongs<br />of this system gave rise to a long period of civil strife after this period<br />in which royalists and protestants republicans fought it out.<br />She executed a number of Catholic conspirators in this film<br />as the result of a Papal ban on her father's Church of England.<br />In one view by defying the Spanish and the Pope, she established the British Empire in the world.<br />In another view she was the one who made more peace than war<br />and spent a lot of time building an army and navy for defense purposes.<br />Time has told and she was one of the greatest, best English absolute monarch and<br />makes the King George of the American Revolution look very bad?<br />The problem here is : do we believe this version of the biography or not?</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>Shekhar Kapur picks where he left off in telling  the story of Elizabeth Tudor in 1998 by presenting his interpretation of the latter half of the Great Gloriana's reign in this 2007 sequel.<br />  It begins in 1585. Elizabeth has been England's ruler for over a quarter century, and is now 52.<br /> She deals with threats of  invasion by Spanish King Phillip II(Jordi Molla), her ex-half-brother-in-law, and plots  against her that are a little closer to home by Scottish Queen Mary Stuart(Samantha Morton), her Catholic cousin, whose legitimate claim to the English throne is supported by Spain and Rome, but who arguably overplays her hand in dealing with her cousin.<br /> Meeting with her council members, her chief advisor Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush)advises her to monitor England's Catholic population more closely. While omitting her famous line, "I will not make a window on men's and women's souls", the Queen's(onscreen) actions reveal this. She vows to punish her people only based only on their deeds, not their beliefs (which in reality, didn't happen).<br /> The story omits  the Queen's most trusted advisor, William Cecil, as well as Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Cecil, and Robert Devereaux, and focuses on her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh (the ruggedly handsome Clive Owen, with radiant charisma, but looking as though he stepped from the canvas of an oil painting), who has just returned from the New World, having named the colony of Virginia in honor of the Virgin Queen, with the bounty of the New World, a few Native Americans, and pirated treasure from Spanish ships in tow.<br /> One has to overlook many historical inaccuracies to enjoy the performances of the beautifully intelligent Abbie Cornish as the Queen's ward, and most-favored lady-in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, Christian Brassington as the Archduke of Austria ( whose appearance recounts an episode of the storied Queen's life that took place earlier than the 1580s), David Threfall as Royal Astrologer, John Dee, whose prediction  of a war between two Empires, and vaguary surrounding those details troubles Elizabeth, Eddie Redmayne, as Anthony Babington, the Jesuit's recruit to assassinate the English Queen, Rhys Ifans as co-conspirator and envoy to Spain, Robert Reston, and Adam Godley as Francis Walsingham's traitorous brother, William.<br /> We are led through sundry intrigues, and court rituals, as well as the Queen's dramatic response to a threat by a Spanish Ambassador in which she claims to have  an internal "hurricane that can strip Spain bare", before we come to the high drama surrounding the trial and execution of Mary Stuart, an incident which causes Elizabeth much distress and may well have made her re-live the similar scenario involving her own mother, although she may have been too young to remember the latter.Tom Hollander's Sir Amyas Paulet, presides over the Scottish Queen's demise.<br />  Under the observant eye of his  daughter, the Infanta Isabel (who was actually 21 in 1588, but here is portrayed by child actress Aimee King, decked out like a 16th century Wednesday Addams),a vengeful King Phillip, who supported Mary Stuart, declares Holy War on England.Elizabeth has to forgive Raleigh's seduction of Bess to appoint him as captain of her naval forces.<br /> The climax of the film is the dramatic confrontation of the Spanish Armada, where Henry VIII's once unwelcome daughter presides over an astonishing victory. The cinematography of this scene is particularly bold.<br /> Dealing with life and death matters among her closest subjects shortly thereafter, she settles into her role as mother of her people, and helps England close the 16th century on a golden note.<br /> The acting and the costumes are superb, and I have often felt the best historical dramas are ones that resemble moving oil paintings of the time they depict on canvas. Director Kapur succeeds in creating that effect here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>Our fascination with British history continues as we watched the gorgeous sequel to Elizabeth I, "The Golden Years." Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called "The Virgin Queen" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.<br /><br />Elizabeth I, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, is more moderate than her father. The movie continues to create great suspense as we learn more about the latter years of her reign. Her loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, continues to help the monarch to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and Elizabeth is able to check mate all attempts against her.<br /><br />The extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur added amazing detail to provide authenticity as to the battle between England and Spain, and they build a ship that is half Armada, half British, then PC replicated, providing awesome battle scenes. The architecture and decorations of the time are exquisite, filming where construction is actually taking place, and dressing in period clothing all construction workers, so the reality is magnificent.<br /><br />In this film we see a monarch that is now experienced but confronting great challenges because her Catholic cousin, Mary Stuart is after her throne and upon her death, Spain sees the opportunity to attack England under the disguise that she has executed an anointed queen. We see the relationship the queen has with Sir Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen, who brings unique gifts from the new discovered lands of Virginia, named in honor of the Queen. His masterful knowledge of the seas provides great insight to Elizabeth during the defeat of the Spanish Armada.<br /><br />One of the most spectacular scenes is where the Queen is on her horse, encouraging the people of England to fight to death if necessary to keep England free from foreign domination.  As with the first installment, Elizabeth is simply superb, don't miss seeing this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>The first hours of ETGA was thrilling. Elizabeth (the ever-awesome Cate Blanchett) reigns with confidence and charm. She is held in fearful esteem by her people, whom she swears to protect. But treachery is afoot, in the lingering presence of Catholics in England after the Reformation, and Elizabeth worries about the intentions of her captive cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. Meanwhile, Elizabeth plays a teasing game with suitors from around Europe, each hoping to make her his queen. Enter the dashing and roguish Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) fresh from his discovery of Virginia, named for his beloved virgin queen. Raleigh charms his way into Elizabeth's court, and encounters a monarch who is vulnerable in spite of her adamantine exterior. All of this plays out against the threat from Spanish King Philip, busy building a fleet of ships to recapture England for the Church and to depose the "illegitimate" Elizabeth.<br /><br />As I said, the first half of the film was wonderful -- well-written, clever, visually stunning. The costumes were gorgeous, intricate and convincing. The acting was subtle and believable. It was touching to see Elizabeth grappling with husbandless middle age. But close to the halfway mark, the film founders and never recovers. Inexplicably, Raleigh (who heretofore had the hots for the queen herself) falls for one of her courtesans. This injects a silly "forbidden love" element into the film. After this, the movie ricochets from one movie clich&eacute; to another. Elizabeth, uncovering a plot by her cousin to take the throne, is disconsolate at the thought of executing a God-appointed queen. This in spite of her father's unstated lack of scruples in beheading E's mother, Anne Boleyn. Philip sets Jesuit plots into spin and launches the Spanish Armada against England. With odds overwhelmingly favoring Spain, will Elizabeth let her darling Raleigh out of prison to take on the Spanish? Will she regain the composure needed to lead her besieged people to victory? Will the manly Raleigh manage to get off his burning ship on time? By the time the movie ended, I really did not care. I no longer believed the character's motivations and lost hope that the movie's loose threads (OK, was E OK with Catholics or bent on hunting them down?) would be tidied up. Having abandoned any hope that the filmmakers would be able to dramatize the panoply of events, the film settles for set pieces. Elizabeth is seen in her flowing nightie, gazing out to sea at the burning enemy ships -- which are clearly visible one moment and enshrouded by fierce storms the next. Symbolic scenes (e.g., the one in which E, perfectly-coiffed and costumed, is circled dizzyingly by the camera) alternate confusingly with literal scenes full of extras. Reconciled with her status as mother of her country, she blesses the child of a couple who should have suffered her regal wrath for having ignored the need for her permission to marry.<br /><br />"Elizabeth, The Golden Age" had so much going for it. But by trying to tell so many tales at once, it managed to tell none of them well. A disappointment to all but the most ardent Blanchett and Owen fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Following up 1998's Elizabeth, which documented the virgin queen's early years and rise to power, director Shekar Kapur delivers The Golden Age, an exploration of her character. While Elizabeth (Blanchett) is busy deflecting unsuitable suitors and falling for the dashing Walter Raleigh (Owen), imprisoned cousin Mary (Morton) plans her assassination with the backing of Spain's devout Catholic king, Phillip II (Jordi Molla), who has promised to rid England of Protestants. The first half of the film has a lot going for it: lavish, detailed and not as stiff as your usual period dramas, The Golden Age allows the love story to take precedence and the subtle wooing between the Queen and Raleigh boasts a few cracking put-downs. Blanchett, arguably the best actress of her generation, knows how to play Elizabeth and has fun with the character, while Owen et al just about match her. It's obvious that Kapur wanted to devote more time to the Spanish invasion, but time or money trimmed the battle back to such an extent that the grandiose Armada lacks any real significance - both visually and story-wise. A story of two halves, The Golden Age works better as a love story than a political conspiracy.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>If you enjoy great acting performances, stunning direction and cinematography and more (sets, costumes, etc.) you should be entertained for most of the two hours. The story was pretty interesting, too.<br /><br />It's tough to beat a foursome like Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen and Samantha Morton for good acting but - for me,  the star of the film was the photographer. In this case it is Remi Adefarasin. Between his camera-work, the direction of Shekhar Kapur, and the production design by Guy Dyas, this film is a series of pure visual treats.<br /><br />I'm not one who usually pays much attention to costuming but Queen Elizabeth's attire in this movie is spectacular. A nod to the great costume design efforts of Alexandra Byrne.<br /><br />Some people complain Elizabeth isn't portrayed as a strong-enough woman in this movie. I'll use a British response for that: "rubbish." Not only is she strong, she is shown as human - not some cold-blooded machine, but as someone with feelings like the rest of us. All her emotions - and I mean all - are on display along with inspiring leadership of her country, with the latter's welfare her number one priority.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Set in 1585 when Spain is at war with England, suffering their worst military defeat in its history.

After watching The Golden Age however, I was utterly distraught. I cannot believe that this is made by the same man who directed the first film. It just doesn't seem possible.<br />Everything from the script, to the editing to the actors that don't belong, it just doesn't work or flow. If there is one redeaming aspect of this film, it is the once again brilliant performance by Cate Blanchette. She can do no wrong. She is one of the most skilled actresses out there, anywhere. However, my gripe is actually with her character. She doesn't even seem to be the same Queen from the first Elizabeth. Granted, years have passed, but this Elizabeth comes off as weak and undecided, jittery even. It doesn't feel right. Abbie Cornish also feels very wrong as the Queen's favorite lady-in-waiting. She is very out of place, no matter the beautiful costume she is wearing.<br /><br />Samantha Morton as Mary Stewart is UTTERLY wasted. They could have just cast some unknown, so small and barely noticable a part she played. One of my favorite actors, Geoffry Rush was shamefully placed in the background and barely had anything to do with this film. His character was a favorite of mine in the first film.<br />Clive Owen is pointless in this. His character feels neither here nor there. Wrong choice in actors, I guess.<br /><br />The plot was also confusing, it jumped around way too much and you never really know how much time has passed. There is no mystery or intrigue. Nothing to captivate. The final and supposedly huge battle is a few boring minutes long and feels almost out of place.<br /><br />The costumes and wigs are magnificent, as in the first film.  Again, one of the only bright spots.<br /><br />This is an extrememly dissapointing film that probably should not have been made. It seems very unnecessary. This is definitely one of the instances where a sequel is so much worse than the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>I had hoped for much better in this.

Very tiresome.<br /><br />Plus, seeing the Queen of England riding around the battlefield in plate armor like some kind of Joan of Arc was just a little too much to swollow...<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I looked forward to seeing this sequel to the 1998 release but somehow despite the great production values and Cate Blanchett's great performance in the lead role, I was disappointed. Most of the problem concerns the script which seems to lack focus.  First we are treated to Elizabeth's problems with Mary Stuart, then her relationshop with Walter Raleigh (an excellent Clive Owen) and then the struggle with Prince Phillip of Spain to maintain diplomacy which culminates in war. In comparison to the original, there was a distinct point of view but in this sequel, everything is scattered with a lack of focus. The 3 stars I give this to are the superb HD DVD transfer, Blanchette's performance and of course the battle scenes.  This is disc you would need to show off the virtues of HI-DEF!! If you like this type of history, do check it out but there are better films on this subject such as "Elizabeth and Essex" and "The Virgin Queen".</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>First the table is set for us. England is in trouble. Spain rules supreme with a vastly superior navy, The Spanish Armada. Phillip of Spain in a fanatical despot. A Catholic obcessed with destroying Elizabeth, the "bastard queen" who is by the way, Protestant. That alone didn't set her apart. It was her williness to allow her subjects to worship as they wished, a very radical notion at the time. By 1585, Elizabeth is middle-aged & probably not going to marry or have an heir. But she is still a woman & Sir Walter Raleigh comes into her life. He is a privateer, an adventerer, good-looking & cool as hell. He entertains her with stories of the new world which he has visited, claimed & named for her... Virginia. She falls for him & commands he stay. He tires of court life & desires to return to sea. Eventually, he takes up with Elizabeth's favorite Lady-in-waiting, Bess. Sir Walter impregnates & marries her, in that order, apparently. This of course enrages the Queen. Soon however there are more important things to deal with. She had been forced by her advisors to execute her cousin(?) Mary, Queen of Scots,  a Catholic claiming she is the rightful queen. The Spanish Armada is coming with troops to invade England. Elizabeth, looking very butch in her armour,<br />addreses her troops who are to defend England. But they don't have to.<br />Shortly, a storm intervenes, destroying the Armada & Phillip's dreams.<br />  The tone of this movie was somewhat lighter than the first. Just the ligther colors & sprit conveyed the idea that Elizabeth had coosolidated her power, which was absolute. Perhaps the best years of her reign. If you like history, you'll  appreciate this effort. However accurate it is much of it is historical fact. Considering we are looking back over 400 years it is really excellent. Forget that it is history, if you must. It is still a pretty good story.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I dont know, I just didnt feel this movie, I liked the first one, but in this one Blanchette is a real Bit#h, and it gets old.  Clive Owen is game as Sir Walter, but he and Blanchette dont really have much chemistry, and his supposed chivilry sort of falls flat.  One thing is constant in both of the Elizabeth films and that is that Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as Walsingham, he is riviting everytime he enters the frame.  This is beautiful film to look at, the imagery is amazing, the cinematographer is fantastic, it's the pacing that is the problem, at times it felt like a history lesson and the scene toward the end were Elizabeth has her requisite Braveheart moment, I wanted to laugh, it just totally fell flat.  Overall, im not sure id recommend this movie, but if you liked the first one, you might be cool with this one, and I understand they are making a third installment, so I suppose you would have to watch it, in order to understand the context of the third film.  Pretty film, but not really a good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>it's good movie and you won't upset to seen. Also it's touching and proud.<br />The Elizabeth Story was historical and learning from old war. I like the sound of music. You will enjoy the movie until the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>This was one movie I really hope that it will be impressive but as it turned out, it proves to be a really lousy movie. Cate Blanchett proves to be superb but she can't save a sinking ship like this movie.<br /><br />I am not going to get into details about the historical accuracy since like the first Elizabeth, this is more like a historical fantasy closer to the Lord of the Rings then history of Britain. But I would say this, the director really sucks and whoever wrote the script needs to be taken out and flog, and finally, who did the editing in this movie should not have any children of their own. Simply put, these three elements of the movie failed the paying customers badly.<br /><br />This movie appears to be a visual feast without a coherent story. We have poor Cate doing a lot of standing still, a lot close-up in her great costumes and a lot of staring. And yes, it quite visually fantastic and it would even be more if there was a developing script to all this. The movie appears to be over-edited as the plot move from scene to scene, each scene almost independent from other scenes. What you get as a result is a movie that don't make a lot of sense and where characters do things that don't flow with other scenes.<br /><br />Since the movie is a historical fantasy in the first place, I wondered why the people who made this movie make a pretense of history? If they are going to throw away the history books, do so and create a script and a movie that flow and tell a story - like the first Elizabeth did. That film is a total fantasy and that is why it worked just fine. This is why this movie was such a killer of time, for people who were making fantasy movie, they tried to turn it into some sort of historical epic!!<br /><br />This plain jane DVD (Amazon's description) won't cut the mustard. This movie really needs to be reedited and re-shot in-order to be save. I doubt if that will occur.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE isn't golden.  Expectations were high after Cate Blanchett's first foray in 1998 as Elizabeth I, but somehow this follow-up film, with the same director (Shekhar Kapur) and writer (Michael Hirst with assistance from William Nicholson), does not reach those heights.  Visually stunning, with an endless array of knockout costumes for Blanchett, special effects and scenery as majestic as any that have been photographed by fine cinematographer Remie Adefarasin and a musical score by Craig Armstrong and AR Rahman - all of these fine attributes cannot cover the weak script and the general lack of character development that hampers the usually exceptional core of actors.<br /><br />The portion of Elizabeth's history covered by the film is the battle with Spain, England being the only country not participating in the Holy War in Europe under the direction of King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Moll&agrave;), complete with the surprise decimation of the approaching Spanish Armada due to the heroism and commitment of Elizabeth with her people.  The surrounding events include Elizabeth's dalliance with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the traumatic (for Elizabeth) beheading of Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), under the advisement of Elizabeth's trusted Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).<br /><br />Blanchett is a consummate actress and manages to inhabit the persona of Elizabeth as much with her glances and body language and silences as with  the meager material from the script.  She IS a Queen reborn.  The remainder of the cast is adequate though shallow, and while each has very little to say they maintain an atmosphere of Elizabethan England.  This is a DVD that could well be watched without the soundtrack and still be entertaining for the visual splendors. It could have been so much more. Grady Harp, February 08</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>When we last left Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett), she was young and inexperienced, struggling to come to terms with ruling a country. We now rejoin her in "Elizabeth: The Golden Age," which begins well into her reign; beginning in the year 1585, the film chronicles the growing tension between England and Spain and culminates with a fierce sea battle. It also examines the relationship between Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), an adventurous seafarer. What we're presented with is less of an actual account and more of a dramatic love story, which basically means that it isn't even close to being historically accurate. But I guess that isn't a bad thing, considering the film's more creative aspects--"The Golden Age" is a triumph of set and costume design, and the performances are top notch.<br /><br />If only the story were at the same level. It would be too much to say that the plot isn't interesting; rather, it isn't interesting enough. Much of the material plays like a run of the mill romance, regardless of the time period. I just know that so much more defined Queen Elizabeth I, and I wish the filmmakers had given her character a little more depth. Not that she's completely shallow--if anything, quite a lot weighs heavy on her mind, not the least of which is her conniving cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton). Most of their rivalry stems from different religious faiths: Elizabeth is Protestant while Mary is Catholic. Hoping to take control of the throne, Mary conspires to have Elizabeth assassinated. Intercepting on Elizabeth's behalf is Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), the Queen's most trusted advisor.<br /><br />On Mary's side is Philip II (Jordi Moll&agrave;), King of Spain, who believes that Elizabeth has turned England into a godless country. He intends to conquer the Queen by sending a mighty armada, and the Spanish Inquisition along with it. Elizabeth understands that England's resources are depleted, as is its money; a counterattack will be much harder to plan and execute. Despite being incredibly strong-willed, something is holding her back, something that's diminishing her confidence. She seems to rely on Raleigh to soothe her, despite not knowing who he is or where he came from. All we do know is that he's arrived home from the New World, where he named a colony in honor of the Virgin Queen (Virginia). We've seen many films that make the Mysterious Stranger engaging or downright sexy--indeed, Raleigh is dashing, flirtatious, and bold. Just watch the way he presents potatoes and tobacco to Elizabeth.<br /><br />Hoping to win favor with the Queen, Raleigh gets close to her favorite Lady in Waiting, Bess (Abbie Cornish), and it becomes obvious that his affections are divided between these two women. This plot device could have been much more interesting had it not been so clich&eacute;; I've seen romantic conflict before, and it's usually reserved for escapist films. But "The Golden Age" is historical in context. I wanted more focus on the impending Spanish attack, especially since it was so intertwined with Elizabeth's assassination plot. The final major sequence does feature some battle, but not enough to be satisfying. It's as if the film fizzles out after spending so much time building itself up. It's not entirely a letdown, but it is a disappointment. This is especially true of Elizabeth's pre-battle speech: clad in armor, she rides a horse in front of her army while spewing encouraging sayings. I half expected her to say that the enemy may take their lives, but they'd never take their freedom.<br /><br />Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. I greatly enjoyed Blanchett's performance; she gave Elizabeth a determined yet fragile quality that was compelling. I distinctly remember an emotional outburst aimed at the Spanish ambassador: "I too can command the wind, sir!" she screams. "I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!" This moment was raw and overwhelming, which was appropriate given her emotional state. I also remember a scene in an astrologist's lair showing Elizabeth's desperation. She clearly couldn't stand not knowing how everything would turn out. It was prophesized that two kingdoms would battle and only one would fall--the Queen would like nothing more than to hear that England will be victorious. Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed.<br /><br />Yes, there is a lot to recommend about "Elizabeth: The Golden Age," and thank goodness that the good outweighs the bad. This is not a perfect film, but it can still get an audience from point A to point B. And it certainly is wonderful to look at; every shot is so richly detailed that you can't help but admire the work that went into it. The costumes are vivid, colorful, and intricate. The sets are lavish and bold, with practically every location dripping with colorful tapestries. The armada attack features a number of convincing special effects. Basically, everything felt real in terms of the film's look. The film's story, on the other hand, wasn't all that it could have been. There's a wealth of material on Queen Elizabeth I, and I can't help but feel that most of it was disregarded to make room for romantic elements. Romance works, but only to a point.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Elizabeth I is considered by many to be among the most significant and fascinating monarchs to ever walk the earth.  She is also regarded as among the most beloved as well.  To create a lush and dramatic series of films about her long and storied rule is by no means unexpected, nor is it very original as the amount of on-screen interpretations of Elizabeth directly reflects the fascination we have in pondering the meaning of her reign.  Elizabeth:  The Golden Age is Shekhar Kapur's sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a>, a film that introduced us to the famous queen and showed us the first part of her reign.  It's funny, I've been watching Showtime's the The Tudors and the most recent episodes have shown us Elizabeth's birth and even a little bit about Mary I, the queen that proceeded her and the daughter of Catherine of Aragon .  Given the nature of the hedonistic protagonists Anne Bolyn and King Henry VIII on that show and its positive portrayal of victimized Catholics such as Saint Thomas More, it was quite refreshing to see the Catholic Church in the interrogation room once again, perhaps where it belongs.  Anyway, the significance in the quasi-history portrayed on both this film and that show compliment each other quite nicely as Spain during the second half of Elizabeth's rule was an absolute god-fearing behemoth and a force to be reckoned with.  Some people have said this film is Anti-Catholic but really, these are the days of the inquisition we're watching.  It might be a task to stay balanced.<br /><br />Elizabeth is fundamentally very easy to sympathize with, after all it isn't really her fault her father was a pervert and her mother his mistress.  Nevertheless, Cate Blanchett has so much range that her performance quietly shows us her less obvious flaws.  I'm convinced that no other actress could portray this queen in a way that justifies her reputation.  The cast is actually great even beyond her though, which is not unlike the first film.  Walter Raleigh is played by Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush is Francis Walsingham and Mary, Queen of Scots is played with great villainy by Samantha Morton.  The film follows the Battle of Gravelines in the Anglo-Spanish War as it's primary battle scene but most of the film is focused on the amazing costumes, music, and sets.  It also ponders Elizabeth's interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />There are massive historical inaccuracies that are for the most part done to heighten drama but some are pretty inexplicable (where the hell was Robert Cecil?).  I guess the inaccuracies would be inconsequential if I didn't also believe that 99% of the audience would see The Golden Age as their only reference to the virgin queen.  I'm not so sure I can forgive that but I know many viewers will.  Elizabeth's famous speech to the troops at Tilbury before the invasion of the Spanish Armada is widely documented but for those who don't know it is regarded as fact, the scene comes off as derivative of just about every Hollywood epic period film made in the last twenty years.  Blanchett is not at fault but her plate armor and lack of femininity in the way the scene is directed actually brought back the long forgotten memories of Milla Jovovich's speech as Joan of Arc in the pathetically amateur Luc Besson film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767845722">The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc</a>.  That isn't to say The Golden Age is as bad a film, it is not.  It captures the magic expected of a portrayal of this leader in flashes but misses the opportunity to capture her most significant speech.  They actually blew it.<br /><br />Anyway, very good looking film with some really great acting, but take heed; the history buffs might take issue with the accuracy, while the movie buffs might mistakenly walk out thinking they've learned something.  I'd like to consider myself a little bit of both so consider this a mixed review leaning toward a partial recommendation for the visuals and performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Oh, the costumes look fabulous.  Ditto the set design and locations.  But come on...Elizabeth comes off as shrill, petty, obsessive, and hysterical here, while Walsingham pops up now and then as a prop.  Sir Walter Raleigh is somewhat interesting, as is the queen's favorite lady, Bess--but the story isn't supposed to be about them, is it?<br />It's also incredibly irritating to watch scene after scene of actors being filmed through frosted glass. Apparently the director and cinematographer couldn't think of anything else to do.<br />The whole film comes off as surprisingly dull, given the potential strength of the subject matter.  Too bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>Alas and anon...just when you thought it was safe to assemble an armada and go back into the water, someone goes and produces another costumer concerning a certain virgin queen. Bollywood director Shekhar Kapur has re-enlisted co-conspirators Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush for one more go at the old girl in "Elizabeth: The Golden Age".<br /><br />Picking up a few decades hence from where he left off in his outstanding 1998 film "Elizabeth", which depicted the ascendancy of the title character, Kapur cheekily condenses a turbulent and historically significant 4-year period (1585-1588) during the reign of Elizabeth I into what appears to be a rather eventful week in the life of HRM.<br /><br />As the film opens, we are introduced to a much more wary and care-worn monarch (an alarmingly thin Blanchett) holding court over England's destiny. Gone is the radiant, rosy-cheeked and free-spirited "Bess" who lit up the screen in the previous film; she has been replaced by a mercurial, slightly paranoid monarch who is constantly on guard against duplicitous well-wishers and sycophants. Even her closest confidants are kept at arm's length, especially her Machiavellian "spymaster", Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).<br /><br />The Queen has two big headaches keeping her on edge. The first is her cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland (Samantha Morton, in a fiercely intense performance) who feels she is the rightful heir to the English throne, not the childless [...]  Elizabeth (who is a Protestant to boot). Mary has some influential Catholic sympathizers at home and abroad, including the other royal pain in Elizabeth's derriere, King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla), who gets his jollies jeering at the English queen and rattling his saber.<br /><br />Elizabeth finds a temporary distraction from all her political woes when the dashing adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, in all his rangy glory) strolls into her court, full of tales and loaded with booty from his latest excursion to the New World. Elizabeth is obviously charmed, but has to suppress her schoolgirl crush for sake of appearances. However, when she learns that Raleigh has fathered a child and secretly eloped with her favorite chambermaid, Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish) she is not so amused, and gives him a nice cozy jail cell to explore for a few years. Not to worry, however-history intervenes and the Queen pardons Raleigh in time to put him in charge of naval defenses in the year of the Armada (1588), which fuels the film's climatic battle scenes.<br /><br />I have to warn you, this is one of those "historical" epics where you have to make a decision going in whether you are going to nitpick and get cranky and argumentative over factual inaccuracies and behavioral anachronisms, or just sit back for two hours and enjoy the opulent pageantry and bodice-ripping court intrigue with a $#!+-eating  grin on your face. Keep in mind that the screenplay was authored by William Nicholson, who scripted the (very) loose re-interpretation of the Camelot legend, "First Knight" and Michael Hirst, who wrote several episodes of Showtime's recent mini-series about Henry VIII, "The Tudors". In other words, this ain't "Masterpiece Theater", folks.<br /><br />Kapur does seem indecisive at times; it's as if he wasn't sure whether he wanted to make an updated version of "Fire Over England" (which depicted Elizabeth and Raleigh embroiled in court intrigue in the year of the Armada) or pay homage to "The Sea Hawk" (the swashbuckling action scenes featuring Owens in full Errol Flynn mode will definitely make history majors twitch). Nicholson and Hirst's dialogue fuels some spirited exchanges between Blanchett and Owen in the first half of the film that reminded me of the clever repartee from "Shakespeare in Love ", but it ultimately clashes with some of the heavier moments later on (Samantha Morton nearly steals the movie in her execution scene, but it seems to belong in a completely different and darker-toned film).<br /><br />If you are a fan of the genre, you will likely be pleased. Blanchett is<br />excellent in the lead role, and Owen is charismatic as always. Rush is good, although his character is a bit one-dimensional (not his fault). One thing for sure-this should be the last of Liz the First for a while. Right? Tell me there isn't another one in pre-production. Prithee, tell me.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>Cate Blanchett has outdone even her own self.She has mastered a role that many actresses have also played,but SHE has become Her Royal Majesty Elizabeth even more so in Shekhar Kapur's newest installment ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE than she was in the first ELIZABETH in 1998.Blanchett is the perfect combination of ice and fire,vulnerability and bullheadedness,sensitivity and rageaholic and masculine and feminine to bring England's savior to the screen.Ms.Blanchett is so in control of herself that the corset  stays tied, but the fear and passion always dwell just below the surface.She is Queen.At one point,Blanchett,in a rage at the Spanish Ambassador screams "I have a hurricane within me"....and she does,because Blanchett does.<br />Blanchett may well see her first BEST ACRESS Oscar this year.She has a Golden Globe and another win would be no surprise.This film has many magnificent qualities going for it,but ultimately it is Cate Blanchett's astute and finely tuned skills as an actress par excellent that carry this film to victory.<br />The year is 1585.Spain is eying the English throne.Sequestered up in Fartheringay Castle in Scotland,Mary Stuart the Queen of Scotland (an amazing and convincing Samantha Morton performance as always) also has her own designs to usurp Elizabeth,"that bastard whore." Elizabeth is still advised by her chief counselor Francis Walsingham (again Geoffrey Rush reprising his brilliant role from the original).Walsingham still has safeguarded England as a Protestant country.Philip of Spain and Mary Stuart, though, are Catholic, and are set to unseat Elizabeth as Queen.But another usurper enters early on;a usurper of the heart,Sir Walter Raleigh (a well made up and swashbuckled Clive Owen).What Kapur does so beautifully with all of these players is to reveal the immense struggle that existed for Elizabeth not only from without, but also within.As Queen she must rule and be obeyed; but she is also a woman who has a heart, and that heart has denied itself many  of life's pleasures in order that she may "be married to England." This is the single brilliance of Kapur's film;though he needs to fit in historical facts to tell the actions that  do indeed occur between the countries and their monarchs, Kapur always keeps his focus always on Elizabeth, the ruler AND the woman.Even as Elizabeth "allows" (somewhat)her chief lady,Bess, to be wooed by Raleigh that she states, "live my adventures through you" or when Elizabeth, clad in armour atop a white steed proclaims to her troops, "We shall not be defeated.Whether in Heaven or on the field of battle,(that was a loose translation!) we shall return victorious" ,our focus is always on this miraculously strong and clever woman whose reign brought prosperity to England that would last three centuries.Kapur is confident in his Queen "Cate" to deliver the goods...and she does.Kapur has his Elizabeth calmly slip her royal signet ring onto her finger and has her in an almost Moses-like stance facing the raging winds and the thunder and lightening as she surveys, in her night clothes, the fighting ships in the Channel.Here Elizabeth is the warrior and the woman in one...powerful and mighty to withstand the Spanish onslaught.<br />The battle between the British and the Spanish Armada off the white cliffs of Dover is awesome and powerful to behold. The Channel is ablaze with blasting canons and "fire ships".One scene that Kapur vividly implanted in my mind is that of a white mare jumping from one of the Spanish ships.Kapur's camera follows the horse from underneath,swimming in the fiery waters, while Roman crosses and goblets fall to the Channel floor along with the bodies of dead warriors.This is a very arresting piece of camera work and symbolism of the Spaniard's defeat from which they never recovered.<br />I would be remiss if I did not mention the totally engrossing soundtrack that propelled all of the action forward while never over-asserting itself.That is the hallmark of a fine soundtrack.<br />Did I love it? ABSOLUTELY.<br />Would I see it again? DEFINITELY.<br />Will I purchase the DVD? Yep (but it is awesome on a big screen and will be significantly diminished!)<br />Will Cate Blanchett get her first BEST ACTRESS Academy Award? So far,POSITIVELY.<br />What else makes this movie magnificent? Costumes,Sound,Cinematography,Original Screenplay,Editing,supporting actors.<br />Yeah...it was THAT good!As a sequel, it fulfilled all my hopes.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Cate Blanchett alone makes this movie fantastic.  Her characterization of Queen Elizabeth is genius - every cell in her body becomes the powerful queen.  Cate Blanchett shows Queen Elizabeth's ability to change "masks" -  The queen who holds court shows her intelligence, strength, ruthlessness, yet has a sense of ironic humor.  The queen in private shows her emotions, love, and fears.  There are threats all around her.<br /><br />Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) appears on the scene and throws his cloak below her feet so she does not step in a puddle.  His dashing ways attract her as someone different from the boring duties of the Court.  He tells of exciting adventures with savages, brings strange exotic items from the New World:  potatoes and tobacco as well as a few Native Americans. her Court.  Sir Walter distracts and intrigues her - makes her weak, she knows her rules  as Queen, yet she needs him near.  He notes that he has named territory after the Virgin Queen "Virginia."<br /><br />She wants to focus on her responsibilities instead of personal matters.  Skullduggery and<br />treachery is all around.  There are fights on what religion should be practiced - an Armada that carries the Spanish Inquisition is coming to England to crush out the Protestants and make Catholicism the national religion. She depends on her advisor Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to flush out her betrayers.  Her own cousin, Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) is plotting to have Elizabeth assassinated.<br /><br />Again, Cate Blanchett is riveting as Queen Elizabeth, and the movie revolves around her role.  The movie is excellent and the beautiful costumes, landscapes and sets frame the actress well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>In retrospect, the only good things about this film were a) we saw it in a spanking new theater, b) aside from me and my wife, there was only an elderly couple in the 100+ seat theater, which allowed me to fart freely, without distracting sneers from those I might offend with bowel scents, and c) it was stadium seating, which meant I could rest my feet up. Other than that, this film was the Al Pacino Scarface, sans drugs and bad Cuban accents but plus gaudy costumes: i.e.- bad, but highly mockable. Can I recommend such a melodrama? I don't know, I really don't- unless shadow puppeteering is your bag. Move over, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, here comes Lousy Liz and the Spanish Armada!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OY8NBK">The Good German</a>). Blanchett reprises her role as the highly successful mother to a nation -- England -- from the 1998 film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a>.<br /><br />With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.<br /><br />The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, "Bess" (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XA5K48">Shoot 'Em Up</a>).<br /><br />Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).<br /><br />The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.<br /><br />Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.<br /><br />This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, "Yeah. Seen it. Been there."</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>There is something stubbornly old-fashioned about Shekhar Kapur's 2007 sequel to his 1998 art-house triumph, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a>. I don't mean the newer movie is a stodgy historical pageant. Far from it, all the production values are first-rate, including a relatively seamless use of CGI in the Spanish Armada sequence, but beyond all the pomp and circumstance, the mindset of the story is pure 1940's-era studio melodrama. Set in 1585, the film picks up the Queen's life a quarter century after the first film, and what follows in the strangely cautious screenplay by Michael Hirst and William Nicholson is a simplistic portrait of an aging, superstitious woman aware of her power but ironically at a loss to define her own fate. This period of her life is familiar from a number of previous films and miniseries, but this time, the psychological complexity behind such a fascinating historical figure has been downgraded in favor of romance novel plot turns and paper-thin character development.<br /><br />The set-up is rich with possibilities only partially realized onscreen. Protestant England is on its knees, as Roman Catholic Spain has become Europe's most powerful country. Now in her early fifties, Elizabeth is vulnerable since Phillip II of Spain is intent on conquering England and especially because she has not married and produced an heir. Next in line is her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, a devout Roman Catholic imprisoned in a castle in Northamptonshire. Elizabeth has proven to be a tolerant ruler as she allows her country's Roman Catholics to maintain their religious beliefs, even though they see Mary as the only rightful Queen. In the meantime, Sir Walter Raleigh has just returned from the New World and stimulated Elizabeth's passion for adventure and her long-dormant desire for romance. Complicating matters is Elizabeth's devoted lady-in-waiting, Bess, a comely beauty who attracts Raleigh's attention. Just as this standard triangle is established, there is a threat on Elizabeth's life known historically as the Babington Plot. Mary is beheaded for her connection to the plot, which gives Philip free rein to gain the Pope's approval to attack England. Elizabeth inspires her troops to face off with the much larger Spanish Armada, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />It's no surprise that Cate Blanchett commands the screen in the title role and does her best to fill in the blanks left by the routine script. She manages to imbue the Queen with a hidden vulnerability at which comparatively imperious predecessors like Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson merely hint. The one drawback is that she is too young for the role, a point emphasized by the periodic and somewhat conceited use of flashbacks from the previous film in which her appearance has not changed significantly despite the make-up. Geoffrey Rush returns from the first film as Elizabeth's advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham, but he has less to do this time. As Raleigh, Clive Owen has no problem playing a dashing figure, but he seems more like a romantic's fabrication of what a bodice-ripping swashbuckler should be. Speaking with a strange burr, Samantha Morton has precious few scenes as the fanatical but forgiving Mary, and her pouty face and petulant manner seem at odds with previous characterizations. As Philip, Jordi Moll&agrave; is forced to play the king as a religious zealot, while Abbie Cornish's Bess strikes me as far too contemporary in manner to be credible as a lady-in-waiting, especially with the ongoing hints of lesbianism and a soft porn-like lovemaking scene with Raleigh.<br /><br />Guy Dyas' production design, Alexandra Byrne's costumes and Remi Adefarasin's cinematography are all impressive in their splendor and meticulous detail, though I found the music by Craig Armstrong and A.R. Rahman far too intrusive. There are several extras with the 2008 DVD release starting with Kapur's commentary track, often insightful but excessively verbose. An eleven-minute making-of featurette is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film. Three other shorts are included - one on Dyas' intensive work on the production design, one on the recreation of the climactic battle with a mix of ship replicas and CGI, and one on the actual locations used for the filming. There are nine minutes of deleted and extended scenes including one that too-realistically shows Mary's decapitated head. None of these extras helps make the experience of watching this film any more involving.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Elizabeth: The Golden Age" entrances.  Presented at the Toronto Film Festival, Cate Blanchett is riveting.  The range of queen to a private woman with doubts & desires is exquisite.  Blanchett played in the 1998 film "Elizabeth" & was nominated for an Oscar.  She won Best Supporting Actress for "The Aviator" in 2004 and was nominated for "Notes on a Scandal" in 2006.  She centerpieces the film.<br /><br />An array of excellent players includes Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh. Nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2004 for "Closer," Owen flirtatiously woos Elizabeth.  Geoffrey Rush plays Sir Francis Walsingham who connives adeptly.  Rush won Best Actor for "Shine" in 1996, nominated again in 2000 for "Quills."<br /><br />Australian beauty Abbie Cornish, memorable in "Somersault" and played in "A Good Year" with Russell Crowe, portrays Elizabeth's closest attendant, Bess Throckmorton.  With stunning good looks, she displays great range from the official to personal with Sir Walter to concern for her cousin.<br /><br />Her cousin Francis Throckmorton is played by Steven Robertson.  In brief scenes, he is memorable, urging Bess to help him regain favor with the Queen and in torture as Rush's Walsingham wrenches information from him.  Robertson had a small role in Orlando Bloom's "Kingdom of Heaven."<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne, who was Matt Damon's son in "The Good Shepard," plays Thomas Babington who attempts to assassinate Elizabeth with an unloaded gun.  He's great face-to-face with Blanchett.<br /><br />Samantha Morton has 5 films this year & plays Queen Mary Stewart of Scotland with regal bearing and the nervous repose of a political plotter.  I'll always recall her looking at Tom Cruise in "Minority Report" and shouting "RUN!"<br /><br />Shekhar Kapur directs as with the 1998 "Elizabeth."  He has since directed "The Guru" and "The Four Feathers."  Michael Hirst wrote the screenplay for the 1998 "Elizabeth."  He is joined by William Nicholson who has screenwriting Oscar nominations for "Shadowlands" (1993) & "Gladiator" (2000).<br /><br />The wonderful cinematography from colorful pageantry to somber prisons is by Remi Adefarasin who shot the 1998 film plus Woody Allen's 2005 "Match Point" & Michael Apted's "Amazing Grace."<br /><br />Also starring is costume designer Alexandra Byrne.  Her costumes are gorgeous & stunning.  Byrne's 3 Oscar nominations for costume design include Hamlet (96), Elizabeth (98) & "Finding Neverland" (04).  She costumed "Sleuth" with Michael Caine & Jude Law.<br /><br />Elizabeth is a stunning film that sweeps us into the epic, keeps us entranced with a story that does not drag, is performed exquisitely & leaves an appreciation for this era.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />"Elizabeth: The Golden Age" picks up pretty much where 1998's "Elizabeth" left off.  The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England.  On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without.  The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth`s own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.<br /><br />Whereas the first "Elizabeth" was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading).  Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time.  The scenes depicting this more or less "platonic" love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly.  Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping "pirate," Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in "The Golden Age."  She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen.  In an obvious effort to make her more "identifiable" to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film.  This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, "regular" commoner.  The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham.<br /><br />Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being.  For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative.  Lucky for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene (although I do wish that he had toned down the music a scosh).<br /><br />The first "Elizabeth" was a genuinely great film; yet, while this second installment may not be quite as "golden" as either its title or its pedigree might suggest, it's still hard to resist the lure of that Elizabethan magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things:<br />-Looks historically/culturally accurate.<br />-Pretty good filming style with lots of good-looking shots.<br />-Excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth (would be comparable to Helen Mirren's performance in "Elizabeth I").  Very deep, complex, and moving.<br />-Clive Owen is in it, and does okay for himself.<br />-Strong symbolism...I think...<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Action scenes are brief.<br />-Some parts are confusing unless you pay close enough attention.<br />-Some parts were shot through glass or veils, creating some wierd images (although this could also be a good thing, because it is visually mesmerizing).<br />-Action scenes are very brief; particuarly dissapointing for seeing the Spanish armada being wiped out.<br /><br />As a historical drama, this one works quite well.  It has a good style with lots of strong, memorable visuals.  Queen Elizabeth's character stands out tremendously well, and the other characters are not bad either.  However, this is not like watching "Braveheart" or anything; there are very few action scenes, and they are brief.  This is a film to see more for the artistic value, history, characters, and emotions, not for battles.<br /><br />This is the sequel to the 1998 film "Elizabeth," which also had Cate Blanchett, but one could watch this one on its own (the previous one dealt with the earlier stage of her life).</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The '00 release `Elizabeth - the Golden Age' is a visually stunning but overall ponderous exercise clearly showing how difficult the making of a worthy sequel can be. While the production values, costumes, soundtrack and cast are superb it's definitely lacking the magical "something" that raises a good film to a great one.<br /><br />There are some haunting cinematic moments not soon to be forgotten such as the sight of Elizabeth standing on a distant cliff along the dark and stormy coastline viewing the Spanish Armanda ablaze on the horizon, or the image of Elizabeth garbed in white armor with matching horse extolling the troops to greatness as her long flowing red hair and demeanor bears a striking resemblance to Saint Joan of Arc.<br /><br />Unfortunately the role of the legendary monarch is not fleshed out to the extent as it was in the script of the first film, leaving Cate Blanchett little new territory to explore within the psyche of the Virgin Queen. She is left with little to do other than vacillate between a compulsive control freak and a lonely, scorned lover along with occasionally striking a Madonna-like pose while the majestic soundtrack blares in the background clearly attempting to instill within the mind of the viewer a sense of awe and holiness.<br /><br />On the positive side, the most interesting addition to the storyline is Clive Owen in the role of explorer Walter Raleigh. It's only in Blancehtt's scenes with Clive that her character is allowed to show any emotional or intellectual depth. On a more personal basis, being by nature inclined to the arcane, I particularly appreciated the inclusion of the royal seer Dr. John Dee in the storyline.<br /><br />My Raing: Good, but not great, -3 ? Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I really didn't hear any buzz about this one and I wish I had. I rented and will probably buy it. It is one of the best historical dramas that I have seen. Beautifully filmed with great acting and costumes. Many movies have shown bits and pieces of Elizabeth before with Betty Davis being one of the best, but this rivals even her magnificent classic version.  I highly recommend you catch this visual treat with substance. The movie centers on Protestant Elizabeth dealing with the Catholic King Philip II of Spain. His Inquisition is sweeping Europe and threatens the freedoms of all, including the English. Spain plots war with the assistance of the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots. Some magnifcent scenes including the battle in the English Channel with the Spanish Armada make it a feast for the eyes. The acting is quite good though so we never feel as though this is just eye candy. Fans of the movies "Apocalypto" and "Elizabeth" should see it. Excellent DVD with good replaybility.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Two faiths, two empires, two rulers, colliding in 1588. Papist Spain wants to bring down the heretic Elizabeth. Philip is building an armada but needs a rationale to attack. With covert intrigue, Spain sets a trap for the Queen and her principal secretary, Walsingham, using as a pawn Elizabeth's cousin Mary Stuart, who's under house arrest in the North. The trap springs, and the armada sets sail, to rendezvous with French ground forces and to attack. During these months, the Virgin Queen falls in love with Walter Raleigh, keeping him close to court and away from the sea and America. Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Blanchett is magnificent in her strange, enigmatic and multi-dimensional character, constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counter-plotting to take her down at her Court, in her government, and, from foreign lands. This movie does entertain, sending me on a delightfully exciting spell-bound journey to separate legend and myths from historical facts. This movie makes English history fun to browse all over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>I loved the first "Elizabeth" with Cate Blanchett, and so was eager to see the follow-up.<br /><br />It doesn't compare.<br /><br />It is gorgeous in design and costumes.  For the most part the acting is good.  But the plot and the writing are stiff.<br /><br />Everything is a set piece.  People simply pose, deliver their lines, and swirl away.  This makes the movie curiously static.<br /><br />There isn't much interaction between characters.  This becomes blatant with Clive Owen.  I have heard Owen declare in an interview that actors don't have to show "emotion."  Well, in this one, he certainly doesn't.  He has two expressions: Amused in a Superior Way, and Sternly Serious.  These get old fast, and contribute nothing.  Owen is a kinetic actor like Tom Cruise, and when he is not in motion he is dull, almost embarrassing.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush is also wasted in this one.  He puts in his cameos and vanishes.<br /><br />Worst of all, the plot jigsaw never fits together.  There is a vague suspense theme, involving Mary Stuart and Phillip II, but it is so un-suspenseful that it hardly makes sense.  There is even a suspense underplot, involving the Walsingham brothers, but again, it is limp to the point of sleepy.<br /><br />The movie ends up feeling like a series of glamorous stills.  Nothing exciting happens.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>As many other reviewers have said, this movie pretty much takes off where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth (Spotlight Series)</a> left off, however now she is no longer a Queen in waiting but a powerful monarch who has the unsavoury task of keeping Spain from invading her shores, as well as fending off attempts to get her to marry, for a woman such as Elizabeth would not be willing to share power with the man who might be King.<br /><br />As to this melting pot unrequited love, wonderful scenes from history, who can forget Raleight and the cloak over the puddles scene, as well as murder, treason and intrigue, don't forget Mary Queen of Scots here, and of course Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's right hand man and Britain's first true spymaster and you have a film that totally takes your breath away.<br /><br />Forget the fact that historically there are probably more holes in it than a Swiss Cheese, the movie follows the spirit of the era in my opinion and is worth seeing just for the quality acting from Cate Blanchett as the passionate Elizabeth, Geoffry Rush as the deadly Walsingham, and the lovely Samantha Morton as the doomed Mary Queen of Scots, along with sumptious constumes, a great soundtrack, some nifty special effects.<br /><br />I liked this film, it is as good if not better than the film Elizabeth and its a real shame it has not been nominated for more Oscars, certainly it deserved it considering what did get nominated this year!</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>While I am not a history buff and do not seek out history books to read as recreation I found this movie to be interesting and as a result started doing some research on the history of that era. The movie as stand-alone entertainment is far superior to the first movie in this series, Elizabeth. The pace of the movie never lagged and the scenery was splendid as it portrayed England during a turbulent period of its history.<br /><br />As I expected, Cate Blanchett did a marvelous job portraying the queen as did the other actors in their roles. The visual effects of the battle with the Spanish Armada were very well done and the scene of Elizabeth encouraging her troops before the battle almost brought tears to my eyes. The audio and video quality is both excellent.<br /><br />There are a number of special features which include one rather grotesque shot of a decapitated head. One problem we encountered involved understanding all the words; it seemed as if the music got louder as the actors started whispering making it very difficult to catch all they were saying. We solved that problem be activating English subtitles; after that we didn't miss a word.<br /><br />The movie provides an exciting evening's entertainment and I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I don't have much to say here so I'm going to try something new.  I'm going to use a single sentence to convey my thoughts on each facet of this film.<br /><br />The Script:<br />A confused history lesson delves into campy soap operatic tones that snuff out the more interesting bits.<br /><br />The Direction:<br />A total step backward from its grittier 1998 predecessor, Kapur tries to add too much gloss and loses his core along the way.<br /><br />The Acting:<br />Clive Owen is a joke, Abbie Cornish can't act, Cate Blanchett is shocking bland and unfocused and Samantha Morton steals the whole show with a handful of scenes (she's amazing).<br /><br />The Technical:<br />Some overblown visuals look cheesy and fake, but the costumes are divine and the texture of the set pieces are organic and splendid to look at.<br /><br />In the end I hope that they stop here.  I loved the 1998 film, and Blanchett in it, but this was a disaster that failed on nearly every level, the Oscar winning costumes aside.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is the perfect example of history as entertainment and although the authenticity of the history may take second place to the entertainment, this still makes for engrossing viewing. Following Queen Elizabeth in her middle years this films explores the romance of Sir Walter Raleigh, the Catholic assassination plots, Mary Queen of Scots treason and the Spanish Armada. The costumes and sets are stunning and are the key aspects that really makes this film. Blanchett's performance is as good as the first film (which you don't have to have seen to enjoy this film) and the supporting cast do an ample job at providing the drama and intrigue to the storylines. Clive Owen is especially good as the lovable rogue, Raleigh, and is very credible after seeing him in less impressive roles in other films. The veracity of the history may be in doubt, but the adventure and drama in the story more than make up for this and as long as you are aware of it, this film makes for a couple of hours of good viewing.

Film focuses on the time in British history when Spain, the most powerful country in Europe, attempts to invade Britain in the name of the Catholic faith.  The premise film makes is that Spanish are using Mary, Queen of Scotland, as a bait for Elizabeth to give Spain a reason for invasion.  Important favorite at that time of Elizabeth's reign is Sir Walter Raleigh, who ends up marrying her favorite lady-in-waiting Bess.  Film attempts to cover many aspects of that time: clash between catholic and protestant faith, conflict between liberty and inquisition, Elizabeth's internal struggle between her duty as a queen to her country and her own need for love and loyalty of the man. One constant about all films about this fascinating queen is that she was strong, wise and dedicated ot her service toher people.  Her sense of duty and leadership overrode principal requirement of the time - to marry another prince and create political alliance with another strong European royal powerhouse.  She has managed to deliver prosperity to England and help protestanism establish its roots there.  She has redefined history as a woman, ruler and a political figure of her time who was able to control church, her court and her royal subjects with her wit alone.  However, the full acting credit in this film should go to Samantha Morton in her role of Queen Mary.  Ms. Morton has delivered wonderful depiction of the queen who dies for her faith and her belief of what is righteous life and reign ought to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>The follow-up film to 1998's "Elizabeth," "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" continues the story of Elizabeth I, played by Cate Blanchett, who reprises her role from the previous film. The film deals with the Virgin Queen's relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh, while King Philip II of Spain amasses a massive armada to destroy Elizabeth, and replace her on the throne with Mary, Queen of Scots.<br />While the film does take dramatic license with historical events, it is a moving, powerful portrayal of the life and times of Elizabeth I. Blanchett is once again fantastic as Elizabeth, while Clive Owen is great as Raleigh. Samantha Morton (Mary), Geoffrey Rush (Walsingham) and Jordi Moll&agrave; (Philip II) give strong supporting performances. While the story itself is a bit slow during the first half, it picks up in the second half, with fantastic visual effects and action creating a powerful reenactment of the fight with the Spanish Armada off the British Coast.<br />If you enjoyed the original "Elizabeth," then you will find equal enjoyment out of "The Golden Age." But if you haven't seen the first film, you'll be sure to enjoy this film all the same.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>The sets, the costumes, the sheer beauty of the landscape is enough to earn this film a 5 star rating.  Parts of this film were so gloriously done they inspired the awe I feel looking at an illuminated text with the gorgeous gold leaf border and kid smooth binding.<br /><br />Cate Blancett was stellar as an aging Queen Elizabeth, coping with the decline of her fertility while she still had to play the game of trying to find a suitable man to sit beside her on the throne.  Her wit dealing with Sir Walter Raleigh had everyone in the theatre laughing at one particular line regarding Raleigh's proposed name for his colony.  Her quandary over dealing with Mary, Queen of Scots was touching--what should she have done with a kinswoman and Queen.  Her leadership during war was inspiring.<br /><br />I do not have sufficient scholarship in English history to comment on the verity of the romantic storyline with Sir Walter Raleigh. The general accounts are true, whether they were over-stated for film purposes or not should be determined by someone with more knowledge than I.<br /><br />I will say the film was very worth attending and I'm glad to have seen it full screen in a theatre.  While modern home technology does do a fine job of rendering films--there's nothing to compare with a large-scale screen for the more gorgeously filmed movies.<br /><br />I'm predicting at least a nomination for Blancett as Elizabeth as well as for the costumers, set designers and cinematographers.  This may well be a movie to buy when it comes out--particularly if you have the capability to really showcase this gorgeous film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Conflict between Protestants and Catholics flares as Philip II (Jordi Molla) of Spain plots the assassination of Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) and the invasion of England.  Meanwhile, on the home front, a romantic triangle heats up between Elizabeth, her favorite handmaiden Bess (Abbie Cornish), and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen).<br /><br />No doubt the first Elizabeth film took its share of liberties with historical fact, but at least it was a serious examination of how a powerful and resourceful woman came to power, maintained her position, and the price she paid for it.  This sequel is a combination of soap opera and Errol Flynn-type swashbuckler, peopled by one-dimensional characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Elizabeth - The Golden Age", the second part of a planned trilogy, features Cate Blanchett reprising her Academy Award nominated role from almost ten years ago. She is very good, she is always good, and one of three actresses I would watch read the phone book. The other two are Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. And Clive Owen is suitably dashing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but "The Golden Age" is lacking. In many ways.<br /><br />In 1998, "Elizabeth" caused a sensation because Blanchett turns in an electrifying performance. Also, the film is stunningly gorgeous. And it continues our fascination with British royalty by depicting a small part of perhaps the most interesting monarch's reign. It was also our first visit to this oft-filmed monarch's life in a while, so it was interesting, refreshing and new to watch this director's and this actor's interpretation of the role. Since then, HBO produced a multi-part miniseries featuring Helen Mirren playing the same role. With more than six years between the two projects, we had enough time to give Mirren fresh eyes for her interpretation of the same monarch. The HBO project covers much of the same ground as 1998's "Elizabeth" but also goes further, to show her facing down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart, the Spanish king and more. Now less than two years after this memorable turn, we have "The Golden Age" featuring Blanchett playing Elizabeth as she faces down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart and the Spanish King's threats to invade England. Due to the proximity of the two films, "The Golden Age" draws unfavorable comparisons.<br /><br />"The Golden Age" seems `light' somehow. Like the force behind the story of the first film and the force of the production as a whole has been diluted. The film has more than one shot of Blanchett in an elaborate costume standing in the middle of a room as the camera circles her. This is interesting the first time, but when it happens a couple of times, it dilutes the power of this vision. We get it. Elizabeth has the weight of the country on her shoulders. And as queen, she gets to wear some amazing outfits. But when the shot is repeated, it seems designed to show off the costumes and appear to be filler rather than to help the story.<br /><br />Blanchett is, as always, good. She is one of those actors who I think are incapable of giving a bad performance. Sure, they have appeared in bad films, but they are always interesting. As Elizabeth, she plays a character that seems tailor made for her, to accentuate the regal bearing of the actress. But in "The Golden Age", many of Elizabeth's best moments, her most powerful, were just portrayed by Mirren. Unfortunately, there are almost identical scenes and this really does "The Golden Age" and Blanchett a disservice.<br /><br />Blanchett is a forceful personality and it is fun to watch her flirt and hold court. She really shows us many aspects of the monarch's character and life. But we don't get a feeling for the character's Virgin Queen status. Yes, we see her suitors and there are a couple of mentions made of this fact, the Queen's unmarried and unable to sire an heir, but it doesn't seem to be the pressing need we have come to believe. Too bad, because this is a fairly important part of her life. And it was a big part of Mirren's performance. Instead, "The Golden Age" concentrates on the impending conflict with the King of Spain.<br /><br />Enter Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh. Upon his arrival at Elizabeth's court, he introduces himself and announces he has just returned from the New Land and named a colony Virginia, after the Queen. His gifts include potatoes and he brings two Native American Indians with him. But the impending threat of Spain changes Raleigh's actions; initially, he seems attracted to the Queen, and she him, but then his affections turn towards a younger member of the Queen's court, the Queen's most trusted friend.<br /><br />As Spain prepares their armada for war, Raleigh jumps into action and begins to help the smaller British fleet defend England. As the Spanish ships attack, Owen swings from ship to ship, channeling the spirit of Errol Flynn. He even appears a little like the former swashbuckler film hero. The actor brings a dashing quality to the character, making him a bit of a rogue, a bit of a hero, a bit of the bad boy. It is no wonder the Queen falls for him.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush returns as Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's advisor. As he is sick throughout most of the film, he mostly stands by her side, raising his arched eyebrow when he doesn't agree or approve of something the monarch has said or done.<br /><br />Rhys Ifans has a brief role as Robert Reston, a Catholic plotting to kill Protestant Elizabeth on behalf of the Catholic king of Spain. And Samantha Morton plays Mary Stuart, the woman at the center of many of Elizabeth's headaches.<br /><br />"The Golden Age" is beautiful to look at; the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to recreate the royal palaces and London of Elizabeth's age. The ships in the Spanish and British fleets are also particularly impressive. During the battle between the two fleets, we get a real sense for what life was like on these ships. Life and death.<br /><br />But the film fails to fully engage us in the story. If you go to see this film, you probably have at least a rudimentary grasp of the history of these events. So the film should not have to work hard to engage us in the lives of Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh and the Queen's court. It should work hard to give us insight into the woman's life, the woman's thoughts, and the woman's feelings. But instead, it seems to want to focus more on the action-packed parts of the story, to make it more of an action film. It is almost seems like the filmmakers would like to recast Elizabeth in the mold of Sarah Connor, the role created by Linda Hamilton in "The Terminator" films. This doesn't work and detracts from the already interesting elements of the story.<br /><br />"Elizabeth - The Golden Age" is a bit of a wash. It features a strong performance from Cate Blanchett, a dashing performance from Clive Owen and looks beautiful, but it doesn't engage enough or give us enough insight into the monarch herself.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>"Elizabeth," the first film, was about a young woman coming to the throne in a period of great turmoil, and how she dealt with that... It was love in the context of power, betrayal, and survival...<br /><br />In "Elizabeth: The Golden Age," we're dealing with the most famous aspects of her regime, the Spanish Armada, the Babington Plot, which was a major plot against her, and Walter Raleigh bringing back the very early understanding of the New World, and the horizons beyond Britain... It is the exploration of unrestricted power...<br /><br />Elizabeth, as cultured and as intelligent and eloquent as she was, had never left the shores of England... And into her court, strides an explorer who has literally been where the maps end... The gallant Raleigh (Clive Owen) was a free spirit who thrills the queen with his tales and discoveries at sea ... The classic 16th-century adventurer who doesn't play by any official rules, and he does bring into the world of the court something very alluring, enigmatic and charismatic, which has a big impact on the queen...<br /><br />The relationship between Raleigh and Elizabeth was very complicated... There were things holding Elizabeth back... "We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love." These words were spoken by Sir Walter Raleigh to the Virgin Quenn...It's very rare that the Queen takes interest in a man, and she does...<br /><br />At this special point, England was very weak militarily... Elizabeth had discharged the navy... And once again it was the old problem of religious instability, which harasses the human race frequently...<br /><br />Anybody that's interested in this period of history will find it fascinating just how capable Elizabeth was in regards to how she dealt with the captive Queen of Scots...<br /><br />Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) had great respect for the Protestant Elizabeth, and was remarkably intrigued by her, and desperate to meet her, and fascinated... For several years Elizabeth suffered about her execution because she really believed two things... She believed that any queen was divine... She accepted as true that her Catholic cousin was there by the will of God, and therefore, Mary was there by the will of God... And in executing Mary, she would disintegrate her one belief that she herself was divine...<br /><br />Mary found it in death... Elizabeth had to find it in life... So if you look at the Armada, Elizabeth finally does become divine, and that's why we had to admire how the scene of the Armada is shot, by Shekhar Kapur, in that way... It's not actually a fiery sea battle between two countries... It's a 'Holy War' with Spain... Therefore, the defining moments of the Armada is when Elizabeth walks up across the verdant cliffs in flowing white nightgown... She's no longer the Avenging Queen... She's instead a supernatural being, a disembodied soul defeating the enemy, dominating the fearless of the waves, the force of the storm, and the strength of fire...<br /><br />Dripping with intrigues, plots, battles, mysteries, and strong emotions, the film captured the ecclesiastical spaces of the cathedrals to look more like a palace environment... It also captured the feel of the16th century architecture, linking and matching it to the proper locations...</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>Here we have a wonderfully produced semi-epic film, with sprawling scenes... film art at its best; however, it really drags in terms of action.<br /><br />In a more positive defense of the film, if you are really into historically-based movies, I think you'll enjoy this one a great deal. But like similar productions such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007G1WH">Becket</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYY">Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, in an effort to accurately convey the tale the details here prey heavily upon the final achievement.<br /><br />The Story: It's all about the reign of Elizabeth I (1533-1603), daughter of Henry [Tudor] VIII and one of England's most renowned and controversial queens. There's a particular focus on Elizabeth's troubles with both Spain and with the large Catholic population of her country. (Henry VIII had been excommunicated by Pope Clement VII. The King had married the sensual Anne Boleyn, [mother of Elizabeth I] absent the Pope's approval of an annulment from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then Henry subsequently established the Protestant Church of England.) The story also involves Elizabeth's rocky relationship with her Catholic cousin and rival for the British throne, Mary Queen of Scots who was ultimately executed by a malevolent Elizabeth.<br /><br />I feel additionally compelled to remark that the casting for this movie was near-perfect as were the indoor sets and outdoor locations. For this specific reason, I would especially recommend that you view the movie in its widescreen version on the biggest widescreen television you can find.<br /><br />In summary, if history is your thing, you'll likely award this 1 hour and 55 minute film four or five stars. If not, you'll probably be bored to tears.<br /><br />TIP: Many public libraries carry this DVD to loan out free-of-charge... you might consider borrowing it and afterward purchasing it if it turns out that you enjoyed the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>While not quite as great and flawless as its predecessor, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a>, it is, however, something grander in scope for which character development suffers a bit.<br /><br />This sequel is filmed 10 years after the first one, but little is lost along the way.  The same writer and director are back and, of course, so is Cate Blanchett delivering yet another knockout performance as the "Virgin Queen" desperate to love, but all too aware of its perils for a queen like herself.  The supporting cast is again outstanding, and the addition of Clive Owen, my original vote for the next Bond over Daniel Craig, is an example of perfect casting.  Perhaps it's good that Owen wasn't saddled with the Bond films as it has allowed him to do films like this one.<br /><br />My only criticism of this film is also my strongest compliment in that in this film we focus more on the spectacular than on character development, but it's forgivable in that this film is simply portraying an era in Elizabeth's life that was literally more spectacular as Spain rages war on Britain with it's massive and undefeated armada.  This is not to say that we don't have emotional development in this film at all, but rather it's not on the same scale as the previous film.<br /><br />Where I gave <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a> an unqualified flawless 5 star rating, this film also gets 5 stars, but I must qualify it by saying it just not at the same level as the last film.  Both are 5 star films, but his one is just not as flawless in my view.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Elizabeth The Virgin Queen, who bet her own happiness in pursuit of her people, and knew to move the pieces of her Army and navy with notable intelligence is carved in relief once more in this mesmerizing film who allows us once more to admire Cate Blanchet one of the top ten actress all over the world, in this gripping and colossal movie, told with impeccable sobriety thanks to a dynamic and fluid script.<br /><br />With monumental stages and unforgettable landscapes, the film is not only a fest for your eyes but also an important reflection about political leadership in those hard times She was the decisive turning point who conveyed England to become the next Empire of the Western world, after the fall of Spain.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.</p></br></body></html>

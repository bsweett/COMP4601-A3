Its influence on popular science-fiction entertainment cannot be overestimated.<br /><br />The seeds of "Star Trek" are planted here, particularly the use of the ship's captain, executive officer, and surgeon as the principal players. So too is the conceit that the purpose of outer-space travel is to explore inner space -- the human condition. The desire to dress female space travelers in skimpy costumes isn't ignored, either.<br /><br />What makes "Forbidden Planet" such a standout is not that it was the first color science-fiction film (it wasn't), nor that it was the first "good" science-fiction film ("The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Things to Come" come to mind), but rather the lavishness of the production and the unbridled imagination behind it. "Forbidden Planet" catches the viewer right from the start, with a nifty flying saucer and the greatest robot in movie history, in just the first 15 minutes. The visual effects (particularly of the ship passing behind Altair IV to produce an eclipse, and the surface of Altair IV) were state-of-the-art then, and more-convincing-than-not 54 years later.<br /><br />Also novel is the fact that the huge (for its time) $4M+ budget is in service of what is an intellectual story about whether man is basically good or evil, and whether we have the right to "play God". ("Forbidden Planet" owes a great deal to written science-fiction, and little to comic strips or previous films.) It's all dressed up with an ironic/sarcastic robot, and undressed-down with Anne Francis in mini-skirts that leave little to the imagination -- but "FP" is not the special-effects extravaganza we expect modern science-fiction films to be.<br /><br />This might explain why it's taken so long for "Forbidden Planet" to appear on Blu-ray, especially as there was an earlier HD-DVD edition. It appears Warners doesn't think there's much of a market for it. The local Fry's received only /one/ copy, which had not been sold when I walked in around 12:30PM on 9/7. One of the sous-managers told me that many Fry's hadn't received /any/ copies.<br /><br />"Modern" (hah!) audiences might also have problems with "Forbidden Planet"'s less-than-stellar acting (Walter Pidgeon is the only A-list actor). The best performance comes, not surprisingly, from Marvin Miller. His Robby deftly alternates among ironic/sarcastic {"It promotes rust."), hurt ("Again?"), naive ("Stuff, sir?"), threatening ("Will you get in?"), and helpful ("May I be of service?").<br /><br />The script has more than its share of groaners. Though Cyril Hume (an American, not an Englishman), was a decent writer, he clearly failed to read the lines out loud as he wrote them, resulting in some unpleasantly clumsy dialog. (Walter Pidgeon wasn't a particularly good actor, but you can see him trying to improve some of the poorer lines.)<br /><br />Fred McLeod Wilcox's direction has the depth of tissue paper and the subtlety of a steam roller, though its general briskness helps a film that's more talk than action. Leslie Nielsen's delivery of the final line, in which he not only butchers the line, but practically swallows it, is wholly Wilcox's fault. Such poor delivery is (or was) common in American films, but this example is one of the very worst ("I see no enemy" in "Ben-Hur" being the other).<br /><br />"Forbidden Planet" has its problems, but any modern viewer who actually /enjoys/ the garbage turned out by modern film makers has no right to criticize. "Forbidden Planet" might not be "Amadeus" -- but it's /definitely/ not "There's Something About Mary".<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray edition... "Forbidden Planet" was shot on Eastmancolor, which, at that time, could not compete with Technicolor for sharpness or grain. (Technicolor had been abandoned at that point, anyhow.) Grain is sometimes visible, and the image is not as super-sharp as one might like. The transfer is from a composite negative, presumably the one used for the 50th-anniversary edition. As with that version, scenes with animation or static mattes show a significant drop in sharpness and color accuracy, and an increase in contrast. This is unavoidable, the price one pays for the rest of the film looking so good. I'd give it a B to B+ for HD image quality.<br /><br />There used to be a "real" stereo soundtrack for "Forbidden Planet", but the sound on this version appears to be panned mono. "Extras" include everything (I think) that came with the deluxe 50th-anniversary version (other than the metal box, lobby cards, and Robby figurine). These include the "sequel", "The Invisible Boy", an episode of the "The Thin Man" (which has a political twist surprising for its era), and several good "making of" featurettes. (For those interested, Anne Francis looks barely 56, let alone her actual 76.)<br /><br />Rush right out in a buying frenzy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Forbidden Planet", created at MGM in 1956, was a high-budget high-concept science fiction film among the many low-budget sci-fi flicks made for drive-in theaters in that decade. It doesn't possess the intellectualism of "The Day the Earth Stood Still", nor does it hold up as well, but the two films have common themes. Cdr. John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) leads a mission to the planet Altair-4, where an expedition landed 20 years before and has not been heard from since. His ship is warned away by Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), a survivor of the earlier mission. Morbius explains the violent fate met by his colleagues and urges the visitors to leave. Only Morbius and his comely daughter Altaira (Ann Francis) have survived and thrived. Now aware of the disaster, Adams must await instructions from Earth. But some invisible threat still lurks on the planet.<br /><br />It was probably the film's brightly colored Cinemscope, friendly robot Robby, and neat-o special effects that most impressed audiences when it was released, but I was struck by "Forbidden Planet"s obvious influence on subsequent science fiction films and television. The impact on Gene Roddenberry's "Star Trek" was substantial, right down to the costumes, the communicators, and, of course, the allegory -though Roddenberry was decidedly more optimistic. "Forbidden Planet" posits that technology and knowledge do not fundamentally change people. A species cannot grow out of its violent primitivism. A gloomy message for a big, colorful, sci-fi adventure. I don't know what to make of the acting style, which I found peculiarly wooden. But this is a must-see for science fiction fans, if only because it is so recognizable in retrospect.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner 2000): This disc is two-sided, with full screen on one side and widescreen on the other. The print is perfectly watchable but not clean. There are white specks. A theatrical trailer (4 min) is included. George Lucas seems to have taken some visual inspiration from this trailer, though the "Star Wars" saga has more in common with B-movies. Subtitles and captioning for the hearing impaired are available in English, French, and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I just watched this for the first time tonight with my dad. I've seen clips of it in 'John Carpenter's Halloween' The movie itself was okay. I loved the classic sci-fi look and atmosphere it had. Commander Adams takes his team to Planet Altair. They are to check on Dr. Morbius, who has been there for 20 years. While there, they must battle an invisible beast created by the doctor himself. Robby the Robot is awesome and my favorite character.

It was a really old movie then but will always be a classic. Sure the special effects are cheesy, the sets look funny and the acting is laughable at times but for some reason this movie is just COOL! It's the type of scary which leaves a lot to the imagination which makes it all the more frightening. It's about a crew of men in space who's ship gets stranded on a planet inhabited by a man, Morbius and his beautiful daughter Alterra. The planet was once home to a race known as the Krell who dissapeared and left behind their mysterious brain enhancing technology. My favorite part is when the 'monster' melts through the solid metal door and all the alarms are going off, talk about suspense! Something about the sound of the alarms wailing in the background and the door turning red hot was REALLY frightening. It was totally freaky! It's not a bloody or violent film compared to movies of today but it scares you on a much deeper level, proving that OUR MIND can be a greater enemy than any monster. This movie was ahead of it's time. It's a movie that is good for a wide range, both young and old and was made in a time when movies were smart and made you think and were more than just a money machine cranked out by greedy studios!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Like all good film science fiction, &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; keeps its concepts simple but their ramifications grand, which is just one of the reasons it is a timeless classic.  Made at a time when sci-fi was the junk that kept restless kids in theater seats on Saturday afternoons, this ambitious take on Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; nonetheless also aims for adults that grew up on the pulp fiction of the 1920s and 30s.  (Its delightful production design is a seamless mix of colors, forms, and shapes familiar from those imaginative magazine covers.)  The premise is Star Trek a decade before Star Trek, as a military cruiser commanded by the hard-nosed but humane J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen doing an effective melodramatic turn) visits a world populated by a secretive scholar (a wonderful Walter Pidgeon), his curious daughter (a sometimes grating Ann Francis), their robot butler (the epitome of mechanical men) and a mostly unseen terror (illustrated by topnotch Disney animators).  Beyond great special effects and an innovative musical score, the film also engages a firm--if now familiar--science fiction plot, unlike so many of the noisy and expensive but ultimately overwrought and empty-headed sci-fi movies of today.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Leslie Neilson leads his crew to the Forbidden Planet to relieve the watch from years before.

All the stuff runs on mind power. However since man (and all species now for that matter) are basiclly evil in the subconscious, you can create monsters from your Id. You'll just have to watch the movie. If you dose a little while you're watching it you'll be going &quot;huh?&quot; and &quot;what?&quot; <p>Special effects are pretty good for 1956, as is the story itself. It's a little boring for me to consider a must have classic, but I can see how this film can appeal to people on different levels. I'm more of a Plan 9 from Outer Space guy myself. I was hoping and expecting this to be a B-grade hilarious clunker. It's far from it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>As is well known, this is a Sci-fi film loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST meeting Freud's theories of the Id.  But this would count for nothing if the film weren't so extremely well done in other ways.  <p>Although not working with an especially large budget, the makers of the film combined a good story with amazingly innovative set design and clever special effects to produce what is possibly the most satisfying film set in outer space film made during the 1950s.  Shot entirely on a soundstage, the exterior shots of the planet manage to avoid looking at all hokey, and the house in which Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira live, despite looking pure 1950s, manages to somehow seem right at home.  The shots of the interior of the former inhabitants' magnificent structures are some of the best model shots in film history.  Even with today's special effects and CGI scripting, they are impressive.  And Robby the Robot has to go down as one of the great screen robots of all time.  Also among the all time greats, the invisible but nonetheless detectable "monster from the ID" is one of the most satisfying monsters one could imagine.  Almost all movie monsters from the fifties disappoint, at seem to some degree a bit silly, but not this one.  <p>Part of the reason the movie works so well is the cast, which is a cut above average for a fifties Sci-fi flick.  Leslie Nielsen was thirty years away from his debut as a comedian, and plays what was his usual character for the first half of his film career:  a solid if a bit too serious lead.  Walter Pidgeon turns in the strongest performance in the film, as the brilliant Dr. Morbius.  His voice alone makes many of the key scenes in the film work beautifully.  Anne Francis is simply beautiful, and it doesn't take much imagination the effect she would have on a ship full of men who haven't seen a woman in several months.  She manages to be incredibly sexy and completely innocent as successfully as any actress I have ever seen.<p>One can overstress the Shakespeare and Freud connection, but this film does get my vote for the best use of psychology ever made in a Sci-fi film.  It along with the extreme care given to every aspect of this film make it to this day one of the most durable Sci-fi films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Amazon.com's reviewer's excellent review of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; covers all the bases about this superlative science fiction film; my own review can't be nearly as thoughtful. Surely &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; inspired the great space operas which followed in the 1960's and beyond, from &quot;Star Trek&quot; to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and indeed, &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Leslie Nielsen's Commander J. J. Adams is clearly the archetype for Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. His relationship with the ship's doctor, Lieutenant &quot;Doc&quot; Ostrow (Warren Stevens - who later appeared on a classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode.) clearly presages Kirk's relationship with Dr. McCoy. This science fiction adaptation of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; may not have the same literary quality as its predecessor, but it is nonetheless a spellbinding tale about a mad scientist whose uncontrolled emotions wreaks havoc on his adopted planet and Commander Adams' starship. Walter Pidgeon is spectacular as Dr. Mobius, the film's version of Prospero; both Nielsen and Warren are fine as the ship's captain and doctor, respectively. The soundtrack with its theremin score is widely regarded as a classic of science fiction music. Without question, this film is an absolute must for fans of science fiction cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>the 1950s known as the atomic age led to successful series of SC-FI films including "the Day the Earth Stood Still, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers & It Came from Outer Space, the greatest of these films is "Forbidden Planet" starring Leslie Nielsen, Walter Pigdeon, Anne Francis & SC-FI icon Robby the Robot it's a thrilling space adventure with romance & suspense, based on Shakespeare's the Tempest tells the story of a crew on board a flying saucer on a rescue mission to a distant planet called Altair 4 whom they discovered is inhabited by a mad scientist, his daughter, Robby the Robot & an unseen deadly creature.

To make this MGM classic Sci-Fi thriller from 1956 all the more convincing, there is an excellent cast and award winning special-effects, courtesy of Disney. We have love, rage and fear all playing at the same time and it is something to experience -- not just see.<br /><br />WHAT THE 'FORBIDDEN PLANET' IS ALL ABOUT -- [plot spoilers below]<br /><br />It's the 23rd century, and a United Planets Cruiser commanded Commander J.J. Adams [Leslie Nielsen] is on a rescue mission to the planet Altair-4. Apparently, the Earth spaceship Bellerophon vanished, 20 years earlier. The Bellerophon's destination was Altair-4. As we soon discover, there is only one survivor, Doctor Edward Morbius the ship's philologist.<br /><br />According to Webster's New World Dictionary a 'Philologist' is a 'Linguist', 'Scholar', 'grammarian' or 'lexicographer'. This is significant because what Morbius has discovered on Altair-4 will certainly need both a scholar and a linguist to unravel.<br /><br />Strangely and even rudely, Morbius wants no part of any rescue which of course makes Adams very suspicious and they land on Altair-4. What follows is what the film is all about.<br /><br />THE UNSEEN CAN BE VERY SCARY -<br /><br />As the story unfolds, with the help of excellent special effects, especially for 1956, we learn about the disposition of the rest of Morbius's lost crew and find that he has a daughter too. The two are all that have somehow survived some kind of "planetary force". As Adams and his crew remain to investigate and to await orders from Earth, that "planetary force" somehow returns to wreck havoc. If havoc isn't enough then perhaps some fatalities will get Adams to pack it in and scram.<br /><br />BUT WHERE IS THIS FORCE COMING FROM?<br /><br />Remember, I did say it was scary, it is, especially if you allow your imagination to run away a bit. As time goes by, the force becomes more determined [apparently] and Morbius becomes more disturbed. We learn of an ancient civilization called the Krell, that has become extinct and how this has been a source of major technological innovations that are now part of Morbius's household -- like 'Robby the Robot'. How did Morbius build Robby and what is it that we just don't see? There is a monster in this film and it is about as scary a monster as there ever was, literally indestructible and eternal.<br /><br />SO THE FORBIDDEN PLANET IS A MYSTERY TOO!<br /><br />Just what is this 'Planetary Froce', who controls it and what is the motivation for it is the mystery. As the film proceeds, the emotions: some of love, some of rage and some of frustration are building as they might within a pressure cooker. Here, the pacing of the film really helps to build the suspense, tension and fear. Yes, this can be a scary film. I thought so 50 years ago and still do today after hundreds of viewings.<br /><br />***** THE MAJOR PLAYERS *****<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon - Dr. Edward Morbius<br /><br />Anne Francis - Alta Morbius<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen - Commander John J.

Thankfully, this [widescreen VHS] version has them. One scene is not important and involves a pet monkey being shot with an electrical charge to keep him from eating a banana which was on the dining room table in Mobius's home. The other and more significant scene occurs during Morbius's little lecture, and show and tell session with Adams and Dr. Ostrow [Warren Stevens] in the underground Krell facility. The specific scene is where Morbius tells Adams to fire his blaster at the Krell metal. Adams does so and he and Dr. Ostrow are amazed to find that the metal isn't warm after being subjected to their weapon. I always felt badly that this scene was missing as it ties into what happens in the end by demonstrating how impervious Krell metal is to melting, even when fired at by 23rd century blasters [particle beam blaster].<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A TRUE SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT IS 5-STARS IN 1956 & 2006<br /><br />This is from beginning to end and very compelling film that has aged very well and is still chilling to watch. It is an excellent story, has a well played cast, modern effects and great pacing that leads to a dramatic conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This blu-ray version of what is obviously the inspiration for Star Trek is a real treat for fans as the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved.  I remember watching this on the Turner Classic Movies channel and it was barely watchable but now it's like watching a new film!  While the picture quality isn't perfect as there are a few problematic frames here and there but compared to what I saw on the TCM channel the difference is like night and day.  As for the sound quality the DTS HD MA 5.1 sound is fantastic.  The special features are very good as well with great documentaries and even the not-so-good "sequel" featuring Robby the Robot "The Invisible Boy" which comes across more like a kiddy comedy than its much more serious and better prior film.  "Forbidden Planet" marks a number of firsts such as being MGM's first serious Sci-Fi film, the birth of techno music for the score, the depiction of man travelling faster than light and exploring other planets and for fans of Star Trek like myself you get the feeling that you are watching the true pilot of Star Trek: TOS.  Star Trek: TOS is like the serialised tv version of the "Forbidden Planet" feature film like the way it was for "M*A*S*H".  The relationship between the doctor and the captain prefigures Bones and Kirk, the short mini skirts that Anne Francis wears and the sexual innuendoes also show up on Star Trek: TOS while the reference to adamantium metal reminded me of Wolverine and the deep shafts underground reminded me a lot of the Death Star in "Star Wars" and of a couple of episodes in the early seasons of "Babylon 5" concerning the strange being on the planet below the space station.  Even Disney Studios had a hand in the special effects here as MGM takes a genre that was at the time "B" movie fodder into the "A" grade.<br /><br />Fans of Sci-Fi simply have to have this in their video library as an example of a pioneer and major influencer of many sci-fi films that followed.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>It's funny, me being a fan of science fiction and movies in general, why it is that it took me so long to get around to watching Forbidden Planet (1956).  Part of it is I feel as if I've already seen the film, as clips from it are usually always shown whenever someone does a documentary on science fiction in film, as it's just such an influential and amazing piece of work.  Now, I've heard that this movie is loosely based on Shakespeare's play, The Tempest, but since I've never read it, I can't comment on comparisons between the play and the film.  The film stars Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, Leslie Nielsen, and Robby the Robot (Yes, the robot gets a screen credit.  If you look on the Internet Movie Database, you'll find it's even listed as an actor).<br /><br />The story is about a spacecraft sent to learn what exactly happened to a previous spacecraft and its' crew, which had been deployed many years prior, and has since not been heard from in some time.  This current mission is under the command of Commander John J. Adams (Nielsen), and soon find themselves on approach to the destination planet of the now lost ship.  On their arrival, they get an ominous message, from the planet, issued by a member of the original crew, Dr. Edward Morbius (Pidgeon).  Despite his warnings, they land and are soon met by a robot named Robby, who escorts them to Morbius' rather posh abode.  Here we learn all the members of that fated crew have been killed off, except for Morbius and his daughter (whom Morbius had when he procreated with another member of the original crew), Altaira (Francis), by some unseen, yet completely nasty, force, to which Morbius and his daughter seem immune.  Not expecting to find any survivors, Commander Adams now has to change his plans to include trying to contact his superiors and receive further instructions on how to proceed, despite Morbuis' protests that they should leave as soon as possible, leaving him and his daughter behind so that he may continue his research.  What is his research?  Well, it seems that many hundreds of thousands of years ago, the planet was inhabited by a highly advanced race of being called the Krell, who mysteriously vanished seemingly overnight in comparison to their collective power, intelligence and abilities, and while their cities have long since gone, a great deal of their technology survived underneath the ground, and Morbius has managed to gain some understanding of these beings, even being able to pry bits of information and such in the 20 odd years that he's been here.  This amazing discovery is certainly worth writing home about, and so Commander Adams begins having the men disassemble the ship to create a device powerful enough to send a message back to his superiors, and in the meantime, starts making time with Morbius' daughter, who's never seen a man outside of her father, and is uneducated in the ways of woo.  Things seem to be progressing until an unseen late night attack on the ship damages some crucial elements needed for communication, so an electrified perimeter is set up to prevent the approach of any more unannounced and unwelcome visitors.  We soon find out the fence works, as a huge beastie, normally invisible, now highlighted by the electrical current, tries to attack the ship, killing a few defenders.  What exactly is the nature of this beast?  Is it somehow connected to the Krell?  Does Morbius know more than he's letting on?  Will any get off this planet alive?  What the heck were these Krell up to anyway?<br /><br />Forbidden Planet is inspirational, in my opinion, because it presents an well developed and thought out story above and beyond the usual `scary alien' fare we saw in the early 50's.  Similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), it brought a level of intelligence to the genre while managing to also entertain.  Basically, whatever level you view the film on, it will provide enjoyment.  It also hallmarked the first film appearance of Robby the Robot, probably one of the most popular, recognizable, and enduring icons in science fiction film history.  Also, it is important to note, this is the first film to utilize an entirely electronically composed musical score.  Stereotypical characterizations appear to create the various roles, but since the film was releases a good 14 years before I was even born, I can't help but wonder if the stereotypes started here, given the influence of the film.  The production value overall is lavish and indicates little expense was spared in bringing the story to life.  The special effects, even by today's standards, look remarkably good, and the realism in the matte painting backgrounds is truly spectacular.  The tour of the huge underground Krell facility really stood out in my mind, properly highlighting the enormity and intricacies at the same time.  Plot holes?  Yeah, I noticed a few of them (like how'd Robby show up at the end despite every circuit being blown?  And that self-destruct mechanism at the end...that seemed a bit convenient and lacking proper safeguards one would normally apply as to not accidentally cause it to go off), but these tend to pale in comparison to the overall film.  As a whole, I think anyone would be hard pressed not to acknowledge this as one of the more influential films in the genre, and just a lot of fun in general.<br /><br />Warner Brother's gets points from providing an excellent widescreen print (the DVD is double sided, with fullscreen on the flipside), but loses some in their complete lack of special features other than an original theatrical trailer.  I find it pretty sad that this film doesn't rate the special features we so often see on new releases.  Normally I'd be happy with a good looking print, but surely certain films deserve some preferential treatment, and this, in my opinion, is one of them.  Oh well...<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Fifty years after its theatrical release FORBIDDEN PLANET still ranks as one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever created. Of it's contemporaries, only 1951's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL approaches its intelligence and depth. Not until Stanley Kubrick brought us 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was another science-fiction film to take such a thought-provoking approach to the human condition.<br /><br />Much of the credit for the excellence of FORBIDDEN PLANET has to go to its ultimate source material, THE TEMPEST, Shakespeare's last (and arguably greatest) play.<br /><br />A number of reviewers have mentioned "some Shakespear play" (sic) as the inspiration for this film, and others have admitted, "I haven't read it." I strongly recommend that anyone even mildly interested in FORBIDDEN PLANET read THE TEMPEST, and secondarily, that anyone who speaks English acquaint themselves with the Bard of Avon (that's Shakespeare, in case you didn't know...at the very least spell his name correctly!)<br /><br />The film stars Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius (Prospero), Anne Francis as his daughter Altaira (Miranda), Robby the Robot as himself (Ariel), and the Invisible Monster From the Id in the Caliban role.<br /><br />The Forbidden Planet is visited by the crew of the spaceship C-57-D, captained by a very young, very earnest Leslie Nielsen. He is accompanied by his First Officer and Ship's Doctor with whom he trades constant wisecracks (if this all sounds familiar, it's because FORBIDDEN PLANET counts STAR TREK as one of its numerous progeny). FORBIDDEN PLANET's plot also inspired more than one episode of that show.<br /><br />The Robot of LOST IN SPACE owes his existence to Robby the Robot (who later appeared in other pictures besides FORBIDDEN PLANET, a groundbreaking idea at the time). LOST IN SPACE's Jupiter II is a copy of the C-57-D. STAR TREK and LOST IN SPACE were both produced within a decade of FORBIDDEN PLANET, and their creators have credited the film as seminal.<br /><br />C-57-D is searching for survivors of a human colony on the planet. As it turns out, the only survivors are the imperious Dr. Morbius, his irresistibly sexy and utterly innocent twentysomething daughter, Altaira, and Robby the Robot.<br /><br />Morbius informs them that all is fine on the Forbidden Planet and bades them go on their way. Suspicious for no particular reason, the Captain and his pals decide to overstay their welcome. In recounting the history of the planet, Morbius explains that it was once the home of a superintellectual race called the Krell, and that the Krell were destroyed by some unknown force at the very height of their powers. After having the Captain stick his feet in the fire, Morbius admits that the rest of the colonists died as a result of contact with this unknown force. The words are barely out of Morbius' mouth when the crew of C-57-D reports several mysterious deaths.<br /><br />Most of the rest of the film revolves around efforts to battle what turns out to be an invisible monster bent on mindless destruction. The origins of the monster cause one to consider the conundrum of the atomic age: whether a mankind bent on technological advancement is better off than a mankind that lived in a simpler time.<br /><br />FORBIDDEN PLANET never lags. The script is well-honed, and the story moves along at a rapid clip (even for 1956), always keeping the viewer's attention.<br /><br />The dialogue is furiously funny at times. Besides the ongoing byplay between the Captain and his cronies, Earl Holliman hams it up as the ship's often-inebriated cook, who strikes up a satisfyingly one-sided business relationship with Robby the Robot. Altaira is gently amusing. Never having met any man besides her father, she is wide-eyed and curious about the visitors. After the men lead her in some discussion on the subject, she decides she just MUST practice her kissing, a task for which the dedicated crew volunteers at every available moment thereafter.<br /><br />The very attractive Anne Francis (TV's HONEY WEST) is fitted out in some criminally short minidresses which are slam-dunk guaranteed to hold the attention of a typical heterosexual male viewer. A few of her dresses were banned by studio censors as being too much (or too little) and were not used in the film. Her wardrobe definitely gave impetus to the female crew uniforms on STAR TREK. The actual costumes in this movie were later used in the less-than-memorable low-budget QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE, starring Zsa Zsa Gabor as a Venusian woman with a Budapest accent (!). A practice kissing sequence also made it into that film.<br /><br />Miss Francis is the acknowledged original "Space Babe." Though Altaira is essentially a sex kitten role, she manages to imbue the character with dignity and humor, and gives a memorable performance.<br /><br />The sets are all posh and wonderfully futuristic (in a 1950s Swedish modern sort of way). The special effects were cutting-edge for their time. MGM spared no expense in producing this big-budget color picture and hired Disney Studios to create the effects. (Yes, they look rather dated now, but considering they are fifty years old, they hold up surprisingly well against today's CGI.) The electronic soundtrack is still a definite attention-getter.<br /><br />With its balanced mix of science fiction, comedy, and classic drama, FORBIDDEN PLANET stands as one of the finest movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>I've owned the videotape pictured above for a quarter-century.

Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielson) and crew are sent to investigate this mysterious radio silence. When they arrive above A-4, the sole survivor of the original mission, Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) warns that if Adams lands, his ship and all aboard may be in danger.

Robert Kinosh?ta designed Robby and LiS's robot, thus their similarity in appearance and function. Robby's voice is Marvin Miller, best remembered as check-bearer Michael Anthony on TV's THE MILLIONAIRE. The robot's cramped interior was inhabited by little Frankie Darro. For years Darro was a juvenile star in 'B' pictures, even until age 30. Forced to do all his own stunts as there was no one Frankie's size available, stunting became a second career once he was too old to play teenagers.<br /><br />COMMANDER ADAMS' CREW--<br />George Wallace (Bosun) was Commander Cody in the 12-part serial, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDKAJO">RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON</a> (1952).<br />Robert Dix (Crewman Grey) is son of actor Richard Dix.<br />This is the last of Jimmy Thompson's (Crewman Youngerford) seven screen appearances.

This is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Its even more remarkable for being over 50 years old now, as some of the special effects, if dated now, are good enough to make you think 'how the hell did they do that in 1956'? Remember no CGI at all.<br /><br />Its influence on the original Star Trek series in terms of the story and the sets is clear for all to see: A long dead civilisation leaving behind a mind enhancing machine. An apparent Alien force that can't be seen. Sets made of polystyrene etc....<br /><br />Quite a few important Science Fiction films were made in the 1950's, but this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. If you've never seen it you've missed an absolute classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>Forbidden Planet was the blueprint for Star Trek, Lost in Space, Star Wars, It was so influential that you may watch it, and see a whole new genre that popped up because of it. The movie is the first time the world saw the Robbie Robot character, the same robot give or take a few spare parts from Lost in Space. The crew of the space ship was a complete crew even down to a cook. Laser shooters were used in this movie as well, a Hollywood first. That being said it did have some flaws; the characters were all one dimensional. The story went no where at times. Such as the time where the cook got the robot to synthesize bourbon. Yes some of the plot just seemed like filler. I really got the feeling that Dr. Morbius was based on Captain Nemo from 20000 leagues Jules Verne story. The way how he gave the tour of his world and machinery just seemed so familiar to the 20000 leagues story. Overall this is a fine transfer to DVD, and has quite extras on this DVD package. If you love old science fiction campy films this is a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>Any sci-fi buff well knows the exalted place "Forbidden Planet" holds in the history of film.  Ground-breaking effects work.  Costumes.  Matte paintings.  The legendary scenes of the Krel (sp?) power generating machines.  The Krel brain booster, apparently set up for a being with multiple appendages.  The one appearance of the lion-like "Monster From the Id" in the electrical fence while being bombarded by neutron-beam weapons.<br /><br />The one question that anyone who has seen this masterpiece has over the 50 years since the film's release is:  What did the Krel really look like?  The film provides only inferences:  The aforementioned brain booster.  The triangular doors.  The mystery of the appearance of the Krel is a primary aspect that separates this film from all others in the 1950s-and the modern age for that matter.  How many SF films can you name where a character as significant as the Krel makes no visual appearance whatsoever?  The only one I can think of in a similar vein is Universal's "The Invisible Man", but Claude Rains is visible at points in the film.<br /><br />"Forbidden Planet" is really about the mysterious Krel, who were so advanced technologically they were able to gain control over the very essence of their material bodies.  The mystery of why they left no record of their physical appearance only makes the irony of their destruction by the evil of "The Mindless Primitive" within even more interesting.<br /><br />The advent of CGI seems to have all but erased this type of mystery from today's films-to moviegoers detriment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I found this film tremendously entertaining and even enthralling when I first saw it as a teenager. It's held up surprisingly well for me over the years, and not all for nostalgic and sentimental reasons. The movie combines many intriguing themes and elements--the mystery of an advanced but vanished race, attacks by an unseen force, some very cool special effects, the ravishing Ann Francis, and considering it was "just" a low budget B movie, a pretty stellar cast with Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielson, and as I said Ann Francis--to produce one of the great B sci-fi movies of the period, and one which really transcends the modest pretentions of that oft-maligned genre. And last but not least, the scene with the I.Q. measuring machine even pokes fun at the captain. :-)<br /><br />Then there was Robbie the robot, who went on to appear in several other venues (including a very corny Lost in Space episode some years later, but I guess Robbie's career was on the skids by that time :-)). The movie's climax is exciting as well as different from the other sci-fi movies of the day, but I won't say anything further on that so as not to provide any spoilers, except to say that it had more do to with inner space than outer space. And finally, the energy ray gun and the flying saucer spaceship are two very cool special effects. All in all still a great classic from the golden age of B science fiction movies and still worth watching today.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>If you like sci-fi movies then this is a must have one. A true classic. Although this edition is quite expensive (I had an earlier version) the extras offered were worth it. The little robot and the (small) lobby cards are worth having.

I wish there were similar editions for other classic movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>Hey, most of us know that Forbidden Planet is quite likely the most influential sci-fi movie in history, and rightly so.  (In fact, I remember back in the early 1990's when DVDs first started appearing in stores, and Forbidden Planet was one of the very first movies to go onto DVD.)<br /><br />I ordered this 50th anniversary edition as quickly as I could move my mouse and type, but it took me a few months to actually get around to watching it.<br /><br />I've seen this movie many times.  What I really was looking forward to was the bonus material that came with the movie.  All I can say is that the bonus features made it worth the price of purchasing the DVD set.<br /><br />First, the Additional Scenes are priceless.  I'd actually seen them before because I own the Criterion Collection laser disc (retailed for $100 ten years ago), but I don't have a laser disc player, so I finally got to see these scenes again on a media I can play whenever I want.  Cool!<br /><br />Second the "Lost Footage" is just about as priceless as the deleted scenes.  There's even an alternate introductory narrative where you hear the words "planet" and "federation" used together almost ten years before those words became legendary.<br /><br />The Excerpts from The MGM Parade TV Series are basically Walter Pidgeon advertising the movie at the end of this TV show.  Short, but can anything with Walter Pidgeon not be great?<br /><br />The All-new Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet" featurette is a rather good documentary.  I just wish it had been longer, but that's the way it goes.  Ann Francis looks amazingly good even to this day.<br /><br />The Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon was an unexpected surprise and very entertaining.  No, it's not the Lost in Space robot.  It's a different robot.  In fact, there's an episode of Lost in Space where both robots appear together.  I wish this documentary had shown us all the places where Robby appeared through the years.  Robby was in an original Twilight Zone episode (as were many of the props from Forbidden Planet) but no mention was made of this.<br /><br />So, the worst thing I can say about the documentaries is that there could have been more, but at least they're there.<br /><br />The TCM documentary Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us seemed like filler, but at least it puts Forbidden Planet in its historical context and illustrates just what a revolutionary movie it was.<br /><br />The Invisible Boy is a barely watchable (unless you just love Mystery Science Theater type corny sci-fi) movie that features the same robot coincidentally (yeah right) named Robby.  In this movie, Robby is evil, and the boy is about the most loathsome and unlikeable boy ever to star in any sci-fi movie I've seen.  I watched this movie on my flat panel TV during a treadmill workout, so at least I didn't waste any time.  If you want to see Robby do evil things and speak with a bad voice, watch this.<br /><br />I haven't watched the Thin Man TV Series Robot Client episode yet.<br /><br />So, there's an overview of the bonus features.  I hope it helps your purchase decision.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>this will be a classic 100 years from now<br /><br />I love it more and more every time I watch it<br /><br />it has such a great space age vibe to it<br /><br />very powerful<br /><br />see this movie<br /><br />truly a classic<br /><br />even if it is 30 or 40 years old it shall stay a classic</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>I was speechless when I saw this last night!

But in addition we have a good script AND good actors; I mean - Walter Pidgeon of Mrs. Miniver fame and a hero that is not really heroic(Leslie Nielsen)...????<br /><br />A MASTERPIECE</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>4.5 stars. Nearly fifty years later it is truly amazing how fresh this movie still looks and feels.  I have always believed the primary component of any lasting film is a great story.  As a child I was as mesmerized by this film as much as I was with "Star Wars."  The script is both highly intelligent and highly entertaining, with much more humor and believable horror than one would expect from a 1956 film.  The direction is polished and inventive, with arcing tracking shots and clever editing techniques strewn throughout the picture.  The acting here is very good, with a defining performance from Walter Pidgeon as Doctor Morbius, and a surprising dramatic turn from later-day comic actor Leslie Nielsen.  The supporting cast all shine, each one containing more depth of character than is normally given to secondary roles.  There is a tidy ending where a chain-reaction is started by merely turning a disc then throwing a switch, with irreversible effects.  A Master Race of beings create a machine 20-miles-squared that can be destroyed that easily?  Not likely.  Regardless, this is still one of the best Sci-fi films from the 1950s.  Thank you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>There are three sci-fi film essentials: Fritz Lang's "Metropolis,"  "The Day the Earth Stood Still," and "Forbidden Planet."  There three films defined science fiction, as we know it today.  "Forbidden Planet," for example, is the father of the Star Trek franchise, and the sets provided the basis for "Lost in Space."  And look at all of Robby the Robots grandchildren!<p>This film is a science fiction rewrite of  "The Tempest," which helps explain its sticking power.  It has the rescue vessel, the mad scientist, and the alien mysteries, all of which capture your interest and never let you go. IT has elements of a murder mystery, with hilarious subplots about a na?ve young girl and hungry boys lucked up in psace for a year.  IS it 1950's cheese?  Yes, but it is fun to watch.<p>The killer is an invisible villain.  Aside from being cheaper, this builds the suspense to an incredible level.  Come on-you see "Alien" and you see a lanky guy in a rubber suit. But an invisible villain lets your imagination run wild, which can be wilder than anything Hollywood can ever make.<p>The situation of a scientific-research vessel that discovers now life and new civilization provides the pattern for Star Trek:  the main characters being the Captain, the ship's doctor and the engineer interacting.  Leslie Neilson has the same soul as William Shatner.  For good or bad, there is no Star Trek equivalent of Robby the Robot, unless you count Mr. Spock.  But I digress.<p>Another observation is Altair's insidious wardrobe changing, which preempts Queen Amildala by five decades.  Walter Pidgeon gives a masterful performance, and steals the show.  So many mad scientists are flat and soulless-they are even passionless went it comes to their passions in science.  But Pidgeon breathes life in what could have been a cheesy 1950's science fiction throwaway.<p>The costuming and sets are superb.  True this is 1950, so some of the sets look like they were done with Crayolas, but can any "cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?"  The doorways in the film give you the weird impression of alien civilization. The lab and Krell building blow your mind with all of the gizmos. Nothing specific, but the overall atmosphere suggests things alien.  I wonder if they actually had an image of the Krell, or if they just made it up as they went along the image you see haloed in laser-fire may be a Krell, or may be the Krell equivalent of a Frankenstein's monster.  The plaster cast of the monster's foot suggests that the monster is an imaginary composite, but we will never know. By the way, the idea that a civilization would not have pictures is not weird ay all-Islamic art does not allow for graven images to be made, so they focus on Arabic calligraphy.  .<p>The soundtrack is theremin based-the eerie "oooh"-making machine from the Beach Boy's song "Good Vibrations."  It adds to the weirdness of the movie, and is comparable to the soundtrack in the 1981 remake of  "Flash Gordon."  Most experimental soundtracks flop, but this comes off perfectly, since it is suggested that the music we a re listening to is actually Krell music.<p>The DVD is an annoying two-sided disc with letterbox and "pan and scan" on each side.  People-Wide screen, wide screen, wide screen!<p>Two parting thoughts:<p>First, at the heart of this movie is a psycho-thriller that brings your mind to the edge as you are forced to look at yourself.  We have the technology and the power to be gods, but can we stand it if in our hearts, we are devils?  Look at this war we are fighting.<p>Second, if this film seems familiar, it is because everyone has ripped it off.  You do not counterfeit a worthless coin.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>The initial reason I took a look at `Forbidden Planet' was because I'd heard that it influenced both Gene Roddenberry when he developed  `Star Trek', and George Lucas when he was conceptualizing the `Star Wars' saga. Any movie that was an inspiration to the two biggest sci-fi franchises of all time (and two of my faves) is definitely worth a viewing!<br /><br /> After growing up watching `Airplane!' and `The Naked Gun', it's kinda strange seeing Leslie Nielsen play a more-serious role as the ship's commander. No double-takes in reaction to strange sight gags? No droll one-liners with the straightest face one can imagine? Definitely something I'm not used to...<br /><br />Then there's the introduction of one of sci-fi's ultimate legends- Robby the Robot! Being one of the more fortunate cast-members of this little adventure, Robby would make many subsequent appearances through the decades in TV-Land, including a throw-down with the `Lost In Space' robot, and staying over at Mork's place for a few days. I think he's hanging out in some Hollywood museum somewhere nowadays. If anybody knows where Robby's hangin' out nowadays, let me know!<br /><br />Although I'm not an absolutist when it comes to movies in the widescreen, there are exceptions. This movie in particular is one of them. I remember two particular scenes- Robby giving a monkey a bit of a zap to make him behave, and the Cap'n having to vaporize a tiger- that went the full width of the screen, and looked really weird when the studio panned &amp; scanned it for the VHS release. In this case, for maximum cinema enjoyment, wider IS better!<br /><br />`Late</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>FORBIDDEN PLANET is certainly one of the most influential films of the 20th Century, containing an unusual story line, some remarkable concept art designs, a superior musical score, and a special effects robot that set the standard for science-fiction films for some thirty years and still continues to influence film makers today.  Unfortunately, the film is also a very static one, ultimately less interesting for any sense of excitement than for purely visual appeal.<p>In general, the story--which is famous for being very loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST--concerns a deep space mission helmed by Leslie Nielson sent to relieve colonists of a distant planet. Upon arriving, they find only two survivors: an inhospitable Walter Pidgeon and his beautiful daughter Anne Francis.  Pidgeon warns the relief mission against landing on the planet, lest the mysterious and evil force that destroyed the original colonists be once more unleashed, but land they do... and soon they too fall victim to an unseen but fearsome killer.<p>There are many marvelous things about the film.  The robot--suggested by Shakespeare's character Ariel--is truly the single most enjoyable element of the film, with much of the film's best lines and a memorable personality to boot.  Anne Francis--again suggested by Shakespeare's Miranda--gives quite a remarkable performance as a beautiful young woman raised without knowledge of mankind.  The art designs, whether of the lost alien civilization, the home in which Pideon and Francis live, or Francis' costumes, are stunning.  Even so...<p>Perhaps it is more a matter of passing time than anything else.  Both Nielson and Pidgeon's performances seem unnecessarily restrained and the cinematography is extremely static. The film as a whole seems to lack excitement and, although intriguing, the story itself is handled in a very conventional way.  Fans of classic science fiction cannot afford to be without FORBIDDEN PLANET, and most viewers will enjoy seeing it at least once, but for all its influence and visual beauty many may find that one viewing is enough.<p>Word of Warning: make absolutely certain that you are purchasing the widescreen version of the film, for the pan-and-scan seriously undercuts the film's visual appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>While somewhat primitive based on what we see today, the special effects and sets created for this sci-fi classic raised the bar for the genre.  For a more accurate comparison, look at some of the other films of the day.  Before Leslie Nielsen became the go-to guy for comedic parodies, he was a serious actor and yes, this is a serious film. Ann Francis plays his romantic interest and wears short "futuristic" outfits that, as Steven Spielberg says, "makes you wish she were your babysitter" when watching this movie as a kid. Both Nielsen and Francis died recently.  The story involves a team of space travelers from Earth in the 23rd century who is on a mission to find a research party that has not been heard from.  Upon arrival at the planet Altair-4, they are met by the lone survivors, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon adding credibility to the role) and his winsome daughter, Alta (Francis).  The rest of the party has been killed by an alien creature decades earlier.  Morbius has discovered a new race that ruled for thousands of centuries only to disappear overnight.  The seemingly undefeatable creature comes back again, and the Shakespearian plot thickens.  Sure, the film has its share of cheese but it is easily offset by a more serious look at our inner selves.  Perhaps more important is that "Forbidden Planet" took a serious look at science fiction in film and set the stage for Star Trek, Star Wars and others to follow.  As an aside, the Blu ray package includes a terrific TCM documentary "Watch the Skies!" about sci-fi films of the 50's featuring interviews with the aforementioned Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron and Ridley Scott.  These guys know their film history and really get excited about these science fiction classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>This was cutting edge SCI FI in its time and surprising holds up rather well even today.  Though back then we thought of Leslie Nelson as a very serious dramatic actor.  Now after Police Squad and Mr. Magoo, it somehow takes on a slightly different light, making you wish they included the out-takes!!!<p>It is great to see this classic in such clean crisp form!  Based on Shakespear!!!<p>A must for every collector!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>I admit I had never heard of this movie before. I did recignise the robot from it's cameo appearences since (Well, Gremlins, anyway)<br /><br />I usualy sit down and look at these old films and laugh at how bad they are, or how there ideas of the future are so laughable, or the really s####y SFX they had. But I actualy can not do that to this movie! I was actualy impressed at how they did some of the effects for this. Even tho I can tell they where drawn is as a cartoon, they are done exceptionly well for a 1956 film.<br /><br />The only thing I laughed at was Leslie Nielson looking so young! It was weird watchign him do strait acting, but after a while I got into it. I can see why it's a classic easily. I could even instantly see that Lost In Space ripped it off quite a bit.<br /><br />It wont suprise me to see this movie being re-made in the near future. It starts well, continues well, and ends well. All 3 elements of making a good film. With some respectable SFX thrown in for extra enjoyment. Campy, but enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>This is a remarkable movie in many ways. It is a veritable Sci-fi Classic of the `50s, over par of class-B and very innovative with tremendous special effects.<br /><br />I've seen it when I was just in my early teens and now when I saw it again still remembered some features as the footprint of the invisible monster and the lovely Altaira and her short skirted dresses.<br /><br />This is the plot: a starship from the Earth comes to rescue a long lost scientific expedition. They are received by Dr. Morbius, the only survivor and Altaira his daughter, born on the planet, being her mother a deceased fellow investigator of Dr. Morbius. He states he doesn't need to be rescued and interrupt his fascinating investigation of a lost planetary civilization: the Krells.<br /><br />Due to this civilization, Commander Adams declares he needs to consult Earth authorities as to what to do. That means he must stay at least two weeks and partially dissemble his ship in order to build a huge transmitter. Dr. Morbius offer the aid of Robby his multitask robot, (a remarkable creation of the film makers that fascinated the audience of the times). While Adams and his crew are performing this task they are attacked by an invisible monster that destroys essential equipment.<br />Adams order an electrical perimeter to be erected around the ship and next night they are attacked by the alien monster rendered half visible by the fence. The monster retires after killing some crew members. From here on the film reaches its climax.<br /><br />There are no big stars in the cast; nevertheless playacting is correct and convincing. Anne Francis composes a lovely na?ve girl, Leslie Nielsen correctly fleshes Commander Adams and veteran Walter Pigeon is Dr. Moribius.<br /><br />The outstanding items of the movie are the special effects, really over par for 1956 and the story, intelligent and thought provoking.<br /><br />This is a film that will be enjoyed by classic sci-fi fans and general public too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>"Forbidden Planet" is not just another space-monster film.  The film introduces the concept of hyperdrive as a means of traveling faster than light, and overall the story is thoughtful, and contains numerous twists that add zip to the story.<br /><br />This one was far ahead of its time, and still helps set the standard for space opera science fiction.  Recommended.

Since this movie is based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, a book I never read, I cannot do a compare and contrast. In the movie, you can see some effects that Star Trek used in its television show. Basically the movie is set in the year 2200 and a group of soldies is sent to the planet Altair IV to find out what happen to a group of scientists who try to colonize the planet 20 years ago. Once the expedition reaches the planet reaches the planet the find the three remaining survivors. Robby The Robot, Dr. Edward Morbius, and Altaira "Alta" Morbius. Murders start turning up when an invsible creature start attacking the crew. The movie does have some laughs and tries to make a statement. I would recommend this movie to any. Just for the special effects alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>When one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white B films that were parodied on the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 television show. Yet, while there were far more films like Plan 9 From Outer Space and Robot Monster than good films, the 1950s did have some very good, if not great, science fiction films like The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, War Of The Worlds, and The Thing From Another World. Yet, the best of the bunch, for its literacy and production values, was undoubtedly MGM's first big foray into A level science fiction, Forbidden Planet, released in 1956. It was a 98 minute color film, directed by Fred M. Wilcox, that featured then state of the art special effects, and was endowed with a very good screenplay by Cyril Hume, from a screen treatment called Fatal Planet, by Irving Block and Allen Adler, who adapted aspects of William Shakespeare's The Tempest into it.<br />  The film drew raves when it was released, for its Oscar nominated special effects, its all electronic music score, by Louis and Bebe Barron (although credited as Electronic Tonalities, to avoid music guild fees), vivid matte paintings- inspired by Chesley Bonestell, and the famed Monster Of The Id (MOTI), which was animated by an animator, Joshua Meador, on loan from the Walt Disney studio. Even more famous was the appearance of Robby The Robot, in his first role in either film or television. Later he would appear in the film The Invisible Boy- included in this DVD as a bonus, as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, and Lost In Space- with whose own robot he is often confused, and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film Gremlins.<br />  The tale is simple, but elegantly constructed, and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced `love story' aspect in the film. In the 23rd Century, the United Planets Cruiser C-57D- a flying saucer, led by Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his Police Squad days), is en route to the planet Altair IV, to investigate what happened to the crew of the Bellerophon, sent to the planet twenty years earlier. After a year's journey, there they encounter the lone survivor of the party, Doctor Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), the Prospero stand-in- a philologist, his gorgeous blond daughter Altaira (Anne Francis)- the Miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt, and Robby the Robot, the domestic servant who is the Calibanian counterpart. Morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the Bellerophon party in their first year, yet he was immune to it.... All in all, it's a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings, and the absurdity of the adult reactions to Timmy's and Robby's exploits borders an Dalian surreal absurdity. Yet, it's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures, for it's played straight, thus making it even funnier. As for the main feature? Forbidden Planet deserves all its kudos. It's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than Star Wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. Only such films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Alien and Aliens, and the first two Terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.<br />  It's worth knowing that, despite Forbidden Planet's `happy ending', there is the possibility that the MOTI is still dormant within Alta, as well. After all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the MOTI attacked the ship a second time. Also, the film wisely only `shows' the MOTI once, and never shows the Krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. The film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. Forbidden Planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious Cold War allegories. Watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. But, even if you don't, there's still the scene of Anne Francis skinnydipping. That alone is timeless.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>For MGM this was a major "A" when it was released -- something they wouldn't do again until the late 1960's with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. This was an obvious influence on shows like Star Trek and Lost in Space.  Leslie Nielson in his leading man days, the ever beautiful Anne Francis, Walter Pigeon, Jack Kelly (pre-Maverick), a very young Earl Holliman (Police Woman), Richard Anderson (Oscar Goldman on The Six Million Dollar Man and not to be confused with Richard DEAN Anderson of McGyver fame).  Then again, who can forget Robbie the Robot, the magnificent Krell machines and a plot based on The Bard's "The Tempest".</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>Shakespeare's "Tempest" is the model for this exceptional science fiction film. I looked for differences. Prospero and Miranda are stranded on a Mediterranean island. Morbius and his daughter are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair. Ariel is a spirit. Robby the Robot is a man-made servant. Caliban's evil does not match that of Monsters of the Id. Shakespeare spares Prospero. Morbius dies when Altair 4 blows up. We wonder if mankind will suffer the same fate as the Krell.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>As everything good has already been said about this grand old film I will only comment on the quality of the video transfer. I never saw this film in the theaters but have been told that it was quite a sight to behold on the wide screen in glorious color. I watched this recent DVD on a 50" wide screen plasma HDTV and the wide screen screen color presentation lived up to the reputation of the film.  The transfer quality was excellent!  Many wonderful extras included with the DVD (see other reviews).</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is one of those wonderful works of science fiction:  it both stretches the imagination and reflects the time in which it was made.  The plot revolves around a rescue mission, to a colony that has been silent for 20 years.  Upon arrival, the crew discover a series of mysteries:  while nearly the entire original crew was mysteriously murdered, a single man (Morbius) was miraculously immune, as was his daughter.  The survivors are served by a fantastic robot, Robby, one the original scifi creations that I remember as a child, who is far beyond the science of man to create.  Then there is the hidden menace, which slowly reveals itself as a being that seems to defy the laws of physics.<br /><br />Morbius, of course, is the key to these mysteries, but he is stubborn and convinced of his moral rectitiude as he chooses himself as the guardian of an ancient extraterrestrial culture.  A fateful battle of wills follows with the captain, for whom Morbius' daughter has fallen.  The solution to all the mysteries come together in a wonderfully unforeseen conclusion, which surprises as well as reflects the then-popular Freudian psychanalysis of the time.  It is simply brilliant, both in its themes and its technical execution.  This story will live in my imagination for my entire life.  It is still worth seeing.<br /><br />Warmest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Commander J. J.

Upon arrival, Adams and company find only one man named Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis- one of the sexiest women in ANY galaxy) alive. Morbius explains that the others were killed by some strange, unseen force. Morbius is a solemn, mysterious sort of guy himself, and it's apparent that he's not telling the whole truth. He's built a virtual paradise in the middle of a wasteland, complete with a forest, deer, and a tiger. Morbius also has a robot named Robby, who does all of the menial labor around the stellar estate. Adams and his men soon learn that all is not well on Altair 4. An unstoppable, invisible entity is unleashed, tearing crewmembers to pieces, while absorbing their laser blasts into it's incredible mass. Adams and his first mate learn that Morbius has tapped into a vast computer network (about the size of Cleveland), left behind by a now extinct race of super-beings called "the Krell". Somehow, using this network, Morbius can release his "id" to do his insane bidding. Will anyone be going back to earth at all? Can the invisible horror be defeated? Will Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis live on to star together again in Funny Girl with Barbra Streisand? Watch and see.

'Doc' Ostrow (Warren Stevens) of the United Planets Cruiser C-57-D after it arrived at the planet Altair IV. The C-57-D, commanded by Commander John F. Adams (Leslie Nielsen), was sent to Altair IV from Earth to rescue a colony sent there two decades earlier on the spaceship Belleraphon because all contact was lost shortly thereafter.  When the C-57-D arrived at Altair IV, they received a warning from philologist Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pigeon) that they should not land.  He also claimed to be the lone survivor of the doomed Belleraphon.  However, Commander Adams had his orders and the C-57-D landed on Altair IV in spite of Dr. Morbius' objections.  After landing, Dr. Morbius and his robotic companion Robby (Robot the Robot) greeted the C-57-D crew, but Dr. Morbius continued to insist that they should leave immediately.  Unexpectedly, a beautiful woman, Altaira (Anne Francis), appears.  She is Dr. Morbius' daughter, whom he had ordered not to be seen while the C-57-D crew was on the surface.  The crew is delighted to meet Altaira, who have not seen a woman for 378 days while en route to Altair IV, but they were also surprised because she was not listed on the Belleraphon's passenger manifest.  Dr. Morbius explained that he was married by the Belleraphon captain, but that his wife died on the planet shortly after giving birth to Altaira.<p>Altaira was not the only thing that Dr. Morbius planned to hide from the spaceship visiting from Earth: he also had no intention of revealing Altair IV's biggest secret, but Commander Adams and Doc Ostrow forced the issue.  Reluctantly, Dr. Morbius explained that a race far more intellectually and techonologically advance than mankind, the Krell, once inhabited Altair IV.  Sadly, for hitherto unknown reasons, the Krell became extinct virtually over night as well as all other life on the planet 200,000 years earlier; but not all of the Krell's secrets had been lost.  As foretold by Dr. Morbius, strange things begin to happen to the visiting spaceship and crew similar to what ultimately destroyed the Belleraphon; and the isolated peace that Dr. Morbius and Altaira knew on the dead planet before the spaceship's arrival evaporates.<p>Taking inspiration from William Shakespeare's play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, writers Irving Block and Allen Adler created a brilliant story for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  The Duke Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; became Dr. Morbius, his daughter Miranda became Altaira, the enslaved spirit Ariel became Robby the Robot, Ferdinand became Commander Adams, the island of exile became the planet Altair IV and Caliban became a monster bent on destruction.<p>Under the direction of Fred M. Wilcox, the acting, dialog and special effects for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; greatly surpasses nearly all other sci-fi films produced in the 1950's and 1960's.  Having been twice previously nominated for Best Actor in 1942 for &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; and in 1943 for &quot;Madame Curie&quot;, Walter Pigeon's portrayal of Dr. Morbius was exceptional.  &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; received a 1956 Oscar nomination for Best Special Effects, but lost to the only other nominated film, Cecil B. DeMille's &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.  It was not until Stanley Kubrick filmed &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in 1968 that a sci-fi film surpassed &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; in quality and achievement.  The few films comparable to &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; from the 1950's include &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (1953).<p>Time has not caused &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to lose any of its excellence. Sci-fi fans more accustomed to modern computer-enhanced special effects may regard the effects used in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to be dated, but most will more than likely come to appreciate what Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was able to achieve with 1950's film technology.  For example, some may be surprised to see that George Lucas (in his 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;) was not the first to show what a holographic image could look like, as demonstrated in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  Some may also be surprised to see Leslie Nielsen portray a serious character, instead of his more recent, bumbling comedic characters in films such as &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988).  Overall, I give &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; a highly deserved 5 out of 5 stars, as it will always be a timeless, landmark sci-fi film warning us to always beware of monsters from the id!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>In the 23rd century a rescue ship is sent to the planet Altar to look for survivors of an earlier expatiation.

As far as the movie goes, I liked it very much.  But considering it is still considered a classic some 50 years later, you probably already knew it was good.<br /><br />I'm also not a techie, but after discovering the magic of blu ray I haven't turned back and have become somewhat of a 1080p snob.  If it's not blu, I don't watch it.  So I feel fairly confident when I say that I thought the picture quality was outstanding.  I've seen great transfers and I've seen some alright transfers, Forbidden Planet probably wasn't at the top, but it wasn't anywhere close to the bottom.<br /><br />The dark void of space was crisp and vivid and Anne Francis' marvelous short dresses dazzle with color.  In fact, the picture quality was so clear that I could (unfortunately) see that Anne was wearing a skin-colored suit as she started to emerge from the pond.  For some fans, no doubt, this might be considered a bad thing.<br /><br />Likewise the audio was sharp and clear, a lossless 5.1 DTS-HD MA release that won't test your system but it will greatly enhance the classic movie watching experience.<br /><br />All in all, I'm so glad I was able to take part in watching a Hollywood classic with today's amazing HD technology.  I can see now why it was influential enough for The Rocky Horror Picture Show to reference it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FFYQZPUGOX58.html">A2FFYQZPUGOX58</a><br/><p>If you already have a DVD of "Forbidden Planet," should you buy the Blu-ray version?<br /><br />I have watched the DVD version of this many times; it is the "50th Anniversary Two-Disc Special Edition."  I consider its picture quality as excellent (4).<br /><br />The picture quality for the Blu-ray version is the same.  When watching it, there were moments when I thought it might show a tiny bit more detail.  To make this an objective evaluation of its resolution versus the older DVD version, I picked out two scenes with difficult-to-resolve detail.<br /><br />In Dr. Morbius's study there is a blackboard.  Upon it he has chalked a diagram of the enigmatic pointed arches, Einstein's famous energy equation, other equations with possibly alien mathematical operators and symbols, and a drawing of the celestial sphere marking altitude and azimuth of something.  On this last item, there is a word written in capitol letters:  on the DVD, it is unreadable;  on the Blu-ray, it reads, "EQUINOCTIAL".<br /><br />In the chamber with the plastic educator, there are several blue panels in the distant background behind the educator.  In the scene where Doc Ostrow is seated at the educator:  on the DVD, the panels have no detail;  on the Blu-ray, the panels are perforated like a pegboard.<br /><br />If you want the best possible resolution, then this Blu-ray is it; however, since the differences are so minute, I suspect most will be satisfied with their DVD version.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is outstanding (5).  Its story has mystery and an ample supply of wonder.  Visually, the scenes on the surface of Altair-4 are believably alien.  And once you have heard the eerie soundtrack; you will never forget it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Forbidden Planet was based on Shakespeare's The Tempest.  Well, saying that Forbidden Planet was based on The Tempest is like saying Silver Streak was based on Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.  It would be better to say Forbidden Planet was inspired by The Tempest.<br /><br />Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) headed a doomed scientific party twenty years prior to the planet Altair-4.  A rescue party has been sent to find their fate.  It is headed by the dashing Captain Adams (Leslie Nielsen - yes at one time Leslie was dashing.)  Morbius warns off Adams but Adams is determined to find out the fate of the expedition.<br /><br />Morbius tells him that all died from a strange monster, all except he and his wife.  Oh and his beautiful daughter, Altaira (Anne Francis).  The entire crew falls for Altaira including the Captain.  Little by little the secrets of the planet, its extinct race, the Krells, and the monster are revealed.  We also have the first famous robot, Robbie, the Robot.<br /><br />Pidgeon is most famous for his series of films with Greer Garson, including the Oscar winner Mrs. Miniver.  But when she retired, so did his career (and that was a shame as he is a great actor).  This was a chance for him to headline a film.  He created a niche for himself that would give him quality films until he retired.  By the way he reunited with Anne Francis, sort of, in Funny Girl.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was up and comers.  Most found their success in television.  Anne Francis became Honey West.  Leslie Nielsen is most associated with Police Squad.  Jack Kelly was one of the Mavericks.  Richard Anderson was the boss of The Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman.  Earl Holliman was boss to Police Woman.  James Drury was The Virginian.  So as you can see, there are a lot of familiar faces here.<br /><br />The production quality is a bit cheesy but this was really the first true outer space film and you have to forgive this.  The sets are great but they look like sets.  By today's standards, the visual effect are bland but you have to take it for the time that this was made.  The effects were state of the are for the 50's and extremely clean.  They blend very well with the scene, they do not look at all fake.<br /><br />As stated before, this is inspired by The Tempest.  The Tempest is on of my favorite Shakespeare plays but it is seldom staged and it has only been filmed for television.  It would increase your enjoyment of the film to see The Tempest.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: None</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL: THE SUSPENSE WILL KILL YOU -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ON ALTAIR-4!<br /><br />This very modern looking and well-made film stikes an emotional cord in many viewers and on multiple levels. To make this MGM classic Sci-Fi thriller from 1956 all the more convincing, there is an excellent cast and award winning special-effects, courtesy of Disney. We have love, rage and fear all playing at the same time and it is something to experience -- not just see.<br /><br />WHAT THE 'FORBIDDEN PLANET' IS ALL ABOUT: [some plot spoilers below]<br /><br />It's the 23rd century, and a United Planets Cruiser commanded Commander J.J. Adams [Leslie Nielsen] is on a rescue mission to the planet Altair-4. Apparently, the Earth spaceship Bellerophon vanished, 20 years earlier. The Bellerophon's destination was Altair-4. As we soon discover, there is only one survivor, Doctor Edward Morbius the ship's philologist.<br /><br />According to Webster's New World Dictionary a 'Philologist' is a 'Linguist', 'Scholar', 'grammarian' or 'lexicographer'. This is significant because what Morbius has discovered on Altair-4 will certainly need both a scholar and a linguist to unravel.<br /><br />Strangely and even rudely, Morbius wants no part of any rescue which of course makes Adams very suspicious and they land on Altair-4. What follows is what the film is all about.<br /><br />THE UNSEEN CAN BE VERY SCARY -<br /><br />As the story unfolds, with the help of excellent special effects, especially for 1956, we learn about the disposition of the rest of Morbius's lost crew and find that he has a daughter too. The two are all that have somehow survived some kind of "planetary force". As Adams and his crew remain to investigate and to await orders from Earth, that "planetary force" somehow returns to wreck havoc. If havoc isn't enough then perhaps some fatalities will get Adams to pack it in and scram.<br /><br />BUT WHERE IS THIS FORCE COMING FROM -<br /><br />Remember, I did say it was scary, it is, especially if you allow your imagination to run away a bit. As time goes by, the force becomes more determined [apparently] and Morbius becomes more disturbed. We learn of an ancient civilization called the Krell, that has become extinct and how this has been a source of major technological innovations that are now part of Morbius's household -- like 'Robby the Robot'. How did Morbius build Robby and what is it that we just don't see? There is a monster in this film and it is about as scary a monster as there ever was, literally indestructible and eternal.<br /><br />SO THE FORBIDDEN PLANET IS A MYSTERY TOO!<br /><br />Just what is this 'Planetary Froce', who controls it and what is the motivation for it is the mystery. As the film proceeds, the emotions: some of love, some of rage and some of frustration are building as they might within a pressure cooker. Here, the pacing of the film really helps to build the suspense, tension and fear. Yes, this can be a scary film. I thought so 50 years ago and still do today after hundreds of viewings.<br /><br /> ***** THE MAJOR PLAYERS *****<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon  - Dr. Edward Morbius<br /><br />Anne Francis  - Alta Morbius<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen  - Commander John J.

Thankfully, this [widescreen VHS] version has them. One scene is not important and involves a pet monkey being shot with an electrical charge to keep him from eating a banana which was on the dining room table in Mobius's home. The other and more significant scene occurs during Morbius's little lecture, and show and tell session with Adams and Dr. Ostrow [Warren Stevens] in the underground Krell facility. The specific scene is where Morbius tells Adams to fire his blaster at the Krell metal. Adams does so and he and Dr. Ostrow are amazed to find that the metal isn't warm after being subjected to their weapon. I always felt badly that this scene was missing as it ties into what happens in the end by demonstrating how impervious Krell metal is to melting, even when fired at by 23rd century blasters [particle beam blaster].<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A TRUE SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT IS 5-STARS IN 1956 & 2006<br /><br />This is from beginning to end and very compelling film that has aged very well and is still chilling to watch. It is an excellent story, has a well played cast, modern effects and great pacing that leads to a dramatic conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The Movie:<br /><br />I don't know how I went for 33 years without seeing this movie. I am a big science fiction aficionado, and a massive Star Trek fan in particular. Perhaps I had subconsciously lumped this film in with other 50's-era schlock. Well, I was in error to do so.<br /><br />As a Trek fanatic, it was fascinating to see a film from 1956 which was so obviously a huge inspiration for Gene Roddenberry's original series. So many aspects of this film find their way into Roddenberry's TV show:<br />-a "United Earth" space vessel that travels faster than light<br />-a transporter-like deceleration chamber,<br />-the storyline of checking on a missing survey team<br />-an ancient civilization that had evolved to the point of non-corporeal being<br />-brain scanners which impart huge loads of information directly into the minds of the recipient<br /><br />These are but a few of the similarities, the most impressive of which might be the tonal similarity: the sense of seriousness and wonder at space exploration, mixed with just enough humor and sex appeal to keep things moving breezily.<br /><br />But more than just a preview for the Star Trek show that would emerge a decade later, we also get a good story with a fine emotional core, adapted very loosely from Shakespeare's "Tempest" - a reclusive scientist (like Shakespeare's wizard), living on a secluded world with only his daughter for company, who fears losing her to visitors from far away. I won't spoil the secret we eventually learn about this scientist, but suffice it to say, it is an excellent science fiction concept which is well-fleshed out.<br /><br />The performances are all good, and the actors clearly took the material seriously. Particularly good are Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius, and Anne Francis as his daughter Alta. Leslie Nielsen cuts a fine figure as the square-jawed commander of the ship, too.<br /><br />The effects are also surprisingly good for a film of this day. Yes, we can tell with our modern eyes when optical effects, matte painted backdrops, and models are being used. But the level of execution in this definitely out-shines the original Star Trek TV series from a decade later, and was probably not surpassed in quality until Kubrick's "2001" in 1968. The set designs are also terrific, with extremely detailed props.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a seminal film, in the fullest possible sense of the word - it set an extremely high standard for the genre, and certainly gave birth to future greats like Star Trek. If you're a Trek fan, I consider this a must-own. If you're a student of the genre, this is equally necessary. But not only sci-fi nerds need apply - this is an interesting story with a lot of intelligence, but also a good amount of drama and heart. Just about anyone should be capable of being entertained by this - it's simply a good movie.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />For a 54 year-old movie, this transfer is stunningly good. Warner Bros. has scored again with a classic film transfer. Detail is not as strong as some modern films, but there is a lovely sheen of film grain that never wavers. Colors and black levels are stable and strong throughout. And detail can be quite good at times. Certainly, no DVD could reach the levels of detail present here. Cloth textures can be quite lovely, and fine hair and facial wrinkle detail is evident. Alta's outfits are particularly nice to look at, with lots of fine cloth detail and sparkling jewels.<br /><br />What really impresses are the slate of extras, all included on one dual-layer Blu-Ray disc. We get a complete 90-minute second movie, the standard def, black and white film "The Invisible Boy," featuring Robby the robot. A complete 25-minute episode of "The Thin Man" TV series is also included, featuring Robby. An hour-long (!) documentary from Turner Classic Movies delves into the culture of 50's sci-fi movies, with interviews of current sci-fi directors like Ridley Scott, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and James Cameron, and clips from dozens of contemporary 50's genre flicks. Then, we also get two featurettes, running 29 and 14 minutes respectively, looking at the production of the film and the construction of Robby the Robot. Some other vintage TV excerpts show Walter Pidgeon introducing Robbie to the home audience. 20 minutes of deleted scenes and "lost footage" rounds out a truly impressive collection of extras.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I was impressed in every way imaginable by this release. The film stands up with classics like "The Day The Earth Stood Still" and "2001" as genre must-owns. The Blu-Ray itself displays a superb quality of video, delivering both as very good high-definition as well as an accurate, film-like presentation of a cinema classic. The extras are truly exceptional, way more comprehensive than the average catalog release.<br /><br />This is truly a stellar (heh, heh) release. I can't recommend it enough. I anticipate getting MANY viewings out of this title for years to come, and look forward to passing on this film classic to the next generation as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>In 1956 MGM released Fred Wilcox's Forbidden Planet. Originally conceived as a B-movie the film has taken on a personality and a cult status that brands it as one of the most unique American films made. The film has been the inspiration for Star Wars and Star Trek and just about every modern space opera references it.<br /><br />The story is not a simple one and a great deal of Cyril Hume's screenplay is exposition that manages to take somewhat complex themes and make them accessible to a Saturday afternoon audience. A space cruiser piloted by Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) lands on the planet Altair 4 and meets the mysterious  Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira ( Anne Francis). Morbius is studying the artifacts of a strange civilization called the Krells. The Krell civilization was incredibily advanced. It had wiped out war, disease and had explored the universe 2000 centuries ago before it was itself wiped out.<br /><br />The story is a reworking of Shakespeare's The Tempest and the story hold up quite well after 52 years. The special effects were amazing for the time period and the matte paintings used for the backgrounds still look fantastic. The film was nominated for the 1957 Oscar for best special effects.<br /><br />If there is a problem with Forbidden Planet it is that the story of Monsters of the Id is somewhat dated. The film needs to be seen for the special effects production that it was. It does not need to be analysed for its story telling ability.<br /><br />The edition I viewed was the single disc  released by Warner Brothers. There have been at least two editions released since mine came out and I understand are much more complete. The picture, while not perfect, is quite good. There are scratches and abundant markings for reel changes and the like but they do not really mar the viewing experience. The sound is a standard mono mix but is easy to understand. The disc does not feature any special features other than the trailer. The trailer features a floating yellow scroll that was duplicated to great effect in the Star Wars movies.<br /><br />Get yourself some popcorn pop this one in and enjoy the golden age of sci-fi moviemaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Forbidden Planet (Fred Wilcox, 1956)<br /><br />Interesting how much debate there is over whether this is a great film or not. I've been following it, admittedly halfheartedly, on the IMDB fora for about a month now. And both sides have some very good points. From the standpoint of moviemaking, it does wear its B-movie origins on its sleeve. The acting is competent at best and mawkish most of the time. The direction isn't awful, but it's certainly nothing inspiring (though this can be said of most sci-fi films; Alien and Bladerunner are the exception, not the rule). The script, which borrows liberally from both Shakespeare and Asimov, sounds more like a dime novel than either of its supposed forebears. Still, I can't deny that all that pales in comparison to the atmosphere that Fred Wilcox (Lassie Come Home) and his crew cooked up for this movie.<br /><br />The plot: Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen in his second big-screen role) and his rather small crew have travelled to a planet where a colony had set down twenty years before, never to be heard from again. When they get there, they discover the colony's sole survivor, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), and his beautiful daughter Altaira (Anne Francis). Unfortunately, they also discover something else-- the something else that killed the rest of the colonists.<br /><br />It's a pretty skinny plot, but you're not watching this movie for the plot. Much of what became standard, if not clich&eacute;, in the science fiction realm (thanks to the many knockoffs of this movie that followed, as well as the Twilight Zone television series, which reused many of the film's props and sets over the years) emerged here. And, yeah, a lot of it does look clich&eacute; now, especially if you're a big fan of Twilight Zone. But if you can think about it as a lot of tropes that had never, at the time, been seen before, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the magic here.  In fact, that so much of the film has become clich&eacute; in the ensuing four decades should tip you off to just how profoundly influential it's been. Couple that with the B-movie script-- and one thing you can say for B-movies, they were usually well-paced and fun, if shallow-- and the movie does still hold up very well after all this time. Bottom line, it's a lot of fun. ****</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>The DVD version of this classic film is a joy to watch. Fans of classic SF films probably already have it by now -- but if you don't, then get it at once.<p>The film features an extremely pre-_Naked Gun_ Leslie Nielsen as Captain J.J. Adams and the great Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius in what amounts to a space-age recasting of _The Tempest_. Any viewer of the original _Star Trek_ will recognize both the plot and the production values: the Mad Scientist and his Beautiful Daughter are the sole survivors of a human mission to Altair 4, where everybody else has been killed by a strange, alien power into which the Mad Scientist has managed to tap . . .<p>This film pretty much set the standard for what starship crews were supposed to look like. It also featured the very first all-electronic score in motion picture history. And of course there's Robby, the robot who was so obviously the model for the one in _Lost in Space_.<p>Don't miss this one. It's not just your typical 1950s SF thriller; for its time, its special effects were on the cutting edge and its plot was fairly ambitious.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>First off, those of you complaining about the stretched out video transfer need to educate yourselves on DVD. It's called anamorphic and allows more of the MPEG-2 video codec to be used for the picture itself in very widescreen formats. If you don't have a 16:9 television, you need to go into the video options menu of your DVD player (not the DVD's menu, mind you) and tell it you're using a 4:3 aspect ratio display. As for the color hues and sound, I don't own the DVD, so I can't say. Somehow I find it unlikely that a major studio's video mastering would be paltry, but who knows.<p>Now for the film itself: Forbidden Planet blew me away. Human beings in the future using flying saucers. Realistic jargon. Believable military behavior and procedures. Scenes that have been used in countless other sci-fi movies, including Total Recall and Star Wars. I even noticed that David Lynch copied some of the costumes and props for his version of Dune (uniforms, rifles, gun fire, onboard microphone handset, etc). Leslie Nielsen plays a very convincing captain of the military vessel. The crew is much more at ease with each other than you see in most science fiction where there's a command structure. Then, we have the stunning Anne Francis who's got a face to die for. The plot has excellent pacing and it never gives away too much too soon, even going so far as to never show us certain unnecessary elements at all. This is definitely a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>What could possibly be more iconic of 50s science fiction that Robbie the Robot? Throw in Anne Francis and there can no longer be any doubt: FORBIDDEN PLANET is THE icon.<br /><br />Its not too bad a movie for its time. A ship from earth is dispatched to check in on a colony that has been silent for far too long. Upon arrival, the crew of the ship learn that there is only one survivor of the original party, a Dr. Morbius. To keep him company, he has his daughter and a robot he built. To occupy his time, he studies the vanished civilization that one lived on the planet and builds miraculous devices such as the robot.<br /><br />Needless to say, the crew is a bit perturbed by Morbius's account of the deaths of the rest of his party. They were all violently killed by a strange beast who has not appeared in 20 years. The beast does re-appear, though, and starts to pick off members of the ship's crew. There is very limited time to figure out what is going on before all are dead. The secret lies within themselves.<br /><br />As with most such productions of this age, the science is laughable. The story is fun, though, and Anne sure was pretty!</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'Forbidden Planet' is an enjoyable science fiction film, even though the graphic and acting may seem dated.  As the film progresses, one will realize it is actually a study of human psychology.

Quite possibly the best sci-fi movie in the 50's!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>There are a handful of 1950's sci-fi movies that have a big reputation - "When Worlds Collide", "The Thing From Another World", "Forbidden Planet", and "The Day the Earth Stood Still". Unfortunately, only "The Day The Earth Stood Still" really stands up (except the robot).<br /><br />This movie has big concepts, and none of them work anymore, if they ever did. Part thriller, part drama, part mad-scientist melodrama. There are just too many things going on, and all of them "supposedly" explained in long-winded speeches that answer nothing.<br /><br />"Forbidden Planet" starts off looking much like Star Trek TOS, including the transporter. In reality, ST:TOS creator Gene Roddenberry admits this movie formed part of the basis for Star Trek. In a nutshell, a United Planets space cruiser captained by Leslie Nielsen lands on Altair, against the wishes of its inhabitant, Dr. Morbius, a remnant from a previous expedition. He and his 25 year old daughter (Anne Francis) are the only humans on the planet. There is also a robot called "Robbie", of course, similar to that of the "Lost in Space" series. The doctor reluctantly shows the others his discovery about an ancient extinct race called the Krell. The "big" ending is too weird and funny to be described.<br /><br />The entire robot aspect and the tasks he performs is just silly (in the "Lost In Space" vein). Earl Holliman's character of "Cookie" was put in for comedic effect - unfortunately most has to do with his dealings with the robot - including getting the robot to make bourbon - which only adds to the silliness.<br /><br />The actors are quite serious and for the most part are OK. Leslie Nielsen plays it straight. Anne Francis is entertaining as the daughter who is initially somewhat innocent and ignorant of sex. As might be guessed, the captain ends up with her.<br /><br />The sets are incredibly hokey. The all-electronic score does not help. Ambitious, atrociously fake special effects that probably were OK in 1956. Possibly the goofiest sci-fi movie ever. Don't get me wrong - this is a well-made and well-intentioned movie, but as with "When Worlds Collide" and "The Thing...", it is recommended only for a laugh.<br /><br />A further insult is that the robot is not accurately depicted on the DVD cover and he never holds anyone in his arms.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I'd seen this movie on TV a few times over the years and always meant to get myself a copy. The story does have it's plot holes but is still one of the best scifi movies out there, even if it is 50 years old now. Most of the movie actually makes sense! In one scene there's a hologram of Morbius' daughter Alta- it wasn't called a hologram (and wasn't due to be invented for years yet) but that's just a small example of the vision they had in creating this thing. Almost the only appearance complaint even after all this time is the look of some of the outdoors shots and a few of the Krell equipment scenes (in those days it was all handwork and models, no computer effects, so it all looks very well indeed).Any collection of science fiction ought to have it, maybe any film collection period.<br /><br />The Ultimate Collector's Edition came out recently so I decided to get that. The movie is supposed to have been remastered, the sound is great but I thought I saw a little color shifting sometimes, like the color adjustments weren't perfectly even. I didn't like "The Invisible Boy" very much (I think I saw part of it on TV years ago)- kind of a 12 year olds plotline, the Thin Man TV appearance of the Robot was more interesting. Forbidden Planet itself is the only thing on either disc that is captioned or subtitled- would've been nice to have that on some of the extra's.<br /><br />It was interesting to see how many of the cast/crew are still living- including the robot creator and the wife of the husband/wife sound FX team. Some of the deleted scenes and lost footage (most of this was just test shots) looked very interesting but none of that stuff was restored- some of it looked like it was a worn video of a worn piece of film it was so fuzzy or scratchy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>A liberal interpretation of William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, with a wee bit of Freudian psychology thrown into the mix, the 1956 science-fiction classic FORBIDDEN PLANET follows the crew of a United Planets Cruiser on a mission to the distant planet Altair IV, home to a once-thriving scientific colony that has been mysteriously incommunicado for some time.  <p>When the cruiser reaches Altair IV, Commander John J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) and his crew make radio contact with a Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), one of the hitherto &quot;missing&quot; colonists.  However, Morbius warns Adams to turn back, insisting that the crew will be in mortal danger if they touch down on the planet's surface. Adams orders his crew to land the ship anyway, of course, and they find that all the members of colony have perished save for three--Dr. Morbius, his curvaceous daughter Altaira (Anne Francis), and an intellectual robotic wunderkind named Robby.<p>Not satisfied with Morbius' explanation about what happened to the other colonists, Adams and his crew seek evidence that will either corroborate or discredit Morbius' story.  What they find is the remnants of the advanced alien race that inhabited the Altair IV aeons ago.  Could this hold the key that unlocks the mystery of the missing colonists?<p>Even after nearly half a century, FORBIDDEN PLANET remains both an interesting and thought-provoking film.  Not only does it offer a clever space-age interpretation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, the special FX are still eye-poppingly cool, even when faced off against the CGI FX of contemporary fare.  One of the best special FX in the film is, of course, Robby the Robot.  A very expensive prop for MGM to build, Robby stands at a height of 7-and-a-half feet and weighs about 300 pounds.  He has become one of the most popular robots in the history of films and television, and as such, he has made cameo appearances in such movies as 1984's GREMLINS and 2003's LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION and on television shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and LOST IN SPACE.<p>In addition to Robby, the three principal human actors in FORBIDDEN PLANET also contribute to the film's success.  Leslie Nielsen is well known to film buffs as the comic star of such films as THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD (1988) and SPY HARD (1996).  But here he does an excellent job in a serious role as John J. Adams, the commander of the spaceship, and for modern audiences, then, there is this added treat of seeing Nielson play one of the stodgy establishment types that he is now famous for parodying.  The deep-voiced Walter Pidgeon is a masterful old-school thespian who is also a delight to watch.  Here he makes his Dr. Morbius a devilishly pompous and pendantic patriarch, and the histrionics with which he does so are perfectly suited to the character.  And finally, there's the lovely Anne Francis playing Dr. Morbius' daughter, Altaira.  While Ms. Francis does not have the same range or depth as Nielsen or Pidgeon, she takes a role that was meant to be eye-candy and makes it more than a mere cardboard cut-out.<p>So the storytelling, the FX, and the acting all combine to make FORBIDDEN PLANET a compelling film that entertains but also makes you think.  And to genre fans, that is science fiction at its best.<p>The MGM DVD is short on extras, basically offering only the theatrical trailer.  But the disc does offer the film in an anamorphic widescreen format at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and it appears that the digital transfer was made from a copy of the print that was in excellent shape for a film so old!  For SF fans who want to add this piece of classic American cinema to their collections, the reasonable amazon.com price makes it easy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>I have loved "Forbidden Planet" ever since seeing it as a kid years ago.  I was excited to see it in the Blu-ray format, and I wasn't disappointed.  The film looks spectacular, and the special effects -- state of the art at the time -- still look magnificent.<br /><br />Robby the Robot, of course, came away from this film a huge star, and it's fun to see him again.  You might be interested to know that the voice of Robby is actor Marvin Miller, who played the executive secretary of an eccentric wealthy man who, each week, gave away one million dollars tax-free on the TV show, "The Millionaire."<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen (playing it straight... this was well before his days as a comedy star in such films as "Airplane!) star.  Included in this release is the feature film, "The Invisible Boy," a follow-up film that capitalized on the popularity of Robby the Robot but had nothing to do with "Forbidden Planet."<br /><br />A sequel to "Forbidden Planet" was never made.  This big-budget epic, filmed in color, was MGM's first venture into the then emerging popularity of science fiction.  Most sci-fi pictures of the 1950's were black & white, low-budget efforts.  Only a few were made in color.  This and "War of the Worlds" are the most famous and best color sci-fi features of the Eisenhower era.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BSS2M2DPPV4T.html">A3BSS2M2DPPV4T</a><br/><p>Without giving away any details of the plot - for its best to watch for yourself - just know that this is a superb entry into the realm of Sci-fi flicks!

The eerie musical score, the atmosphere, even the odd Eastmancolor all add to the film's immense enjoyment. The film is essentially (and rather ingeniously) a futuristic variation/fantasia on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST: an undeniably brilliant excursion into outer space and the inner mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>I first saw `Forbidden Planet' when it was originally released in theaters in the late 1950's and at the time, it simply blew me away, and it was my hands down favorite hard core Science Fiction movie up to the release of `2001 A Space Odyssey'. And, even then, I begrudgingly pidgeonholed `2001' into its own special category to preserve the preeminant place of my beloved `Forbidden Planet'.<br /><br />The very first thing which sets `Forbidden Planet' off from so many other 1950's sci-fi movies is that it is clearly not simply a monster movie. Not that there are no good monster movies. Whitness `The Thing' and, of course, `King Kong', but `Forbidden Planet' was pure sci-fi, the kind which is driven by the defining characteristic of the genre. That is the proposition `What if this particular thing were true? What would follow from this (and be turned into the basis of the story)'. The fact that the story was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's `The Tempest' made absolutely no impression on me, as I didn't even realize this until long after the movie had passed into cult heaven. It was much  more impressive to me to realize that the whole idea of `Star Trek' was based on some of the `Forbidden Planet' premises.<br /><br />Watching this movie after almost 50 years of revering it's memory does a lot to enable a more balanced evaluation of the movie. The first thing is that while it remains one of the very best of its period and genre, it is not necessarily head and shoulders over other sci-fi movies of the same period. `The Day the Earth Stood Still' comes to mind as a critically successful movie of the time. But, aside from it's being in color, some differences between `Forbidden Planet' and `The Day...' stand out. The first is the quality of the special effects, done for M-G-M by a team from the Walt Disney studio. In the world of pre `2001' effects, `Forbidden Planet' probably outdid every other movie in special effects quality. They look ordinary by today's standards, but they were most definitely not as hokey as the run of the mill stuff in 1955. The flagship effect, of course, is Robbie the Robot who, to this day, I sneakily believe was a real machine and not a tin suit with someone inside. Even if Robbie was controlled by a human at a console at the end of a long cable, I was still impressed. Robbie set the standard for artificial intelligence on film until the Hal 9000 arrived on the scene. Another aspect of the movie which clearly set it apart from the rest of the pack is the distinctive nature of the sound track music. The credits clearly indicate that the music is synthesized and not performed on traditional string, wind, or percussion instruments. Like so many other things, this music defined sci-fi music for an entire generation.<br /><br />The very best thing about the movie was the sophistication of the `what if' premise. The story is that a scientific team of 20 people lands on the planet Altair 4 and 18 of the 20 are killed by a monstrous entity of pure energy created from the `id' of the team's philologist, Dr. Morbius, enhanced by the technology of the long dead natives of the planet, the Krell, who were killed by their unleashing these `monsters from the id' in their quest to attain a life of pure energy, separated from the body. Even the names `Morbius' and `Krell' have an enchantment about them which rings something in the soul of a teenager of the time.<br /><br />My memory of the plot of `The Tempest' is a bit rusty, but I can see the similarity in a nobleman, `Prospero' being stranded on a remote island with daughter, Miranda and their being found by a party in a passing ship. I also recall the character of Caliban, a `savage and deformed slave' according to my complete Shakespeare. The part of Caliban is played, with a major overhaul, by Robbie, of course. I can see no analogue to the facinating character of Ariel, `an airy spirit'. The adaptors of Will Shakespeare's idea should have made an effort to learn some dialogue from the bard as well as his story line.<br /><br />The most glaring blemish in the movie is some of the really dreadful use of words of which I am sure the script writers were proud as being examples of supplying new words for concepts of the future. Unfortunately, this dialogue grates rather than impresses. The other surface blemish is the sophmoric romantic action between the space ship Bellerophon's senior officers and daughter Altara. The behavior is so obvious and so contrived that I would have thought they could resist this easy business. But, they did not, and it does not one wit to move the story along. The rather amusing little encounter between the stereotyped ship's cook and Robbie makes a bigger contribution to the story than these romantic interests.<br /><br />These are merely surface defects which I have been able to overlook through several viewings over the course of my life. It has only been on this latest viewing that they stick out from the otherwise remarkable quality of the movie. The heart of the movie is the basic premise of the Krell, their fantastic power sources and machines built into the heart of the planet, their effort to free themselves from material form, and their distruction upon unleashing hidden powers from the very Freudian notion of the id, short for libido. As long as you are willing to buy into this premise, things go smoothly, but once you start thinking this through, the premise falls apart. But, this is sci-fi, after all, where time travel and faster than light travel are possible, so sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />A tarnished jewel of a movie, one of the very few `50s sci-fi works which deserve to be watched today.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"Forbidden planet" was probably one of the most boldest sci-fi projects whose only default was to have been extremely challenging for its age. The underneath message about a pretended form of outer energy understood as the projection of our own interiors demons lacked dramatic intensity due the secondary plot ( you should be notice this issue would be carved in relief in Solaris thirteen years after). But in case you make to take the risk you are still on time to enjoy (although certain outdated special effects) an interesting proposal to watch and discuss.<br /><br />A referential cult movie since its appearance!</p></br></body></html>

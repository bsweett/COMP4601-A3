No one would have the nerve to make a film as disgusting as this in the current "let's not offend anybody at all, ever" climate. Without a single frame of CGI, the Thing shoves our faces right into Rob Bottin's gruesome make-up effects and proves that genuine, tangible prosthetics and monsters are a million times scarier than a cheap, obvious effect done on a computer in post-production.<br /><br />I don't understand why people keep referring to this as a remake. It's far, far removed from Howard Hawks' version. Even Carpenter himself, a Hawks admirer, says that The Thing is it's own movie, and much closer to the original novella 'Who Goes There' by John W. Campbell Jnr.<br /><br />Set in the lonely Antarctic, The Thing takes the form of a wolf and bounds across the snowscapes to a US research station, pursued by frantic, half-mad Norwegians. Unable to communicate with the English-speaking American team they end up dead before being to warn them that the cuddly dog is actually a hideous shape-shifting monster. The team eventually discover the wreck of an alien spaceship that has been entombed in the ice for at least 100, 000 years before the monster begins to wreak havoc at the research station, intent on consuming all of the humans and making it to civilization where it can take over the entire planet.<br /><br />Fear and paranoia grow among the team as they desperately try to prove who is biologically human and who has been assimilated by The Thing. It's utterly horrific stuff, but it's not without its illogical moments and massive plot holes. The universal adoration of The Thing seems to forget that it doesn't make complete sense. Carpenter admits he lost track of who is and who isn't, which seems kinda lazy. Ambiguity can be a cheap way of maintaining uncertainty and Carpenter should have delivered a more focused and precise plot. Plus the paranoia was way overdone. By the halfway mark I reckon the fear among the men should have been merely implicit rather than verbally delivered at every opportunity.<br /><br />It's rather strange, and fitting, that this movie also comes across as a big-screen adaptation of HP Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness', which also features research scientists in Antarctica discovering an ancient shape-shifting lifeform and losing their sanity.<br /><br />Despite the problems, this is Carpenter's direction at its best, with long, slow, tracking cameras in gorgeous anamorphic Panavision, evocative lighting, and lonely minimalism. Even Ennio Morricone's score is very much restrained. The cast have their defining features mostly hidden beneath thick facial hair, but Kurt Russell once again proves why he is Carpenter's favorite lead, and the awesome Keith David provides plenty of badassness just with his mere presence.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is in lovely 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. Plenty of extras, and that weird U-Control 'thing' are also included.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>All the way back from the early 80's, John Carpenter's "The Thing" was the hottest Sci-Fi/horror film to be seen. I remember seeing a copy of Cinefex magazine, dealing with the production of the film. There was a ton of imagination and special effects that went into the making of "The Thing".<br /><br />What makes "The Thing" so creepy is the nature of the "Alien" menace. A creature that attacks and "takes over" it's intended victim at a cellular level, in essence becoming an exact copy of it's victim! What is perhaps it's most disgusting and surprising trait, is when it is either surprised or found out (identified). The laws of nature are thrown out the window, and you are witness to some of the most shocking mutations to ever come from a sick and depraved mind. To this, Carpenter puts into the mix a group of men who have undergone extensive psychological testing, just to be able to work in an isolated environment (no one wants these men going koo-koo a couple of months into their stay).<br />Well, let's just say that it wasn't enough. Once the menace is identified, little by little, these men come apart at the seams! It's every man for himself (itself?)!<br /><br />"The Thing" is LOOOOONG on suspense! At times, it's well, nigh unbearable. This is John Carpenter's best film. Rob Bottin's special effects deserved an Oscar. Kurt Russell was just coming out of his "sqeaky clean" teenage image that followed him from his early films.<br />There is one thing I find curious. On some copies of this film, a Stevie Wonder song is being played in the kitchen scene, and on others, it's different music. Also, there are copies with narration! Perhaps it was added when the film went to cable. This film, like Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho", are must-see (if not must-own) films for the horror fanster!</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>I usually don't see a film just for the special effects, but The Thing is an exception. If it's on TV, I almost always find myself watching it and waiting for the tour de force makeup by Rob Bottin (only 22 when The Thing started filming). Dogs morph into tentacled creatures, a man's chest turns into an alien creature's mouth and bites off another man's arms, a man's head splits in two and turns into a jaw with giant teeth that crush the head of another man and, in the most amazing scene of all, a man's head severs itself from it's body, sprouts spider legs and eyestalks and walks away. The effects are so good they're mesmerizing and hold up well 22 years after The Thing's release. To be sure, the film has other things going for it -- an imaginative screenplay and a great cast including Kurt Russell and veteran character actors Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Richard Masur and Donald Moffat, among others. But when the film is over, what sticks with you are the amazing effects. You just won't believe what you see onscreen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Antarctica 1982 12 researchers such as RJ Mcready (Kurt Russell), Dr. Blaire (Wilford Brimley), Childs (Keith David), Copper (Richard Dystart), Windows (Thomas Waites),  Nauls (TK Carter), Palmer (David Clennon), Clark (Richard Masur), Bennings (Peter Maloney),Norris (Charles Hallahan), Fuchs (Joe Pollis) and Garry (Donald Moffat) uncover an ancient spaceship buried in the ice for a million years. A parasitic shapeshifting creature gets thawed out and hides inside some members of the team as it mutates some of them including one of the dogs into hideous creatures for paranoia begans to start and who must try to find out who is the thing.<br /><br />Electrifying and shocking yet brilliant Sci-fi horror thriller from John Carpenter is one of the greatest films of both the Science Fiction and horror genres much like Alien and Aliens did. After the success of "Escape from New York" Carpenter began with writer Bill Lancaster to remake one of his favorite movies of all time known as "The Thing from Another World" that he grew up with as a kid, the original was very good but didn't have the time or technology in the 50's to do it justice and was a great movie on it's own but bad adaptation of the novel. So Carpenter decided to go back to the very original source that spawned the 1951 movie and make it more true to John Campbell's "Who Goes There" story as the creature is a shapeshifting parasite instead of a carrot-man. The film has brilliant performances by many including Wilford Brimley who is everyone's favorite Quaker Oats spokesperson only without his familar mustache, the film's special effects by Rob Bottin & Stan Winston are very realistic, gory, detailed and very amazing for it's time and still hold up even in this CGI era. The film unfortunately had bad timing as it came out 2 weeks after Universal's other alien movie "ET" which became the highest grossing movie of all time in that period and bombed at the box-office with some critical drubbing with a few postive reviews as some called this "a barf bag" or "Gore effects over characters" yet has became a cult favorite over the years thanks to video rentals, TV/cable showings, video/DVD/Blu-Ray/Laserdisc sales over many years and even merchandise of sorts recently. The film has gotten more reappraisal and tells us a realistic Sci-fi paranoia tale. This is a reimagining that improves on the original and does justice to what it intended to do, it was a labor of love for Carpenter and hats off to him.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers absolutely stunning picture and digital sound quality that feels very fresh for a 29 year old film and the only 2 extras are audio commentary and click feature length documentary of what you already seen on the DVD. If you own the original DVD then get this as an addition if your a fan of this masterpiece, i can't wait for the prequel coming this October.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Even though I was not a kid when I first saw this, it planted kernals of fear and revulsion in my imagination that has lasted until today.  A group of men - some scientists, some army grunts - are isolated in Antarctica, when their routine is disturbed by the sudden appearance of a helicopter that appears to be hunting a dog.  Though it explodes, this doesn't slow down one of the mysterious occupants, who are Norwegian, from shooting at the dog regardless of the danger it poses to the Americans standing aghast at the spectacle.  It is inexplicable, horrifically violent, and violates all the assumptions that men would normally make.  Several terrible mistakes are made:  the surviving Norwegian is shot by a security man without any explanation elicited, the dog is allowed the run of the compound, and the communications man fails to contact the outside authorities.  This casts the die for all that follows.<br /><br />OK, I am going to assume that anyone reading this knows the plot, so am not going to try to avoid the ***spoilers***.  The dog, it turns out, is an alien that the Norwegians discovered.  Its true nature is revealed when it is at last put in the kennel, where it transforms itself into a mass of greasy, flailing tubes and ripped flesh that spews liquid while seeking to ingest the other dogs.  The men quickly realize they are facing something unprecedented, a being that is like an infection that can consume any living creature and mimic it almost perfectly.  While it is vulnerable during transformation, this makes it a most formidable enemy.  Not only do the men not know who has become one of the creatures, but they suspect eachother to such an extent that all order and trust begin to break down.  The ensuing mayhem is unlike anything I have ever seen in cinema.  You wait for the characters - none of them particularly  likable or even interesting - to get picked off or murdered one by one.<br /><br />An additional danger is limned by a scientist who later appears to go insane.  He calculates that, should the creature reach a civilized area, the entire world will be infected in 27,000 hours.  But the purpose or goal of the creature, which first landed on earth at least 100,000 years ago and was frozen in suspended animation, remain opaque and hence food for the imagination of lovers of hard scifi.  This, I think, is the most frightening part of the film, indeed it is a completely original extrapolation from Bodysnatchers and other 50s scifi.  It heralds the end of humanity.  At the end, one of the characters admits that, because they have no idea of the limits of the infection, it is perhaps better if they die.  The perfect ending, with everything left hanging in the balance and yet no need for a sequel.<br /><br />The special effects, while primitive as modeled clay and rubber puppets rather than computer-generated images, are nonetheless compelling and utterly disgusting.  During transformation, the creatures appear to secrete a bloody liquid, though their interiors contain grotesque remnants of their past identities, from slimy dog or human heads to presumably alien lifeforms of singular ferocity.  There is a scene where the doctor is treating a heart attack victim, only to find the man's chest peels away to reveal giant jaws that bite off his hands; once incinerated by flamethrower, the creature's head seeks to survive on its own, pulling itself to safety by a prehensile tongue and then growing spider-like legs studded with eyes.  In another scene, a human-appearing creature captures a man, covering his mouth with a hand while tendrils corrupt his body with infection, which his eyes reveal he is helpless to stop.  These images are unforgettable.<br /><br />The acting is particularly strong, with Kurt Russel in his prime.  I completely believed what was happening, from their confusion to their paranoid frenzies.  That makes this a first-rate hard scifi thriller, full of action and unanswered questions.  Beyond the horror, the film filled me with wonder at the possibilities of the universe.  It is by far the best Carpenter film I have ever seen.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm for those who can stomach the horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>One of Carpenter's best, and coming on the heels of his B-masterpiece Escape from New York, The Thing is one of the better suspense/alien flicks out there (so to speak). The photography is excellent, the acting better than expected, the gooey monsters still pretty enjoyable, and one of its highlights is the typically superb Morricone score.<br /><br />So why would the studio nitwits give this one of the best blu-ray transfers out there...and dump all the extras from the dvd except the commentary? Plenty of gigs left on the disc...clearly they're going for the double dip yet again. These greedy weasels whine about piracy day in and day out and then pull their own piracy by putting out blu-rays with less features than the dvds that cost half as much! Insane.<br /><br />Unless you worship this film, which would justify buying this, I'd wait for the inevitable next version.<br /><br />Too bad, as this is a truly superb transfer. Borrow a friend's!<br /><br />PS The way Carpenter uses our sympathy for the dog at the start is real genius.</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>Back when Kurt Russell had more acting roles, it was good to see that he occupied his time by creating a partnership with John Carpenter. Never mind that this was a remake - it stands by itself for the reasons described above. The movie is perfectly paced and even though it has lighter moments, those don't last long.<br />It is an acting ensemble piece where there are no weak links in the casting.<br /><br />The audience remains as confused as the film's characters and all the elements of the plot take time in coming together. The beginning of the film doesn't make sense until the end - however, it is not a flashback.<br /><br />Some of the characters are on the verge of mental illness and the central event of the film just adds to the tension until something has to give, which it does in spectacular, violent and melancholy fashion.<br />In fact, one may feel deep sadness at the end of it.<br /><br />The film is a bit of a downer - there are only isolated action moments. In between is human desperation, as well as repeated failure in understanding and communicating, which the viewer shares. This film may well be both John's and Kurt's masterpiece.<br />Very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>"The Thing" stars Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley and is directed by John Carpenter. Right from the getgo, you know that this is going to be an awesome horror movie. And if that's what you guessed, well you are indeed correct! "The Thing" is a movie that's the epitome of paranoia and claustrophobia. The movie takes place among the barren landscapes of Antarctica, and focuses around twelve men secluded in a laboratory in the middle of the frost and snow. Then of course, comes the mysterious threat of the Thing!<br /><br />There are so many good points of this movie, it's hard to pick just a few highlights. "The Thing" is one of those movies where everything is done right. From the characters, who are all likeable, down-to-earth men that develop their different personalities over the course of the movie. Then of course the ever-intensifying atmosphere of the film, which grows and thickens with the growing threat of the mysterious Thing. The setting is also great, showing the terror of being isolated in an area with something dangerous in your midst. And probably most apparent is the absolute brilliance of the special effects! Nowadays, it's not common to find a movie with such great special effects, as a good deal of would-be great modern horror flicks are ruined by half-done CGI. Don't worry here, though, because "The Thing" is fully loaded with awesome special effects that'll have you loving the movie even more!<br /><br />Overall, "The Thing" is, as I previously mentioned, one of those movies where basically everything is simply done right. I certainly think that this movie would earn its spot among the highest-ranked horror films of all time, and is a movie that is still enjoyable no matter how much it ages, or how many times you watch it. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In Antartica, a group of researchers (Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Richard A. Dystrat, Charles Hallahan, Thomas Waites, Joel Polis, Richard Mauser, Donald Moffat, T.K. Carter and David Clennon) discovered an old spaceship that was buried in the snow for thousands of years. A parasitic shape-shifting creature has been thawed out as it hides inside a few of the team members for paranoia starts and those that might be The Thing.<br /><br />An electrifying and shocking brilliant remake of a 1951 Sci-fi/horror classic thanks to director John Carpenter of "Halloween" fame. The film has a talented all-guy cast including Kurt Russell as RJ McCready and lovable Quaker-Oats commercial fellow Wilford Brimley (Without his famed Mustache). The film was a box-office and critical bust upon it's release and was rediscovered later on DVD, Cable and VHS with now being reguarded as the ultimate remake. It's more true to the original story "Who Goes There" by Joseph Campbell then the 1951 movie and the special effects are still shocking yet amazing even in these days of CGI all done by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. The film is also about survival and paranoia as this is John Carpenter's second best movie besides "Halloween".<br /><br />This DVD offers a mind-blowing transfer of sound and picture in the highest quality possible even on Blu-Ray and the extras are terrific like audio commentary, an 80 minute documentary on this film, deleted Stop Motion scene from the film that was cut out, exclusive behind the scenes footage, outtakes, Trailer, behind-the-scenes location footage, storyboards and conceptual art, and annonated production achieve.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I've loved this film for many years, so I thought it's about time I got around to reviewing it. Along with John Carpernter's other masterpiece, Halloween, The Thing is not only my favorite horror movie of all time, but it is in my top 5 if you include all genres. I was first introduced to this film by my mom when I was a teenager. She has loved it ever since she saw it in theaters back in 1982, so now I share the passion. What makes this flick so great? When there are more great things to say about a movie than fingers on your hands, you know it's something special. I'll just quickly talk about a some of them.<br /><br />The atmosphere is number one in my book. Isolated at a remote research facility in Antarctica creates an amazing claustrophobic setting. Tension really builds when you have no where to go. The music is undeniably one of the creepiest and most suspense building stuff you will ever hear. Ennio Morricone of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly fame creates another masterful composition here. Other than Jaws, no other film's score has done more with two bass notes. Fear of the unknown plays a huge part, especially the first time you see it (I wish I could erase the film from memory and watch it for the first time again). Not being able to trust anyone but yourself becomes the motto. The special effects are way before the days of CGI and 27 years later they still look very impressive. The gore level is also quite high and disturbing. Some images will forever be burned in my mind. Maybe most importantly of all, this film is actually scary. I still get chills watching this alone at night with the lights off and I've seen it more than ten times. Just thinking about what might have went on at the destroyed Norwegian camp is enough to make the hairs on your arm stand up. There is not a weak link in the cast. Everyone is believable and you never for once think you are watching a bunch of actors. Even with someone as familiar as Kurt Russell, who wisely doesn't overplay the part. I also loved the ending. Sure it's a cliffhanger, but it still leaves that element of mystery that kept the movie going from the start. Pure class.<br /><br />So do you think I like John Carpenter's remake of The Thing? I was trying to think of some flaws, but a few minutes went by and I gave up. The bottom line is, this belongs in every DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Wow, when I first saw this movie on DVD, I was almost scared to death.<br /><br />The non-CGI effects are amazing, and are considered daring in its time (1982 was not really prepared for swell effects like these). The suspense and the paranoia get to me when I always watch this movie. Kurt Russel gives a great performance, and so do the other eleven.<br /><br />Watch this film (with the lights off). It's disturbing. It's mystical. And yes, it's a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>This movie is a real masterpiece. You can almost feel the tension between the scientist team as they are stuck in the middle of nowhere with an alien that can be anyone of them.<br />Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast make it all look very convincing and the movie simply does not let you go from the start. The special effects are still solid even today, which is amazing considering the year the movie was made.<br />(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>This movie is successful in every sense of the world, full of scares and pulse pounding thrills, it never lets up and to this day is one of Carpenter's best. Its just a shame that the critics in 1982 didn't feel the same way.<br /><br /> In 1982, a group of American scientists are in Antartica, set for a long winter full of poker games. One afternoon, a Norwegian helicopter flies into the area. A gunman is chasing a seemingly cute and innocent huskie through the snow, but both men in the helicopter soon die. The dog wanders into the American base, and proceeds to morph into the Thing one night while in the dog kennel. Don't want to spoil the fun however.<br /><br /> This movie has some great effects for the early 80's, and never lets up or lets the viewer down. The gore is used in appropriate spots, but is stomach churning. This movie has its violence, but it doesn't need the violence to scare the viewer. This movie never get's overly predictable, is never boring, has a huanting score, and keeps you guessing to the identity of the lifesucking Thing for the entire film.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>this movie is visually amazing and scares the hee bee jee bee's out of al who watch it, great acting, plot, and effects and must have for any horror or carpenter or movie fan for that matter.</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>This film is a complete gem and never sacrifices itself to mainstream vices. It has an all male cast, so is not ruined by an all too often pointless love interest inserted into the plot. It has mystry, horror, suspence, greta cting, great direction, plot and amazing special effects that are better than anything ive seen today. A great John Carpenter score to boot. This edition is packed with extras too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>I really envy people who have never seen John Carpenter's the Thing before and have no idea what's in store. Really if somehow you're reading this and haven't seen the Thing close out of this and just watch it right now. The Thing is a horror movie stripped down from all the BS cliches that most horror movies at the time and even now are bogged down by. People like to think Alien is the best sci-fi horror movie but you have no scenes in the Thing where there is some idiot chasing a cat down a dark hallway, none of that crap in the Thing.<br /><br />The start for the Thing is fairly slow, the film opens up in the empty Anartic tundra when a lone helicopter fades into view, chasing a dog while shooting at it. Not something you see everyday. The dog eventually runs into an American outpost where the Norweigens promptly follow, guns blazing on a hell bent mission to kill the dog. One of them accidently grazes one of the American's and promptly gets shot dead on the spot, leaving the American's with a destroyed helicopter and this dog. From here on out the American's do some investigating to see just what the hell happened and why, while the dog is free to roam around the camp.<br /><br />What The Thing establishes better than any film ever is a stifling sense of dread and paranoia, and when you actually see the Thing it is easily the greatest horror monster ever, Frankenstein, Dracula, Leatherface, Freddy, etc, eat your hearts out! It's such an ingenious design where you are shown a lot and yet you know very little about the Thing, it's origin, just how it got those ghastly shapes, etc, and like any good film it leaves the details up to your imagination. The other great aspect about it is that it can perfectly imitate anyone it kills, basically it's a much grislier version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and it can emote like us, sure there's a way to find out who's human but it takes quite some time to figure that out for the Americans.<br /><br />The pacing is perfect, at first everyone is mildly curious and confused at the Norweigen encounter early in the film, then when they discover just what the deformed corpse at the Norwegian camp is capabale of the scientists of the crew grow concerned (to say to the least for Blair), until finally everyone see's an incomplete Bennings contorting in the snow, then everyone is watching each other like a hawk and very skeptical of each other, tired and confused pointing fingers and making mistakes. This is where the sense of dread comes in, the whole atomosphere is so well established and maintained that this, more so than the monster, is what makes the Thing such an excellent horror film.<br /><br />The acting is perfect as well, unlike the Hollywoodized remake where Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the only person to basically make every decision, everyone in John Carpenter's weighs in on the situation and butt heads and form groups to oppose another's ideas. All of the actors are uniformly good, since there are so many of them none of them are really fleshed out but you get an idea of their different personalities, from the cold calculationg Blair to the wise-ass stoner Palmer, they all have a certain charm that distinguishes them from each other instead of just looking and acting like clones.<br /><br />The technical work is also phenominal, the sense of claustrophobia is well punctuated by the Anarctic blizzard that's going on for most of the movie, and it gives you a sense that you're stuck in a sardine can with a monster, the question is who? The establishing shots in the beginning showing the Anarctic are simply breathtaking, and the close up shots really emphasize each character's subtle reactions to the circumstances. The monster FX despite the final Thing looking like an obvious clay-model, the whole ambition and pay off is incredible, the Thing guarantees you'll see stuff you've never imagined before.<br /><br />Very, very few films in my opinion are five stars, but The Thing is goddamn perfect in every regard, the sheer ambition of it all and the fact that it all pays off well, The Thing is the crowning achievement of the 80's horror movies and set a high standard that horror movies (and movies in general) come nowhere close to. A must if you're a fan of horror, who-dun-it's, and air tight scripts, and don't mind disturbing graphic violence than you can't do any better than The Thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>John Carptenter's mastery of the horror genre needs no exposition from me - he's established himself a dozen times over.  His remake of 1951's "The Thing" may not rise to the legendary heights of "Halloween," but it remains one of the ten best horror flicks of the 1980s.<br /><br />Set in Antarctica in "Winter, 1982," the movie feels very modern thanks to the rumpled machismo of the cast - Kurt Russell and his band of roughnecks would be equally at home in any horror movie set today (with the limited mention of some dated '80s ethnic slang and boom-boxes).  Indeed, the only big miss with the movie is the idea that the movie was filmed during the Antarctic winter - anyone who has seen "March of the Penguins" knows that Antarctica can be a much more violent place than the sunny, bucolic vistas Carpenter often uses.  This is a minor quibble.<br /><br />The movie opens with a bizarre scene of Norwegians shooting at a racing Husky from a helicopter.  The Husky arrives at an American scientific outpost and fares much better than the Norwegians there.  All too soon we see that there is something incredibly different about this Husky and that the roughnecks realize it far too late.<br /><br />What ensues is a nasty bit of body-snatching that is the perfect bit of hell for a bunch of guys trapped at the bottom of the earth.  You're literally cut off from the world down there - what are you going to do when it's possible that the guy next to you is actually an alien replicant striving to infect the planet?<br /><br />Terrific special effects, strong performances, and creepy-as-all-get-out scenes fill this movie - a must-see for all fans of horror movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's "The Thing" wasn't so much a remake as a reinterpretation of John Campbell's classic short story. Closer in spirit to Campbell's conception of the Thing, Carpenter's film was both critically lauded because of the suspenseful storytelling and critically attacked for the excessive gore. While the gore is at times quite excessive it fits in with the audience expectations after films like "Dawn of the Dead" (the origianl 1979 movie)and other films of the era.<br /><br />What's amazing is how audiences are drawn into the story despite the fact that there are no characters we really, really like. We admire many of these men and their resolve but we don't like them. They're the product of their harsh environment and isolation. Mac (Kurt Rusell)is the helicopter pilot for an Antarctic science station. Their dull routine is interrupted by a team of seemingly crazy Norwegians pursuing a dog. The Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left without any idea as to what might have driven the Norwegians over the edge.<br /><br />Blair (Wilford Brimley)pours over the Norwegian journal brought back by Mac and Cooper (Richard Dysart)and discovers that the Norewegian team discovered an alien spacecraft with an occupant that was very much alive. More importantly, it can change into any shape and take over anybody.  Mac, Childs (Keith David) and the rest of the crew must destroy the alien before it can spread to the rest of the civilized world.<br /><br />Previously released as a "Special Edition" in 1998, "The Thing" has been remastered for this edition.The anamorphic widescreen presentation is, I believe, the first time this has been transferred in the anamorphic format. The previous widescreen edition looked exceptionally good and comparisons between the two transfers reveal minimal differences except for the fact that the new edition is presented in anamorphic (i.e. with a higher resolution) picture. There are some minor digital blemishes that occasionally crop up as on the previous edition (which makes me suspect the previous master was digitally remastered vs. creating a new master). The 5.1 Surround Sound mix has tremendous presence and is exceptionally good with crystal clear dialogue. Ennio Morricone's marvelous music sounds particularly rich and detailed. There's no isolated music track which is a pity.<br /><br /> The special features are exactly the same as the 1998 edition of the movie. "Terror Takes Shape" is an 80 minute documentary on the movie that includes both new interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from the shoot. Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the other members of the cast,the optical effects and make up crew and screenwriter Bill Lancaster on all phases from conception to post-production. It's an excellent and informative documentary divided into the various phases of production.<br /><br />We also see outtakes including the deleted  stop-motion animation that Phil Tibbert did for the movie. Carpenter cut almost all of it out in favor of the physical effects because they didn't quite mesh as well as they could have. There's substanial behind-the-scenes footage, photos and the work-in-progress visual effects for the film. Essentially, this indepth approach makes "The Thing" as close to a film school as you'll likely find on DVD.<br /><br />We also get the original theatrical trailer, storyboards and conception art. The "Visual Effects-in-Progress" featurette t gives you a clue as to how the visuals and effects changed during shooting. There's also an annotated production background archive with an essay on the production illustrated with excerpts from the screenplay with photos and production drawings. There's also a brief essay on the casting in text format along with production photos from the film.<br /><br />The commentary track is the original one from the 1998 release featuring John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. As with the "Escape from New York" commentary track, "The Thing" commentary track is exceptional with interesting and amusing stories related to the production of the movie as well as behind-the-scenes tidbits that fans will find valuable. Both clearly enjoy each other's company more twenty years after their first collaboration.<br /><br />The packaging has been redesigned. While it is pretty cool, it's not going to be really durable. The exterior plastic cover like that for "Stir of Echoes" looks really cool and wraps around the carbord and plastic inner case. The inner case has photos and images from the movie. The inside, curiously, looks like it was designed for a chapter sheet or booklet but there's nothing inside.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>Though The Thing shocked with its new level of gore when it came out in 1982, popular taste has pretty well caught up to the gore factor.  Now fans will be able to see it all in Blu-ray high-def.<br /><br />The Thing takes its title from the influential 1951 sci-fi classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NHC0">The Thing from Another World</a>, a film it otherwise resembles only in similarity of location and a few plot points.  (If you're interested in a less scary, more campy, funnier black-and-white version, with women in it, check out the older one.)  The location is an isolated antarctic research station, cut off from radio contact with the outside world, where Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David and several other men unknowingly take in an alien creature that can adopt the form of members of the crew as it destroys them.  They quickly find themselves in a desperate and paranoia-inducing situation, each not knowing who among the others might be an alien waiting to kill him.  Internal organs are spread into view in various creative ways, while violence and tension build.<br /><br />Director John Carpenter specializes in gritty, intense, violent suspense, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Though it didn't do very well when it came out, maybe because it was up against the much cheerier alien E.T., it has become a favorite since.<br /><br />The movie has already been released in HD at the same 1080p resolution the Blu-ray will have, so the transfer should be of similar quality.  The HD transfer is very good, with strong color and good detail and sharpness, definitely improved over the standard DVD.  The sound will be English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, with French DTS 5.1.  There will be English SDH, French, and Spanish subtitles.  *Update* 19 September: The early reviews verify that the transfer is high quality, as expected, with excellent picture and good sound (not much surround in a movie this old).<br /><br />*Update* Universal has said in its promotional material that this release will include the extra material from the current DVD, but according to the early reviews, that isn't true.  First, here are the special features announced in the main press release:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with star Kurt Russell and director John Carpenter<br />-- U Control Picture in Picture<br />-- U Control tutorial<br />-- BD-Live<br /><br />In addition, most of the 84-minute making-of documentary from the older DVD has been incorporated into the Picture in Picture (PIP) feature, meaning that you watch it in pieces in a window along with the movie.  The rest of the special features from the older DVD aren't included.  Just as a reminder of what those old features are, missing here:<br /><br />-- outtakes<br />-- deleted stop-motion animation<br />-- work-in-progress visual effects footage<br />-- behind-the-scenes location footage<br />-- behind-the-scenes photos<br />-- storyboard and conceptual art<br />-- annotated production archive<br />-- original theatrical trailer<br /><br />Again, those are old features that Universal has *not* included on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />I'm not into gore, but the suspense is well done here, and Kurt Russell is in his element.  Fine video transfer and good commentary make for a good package, but the missing features from the older DVD mean you may want to keep the old one too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>This movie had the terrible fortune of being released the same summer as "E.T -- The Extra Terrestrial." Audiences had their choice of going with Steven Spielberg's take on aliens -- adorable creatures that eat Reese's Pieces and befriend little boys -- or John Carpenter's version, in which the aliens eat people and befriend nobody. We all know which movie was the hit, and that is too damn bad, because "The Thing" is simply one of the ten best sci-fi horror movies ever made.<p>Forget labels, however. This film simply works. "E.T." twanged at your heartstrings: "The Thing" aims to rip them out alltogether, and it does a terrific job. Anyone who has read any of my reviews (I know there must be one of you out there somewhere....hi, Mom) knows that I'm a huge fan of "atmosphere" and this film cranks up some of the creepiest atmosphere around. Imagine this:<p>You and about ten other guys are snowbound on an Antarctic research station, several thousand miles from civilization, completely isolated. A shape-shifting alien that can imitate any form of life it comes into contact with -- dogs, people -- is unearthed from the ice after a 100,000 year sleep and wakes up in an awful mood. One by one, it picks off your buddies in unbelievably gruesome ways. Problem is, you aren't sure which of your buddies is human and which might be, well, "the Thing." Trapped in the remote station with no radios and no way of getting help, you are stuck fighting a monster that can not only imitate anything it wants, and perfectly, but which can form a whole new monster from any chunk of itself you happen to shoot, stab, or blow off. Now start to realize that if the thing wins, it will inflitrate the rescue team that will inevitably arrive, and from there, go on to wipe out the entire planet posthaste.<br />How do you tell who your friends are? How do you survive? Are you even sure you should? Ladies and Gentlemen, you've just gotten through about half an hour of "The Thing." And yes, matters get worse.<p>Carpenter is one of the biggest hit-and-miss directors around. When he misses, he usually misses big -- did you see "Prince of Darkness?" -- but when he hits, as he did on "Halloween" and yes, "The Thing" -- he sends that expletive-deleted ball flying right out of the park and bouncing into traffic. Everything about this movie -- the special effects, the dialogue, the acting -- especially by Kurt Russel, Wilford Brimley, and Keith David, but really the entire cast with no exceptions -- hits with magnum impact. If you're not creeped out, you're grossed out, and if you're not wondering who the hell the Thing is, you're finding out in a really unpleasant way. Rob Bottin did once-and-a-lifetime work on the SPFX and gore for this film, and while critics dissed it mercilessly for just that reason -- too much of the red stuff -- there is nothing in this film that happens for cheap shock value. Some have accused Carpenter of catering to those who slow down for car wrecks, but they miss the point -- what comes first in this film is the interplay between the characters. This movie is as much about paranoia as it is about blood, and if it exploits anything, it exploits just that -- our fear. Of the dark. Of the cold. Of ourselves and what might happen to us when the lights go out.<p>Isn't that what a horror movie is supposed to do?</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is an atmospheric, claustrophobic thriller that manages to be both a tribute to the original film by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby as well as a scary often surprising thriller on its own. Universal has ported over most of the extras from the original DVD for this set (although it is missing the deleted scenes as well as some of the visual effects outtakes)the only problem that exists with the presentation is that the extras are available to be viewed ONLY via U Control and, as a result, those with 1.0 Blu-ray players WILL NOT be able to access the pip extras. Those who have Playstation 3's or 1.1 players will be able to access these special features.<br /><br />"The Thing" looks extremely good in its Blu-ray debut with a sharper, clearer picture. Audio sounds extremely good as well.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the film the title creature infiltrates a remote science station in the Arctic. Cut off from the rest of the world when a blizzard hits, the crew of the science station discovers that the creature acts almost like a virus killing the original person and becoming a perfect replica of that person down to memories.<br /><br />Featuring strong performances from Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley and Donald Moffat "The Thing" is much more graphic than the film that Hawks made in the 50's but just as powerful and scary.<br /><br />My only complaint with the Blu-ray is that Universal didn't port over ALL the extras on the original DVD so fans will probably want to keep their DVDs as well. The U Control feature allows you to watch the original documentary in chunks related to sequences throughout the film. That's good but I do wish that Universal had designed this to shift all the music, effects and dialog into one set of surround speakers while the dialog and music from the documentary would come from the other with both given equal prominence.</p></br><a href="../users/AR14BIUHYR6B7.html">AR14BIUHYR6B7</a><br/><p>yes, this 1982 movie looks THAT good in HD.  The transfer done last year by Universal looks absolutely terrific...no complaints.  When you can see actual snowflakes against a snow-white background, you know that real care went into the video transfer.  And for a movie nearly 25 years old, the 5.1 sound still packs a punch, although the center channel lacks some of today's aural presence.  The standard special edition DVD looked great, but this one blows it out of the water!</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Not meaning to spoil the film for those that haven't seen it, the title of this review is a quote from one of the characters that brings a little humor in a very dark film.<br /><br />"John Carpenter's The Thing" is one of the great horror/sci-fi films of all time, featuring a brilliant cast of veteran performers, led by he-man Kurt Russell.  While Russell's name appears alone in the opening credits, each of the remaining cast members gets sufficient screen time in the claustrophobic tale that combines paranoia, alien invasion, the perils of being secluded, and hopelessness.<br /><br />Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Masur, David Clennon, Charles Hallahan, Joel Polis, T.K. Carter, Richard Dysart, Thomas G. Waites, and Peter Maloney round out the-ten-little-Indians' cast.  Fans of the Agatha Christie novel will understand the comparison.<br /><br />State-of-the-then special effects, a great Ennio Morricone score, an engaging script and great direction from Carpenter make this the most memorable of the three tellings of the original short story.<br /><br />This DVD features both a fascinating 83-minute "making of" documentary and an informative commentary-with-Carpenter-and-Russell version.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Not all of the bonus content from the DVD was carried over to the Blu-ray, and no one is really sure why.  But a large chunk of the behind-the-scenes documentary is included in the U-Control feature, as well as a few moments here and there that were not included on the DVD.  The commentary track is the same.<br /><br />The experience you get from the U-Control footage (done as picture-in-picture) is largely the same as the experience you get watching the DVD bonus content.  Not exactly the same, but close enough.<br /><br />Excellent picture and sound quality on this Blu-ray and the price is certainly right.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>One of my favorite sci-fi, and horror films has always been Ridley Scott's 1979 classic Alien, and for a while now I've been looking for a film that would make for a good late-night double feature (excluding the sequel, Aliens).  Of course, when I searched I mostly found rip-offs that couldn't hold a candle to the levels intrigue, and suspense set by Scott's film; in fact, most of them were simple rip-offs of Alien.<br /><br />I finally found this version of The Thing after having liked the original 1952 version for over a year.  I'd always been hesitant to try Carpenter's remake, because I am always hesitant when confronted with remakes; especially ones of beloved classics, such as The Thing from Another World.  When I finally watched this remake I was pleased to discover that Carpenter did a remake right!  This film features plenty of homage, honoring the legacy of the original film, while also recreating the plot almost 100%, except for the setting, and some character names.  The opening title is the same way it was done in the 1951 film, and any fan of the original will be sure to notice the similarities (I believe Carpenter's Thing makes a very similar sound to the original's; just edited a bit to make it more menacing for a modern audience).<br /><br />Everyone should know the basic premise of The Thing movies (based on the sci-fi classic short story `Who Goes There?') where scientists in a remote Arctic base find themselves under siege from an alien invader, who's been frozen in the ice for thousands of years.  As members are picked off one-by one individual's personalities begin to clash, leading to internal conflict.<br /><br />To keep his film fresh and original Carpenter returns to the short story, making his alien capable of shape shifting: this increases the tension between the members of the cast.  Most of the movie they have no way of discovering who is, or not one of them, and they are never capable of fully trusting one another.  The stand out is of course the way Carpenter depicts this creature's abilities to change, causing some of the most disturbing images you will ever see in the movies.  Between the puppets, and stop-animation this is some of the best shot monster effects of the 1980s (not to mention nauseating).<br /><br />The film is lead by one of my favorite action stars Kurt Russell, who has teamed up with John Carpenter on several occasions (most notably Escape from New York).  Russell's character is essentially a clich&eacute; drunken-slob-turned-hero, but Russell does do a good job with it, and makes you root for his character, even when evidences points towards him not being human.<br /><br />Most of the characters in the scriptare cardboard, made up of stereotypes, and clich&eacute;s, but Carpenter still manages to get the audience to care for the central characters, even though you only learn very little regarding these characters past, or present lives.  He creates a wonderful sense of paranoia as the characters try to locate the imposter among them, and the audience is pulled into this conflict by the evidence provided by the crafty Carpenter, either by visual signs, or subtle dialogue.<br /><br />I wouldn't call The Thing one of the best movies of all time, but I can say it is one of the most well crafted horror films of the last thirty years.  The visuals are as disturbing as they are frightening, and the direction is perfect, and this is all topped by a subtle, yet disturbing Carpenter-inspired score by Ennio Moriccone.  This movie will shock and disturb audiences of all ages, and at the same time provides terrific entertainment for moviegoers, and horror buffs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Largely ignored at the time of release, Carpenter's "The Thing" has grown in stature in years to become a cult classic. With his compatriot, Kurt Russell and a great cast (Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley, David Clennon, Keith David in one of his first film roles, Donald Moffat, Richard Masur, etc), Carpenter fashioned a film that is closer to the original story, "Who Goes there?". This was one of my first HD's that I purchased, and it is definitely a test on the audio/visual aspects of your system. Along with the original "Halloween" and "Assault on Precinct 13" this should have put Carpenter in league with Spielberg and Lucas but unfortunately his work has been mediocre in recent years.  Definitely a must see for horror/sci-fi fans and Carpenter buffs!!</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>With each and every remake that Hollywood churns out, especially in the horror genre, there is always the hope that it will turn out at least half as well as John Carpenter's brilliant remake of "The Thing From Another World," simply retitled "The Thing." Much like David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of "The Fly," "The Thing" has earned cult status by being one of the few remakes in the history of film to not only improve upon the original, but make the general public forget it existed. It's that good! With top-notch special effects for it's time (1982!) and an isolated, ice-cold setting full of unsavory and suspicious characters, Carpenter crafted one of the creepiest and most original horror movies of the eighties and delivered some images that the viewer will likely never forget.<br /><br />Starring Kurt Russell, Wilford "Check Your Blood Sugar Often" Brimley, Keith David, and an oversized cowboy hat, "The Thing" revolves around a group of scientists hunkered down in Antarctica. Completely isolated and going stir-crazy within a matter of days, the group learns a new definition of cabin fever when an alien lifeform takes over the crew one by one. Unlike the alien in, say, "Alien," this one actually imitates whatever lifeform it infests, making it nearly impossible to tell who's who. As the men turn on each other, and as Russell's beard grows in thicker, you can literally feel the walls closing in and the mood turning darker and colder. Like all the good Carpenter flicks, this one is a slow-burner that gets you close to the characters before dispatching of them. And the way some of these folks are dispatched of can be downright gruesome! The special effects are marvelous and actually hold up today. It's enough to make even today's desensitized audience a bit squeamish. But even without the gore, Carpenter still has his suspense mastered. This is one horror film that is impossible to look or walk away from, because as the events unfold, everything gets more twisted and more shocking.<br /><br />Audiences in 1982 may of passed it by, but it has since then earned it's place in the Horror Hall Of Fame. Not only is it one of the best remakes ever, but it's also one of John Carpenter's finest films, and a brilliant bend on the alien invasion genre. Horror and sci-fi geeks will love it, and if you haven't experienced it yet, you're really missing out on a gem.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>The title phrase uttered by Dr. Copper (Richard Dysart) says it all about John Carpenter's "The Thing".  When Copper and MacCready (Kurt Russell) arrive to investigate a Norwegian research station after a bizarre, violent incident at their own base, they find some horrific events have taken place.  Upon their return, they discover an alien from space has invaded their American Antarctic Research station, and no one is sure just who is who.<br /><br />"The Thing" was adapted from "Who Goes There?", a classic SF short story by John W. Campbell, and adheres fairly closely to the original.  A fine ensemble cast of actors such as Keith David (Childs)and Richard Masur (Clark) populate the isolated station.  Several of these actors went on to success in show business; for example, David is now narrating "The War", Ken Burns' documentary on America's participation in WWII (now being broadcast on PBS).  With director John Carpenter, the actors do a fine job of projecting the suspicion and fear the monster in their midst has created.<br /><br />A real star of "The Thing" is special effects maestro Rob Bottin, who was only in his 20s when the film was made.  Bottin was given complete creative freedom in designing the horrific appearance of the chameleon-like alien. The beast has a completely different look each time it shows itself, combining the various lifeforms it has absorbed along the way.  The creature is not neat by any means-each appearance is accompanied by buckets of blood and gore.<br /><br />"The Thing" impacted me greatly when I first saw it 25 years ago.  When the sled dog's head split open like a banana being peeled I knew I was in for something different... I had never seen anything quite like it before, and frankly still haven't.  I have this film in my DVD collection, and still watch it regularly...</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>"The Thing" is one of the best remakes I have ever seen!

It never gets boring and just keeps you focused. When the head turns into a spider is just an aweseom part funny and bugged out but very well done, the way it sprouts legs is just cool as hell. With  out a doubt this is one of the  top 5 or 6 horrors ever made, IMO atleast. $14.99 is great , but if it was $21.00 or $24.00 it is still worth it, a movie that you will be able to always watch.

Now with this crazed creature, trust is a broken issue among the scientists, as each one fights for himself to the bitter end. <p>While not the scariest horror movie by any means, this film more than has the ability to scare you on its own merits. Be warned: once you have watched THE THING, you may never look at movies like this the same way again.

The alien creature and all the gory happenings surrounding its presence are so firmly imprinted in my mind that it's kind of like recalling a &quot;nice&quot; trauma.  The cast is superb, the direction spectacular.  This is the movie that should have put John Carpenter on the map, not Halloween.  It's much more intense than any mask wielding madman.  The idea of an unstoppable enemy, an enemy that one cannot identify until it is much too late is such a bone-chilling concept and it is pulled off with a magician's flair.  So if you have a fear of the dark, of death in a horrible fashion, or of never being able to trust anyone, well here's the movie for you.

Although the story is nothing new and pretty much the same as the original, the film carries punch with good acting and special effects.<br /><br />  The story is essentially the same as the original. A military expedition is sent to investigate the crash site of a mysterious alien craft in the Arctic. An alien body is found frozen and taken back to the camp. As the alien body thaws, things start going horribly wrong. Kurt Russel is the main character who has to confront the full horror of the mysterious alien.<br /><br />  What makes this film worthwhile is the suspense of not knowing how or when the alien creature will strike next.  Also worthwhile are the great special effects which, of course, couldn't have been possible in 1951.  Both elements bring to life one of the more decent plots to come out of the 1950s Sunday matinee pulp horror/sci-fi films such as 'The Blob' and other 'B' movies. The cinematography is good and the acting decent. A film worth watching more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>An alien theme plays as a helicopter flies across the South Pole landscape.  Below it is a wolf dog, running through the snow.  Apparently, the helicopter is chasing the dog.  The pilot emerges with a gun and begins firing at the creature as it runs towards a base of American scientists.<p>Soon, this doesn't sound as strange as it seems.  Kurt Russell stars as the American scientist who learns the secret of the creature: it's over 100,000 years old, frozen beneath the ice, and pissed off.  We also learn that if it reaches civilization, within 27,000 hours the entire planet would be taken over by this creature - an alien lifeform that can imitate whatever it kills.  Dogs, spiders, grandma - this thing can do it.  It's up to old 'Russ to save the day and destroy everything in sight in a blind rage.<p>When first released in 1982, &quot;The Thing&quot; met with mixed critical reaction - most of it bad.  It was either &quot;not scary&quot; or &quot;relies on special effects&quot;, but rarely would you find a positive review.  Now, in the new millenium, the film is finally getting the recognition it deserves.  &quot;The Thing&quot; has quite deservedly joined the ranks of the most famous horror films of all-time.  It is even arguably more popular than it's basis, the 1951 sci-fi classic &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;.<p>First we'll cover the more commonly debated aspects of the film.  One is the acting.  I felt the acting was excellent, especially Russell as the determined chosen leader of the team.  Donald Moffat is the only other actor in the crew that is somewhat popular, but that has no affect whatsoever on the cast.<p>The on-screen title of the film is &quot;John Carpenter's The Thing&quot;, and Carpenter is probably the movie's second-most-important aspect.  His direction is eerie and suspenseful - this movie helped elevate him to his current position as a thriller genius.  If you truly look at this film, you can tell Carpenter wasn't trying to make it scary - he wanted to make it suspenseful, although there are a few jumpy moments in this film.<p>There's also a fitting and chilling score by Ennio Morricone.  It definitely doesn't rank amongst the master composer's greatest scores, but it works well on the mood of the film.<p>The most important, and no doubt the greatest, aspect of the film is Rob Bottin's special effects.  They are extraodinary.  Every scene involving the alien parasite is completely convincing.  Whether it's a gruesome alien bursting from a dog's body, or a severed head sprouting spider-like legs and walking around the room, the effects are outstanding.  Bottin proves himself to be a make-up genius.<p>It's no wonder &quot;The Thing&quot; is a classic.  Its documentary-like feel and creepy atmosphere are perfect.  Carpenter has succeeded in making a thrilling wonder that may even surpass it's aforementioned story source.  No horror, sci-fi or thriller fan should go without at least taking a look at this chiller masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Drop that latte, get that lemon biscotti out of your mouth, drag your behind down to your local dvd retailer and buy The Thing.

Carpenter's infamous gore-fest is a finely crafted thriller featuring some of the most bizarre make-up effects ever captured on celluloid.<br /><br />Situated in a remote arctic research facility, the film follows Kurt Russel and his colleagues as they battle against an extraterrestrial horror they inadvertently unearthed from a glacier.<br /><br />This 'thing', whatever it is, can take any shape it wants, leading to frequently bloody creature transformations. As the movie progresses the creatures get weirder and more grotesque, an impressive feat considering that it was accomplished without any computer special effects.<br /><br />The relative lack of cheesy dialogue and complete absence of female nudity (or females altogether) are notable departures from the standard format of the genre. This gives the film more time to explore the evolution of suspicion and paranoia between the researchers, as well as the desperate acts of self-preservation that ultimately result.<br /><br />An excellent film with very few weak moments. A worthy 'collectors' edition with tons of extras including an 80 minute making of movie, commentary, deleted scenes and more! Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>This movie came out when I was born, and I saw it few years later, and watching it recently I have enjoyed it for the second time, even more so! The speical effects are amazing! This movie can stand the test of time, because not once during the movie have I thought that anything looked fake, plastic or not believable.<br /><br />Kurt Russel and the crew are great, stranded on a work site in Antarctica, when the weather become cold, they have no outside contact and they discover an alien space skih and an intruder hiding in one of the men.<br /><br />The special features;, making of the movie, was fantastic! Over an hour long, it gave you true insight on how the movie was made. I would have bought the DVD alone just for that.<br /><br />This is great, scarry and keeps you in tip top suspence.

That being said, I equally appreciate John Carpenters remake of The Thing. Carpenter has since lost his touch, but we can all dig into the past and see his brilliance especially in this film. With Special effects galore, free from CGI gremlins, and a perfect cast, free from feminine distraction, we get an honest to goodness monster/alien movie that still resonates to this day as creepy, disgusting at times, and brilliant. It's great to see Wilford Brimley sans mustache and not beating "diabetes" into our brains, and Kurt Russell with his piercing eyes and sweet beard giving one of the best performances of their careers in my opinion. The plot is straightforward, fast moving, and it doesn't presume its audience is a bunch of dummies. We have no romance, no women at the outpost, we don't have any long stupid speeches about humanity, we don't have some alien spouting domination plans, and we don't have the same old "hunter and hunted" script that most horror movies fall into. It's all over the place, paranoia, conspiracy, anger, suspicion, and horror. The special effects are bloody, visceral, oozing, your eyes deceive you then you want to cringe. These are the creatures that make you afraid of the dark, that whisper into your ear to never go into the dark alone, and the thought of becoming one of them is unfathomable. The sounds, the sights, the "man-fest" is worth watching over and over again, especially if you were like me and watched through your fingers.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I saw this movie after seeing the 2011 prequel. John Carpenter did a great job at directing this movie. It has a claustrophobic atmosphere, creepy music, and most importantly the special effects. I absolutely love the gore and creature effects in this movie, they are amazing if you're a gore-hound like me. Picking up exactly where the 2011 prequel left off, the Norwegians are chasing a dog because it's 'the thing' The dog makes it to the American research team and begins to infect and become them. MacReady, played by Kurt Russell becomes the leader and tries to figure out which of his team has become 'the thing' If you love horror, sci-fi, gore, and Carpenter's work, you'll love THE THING!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Unfortunately completely overshadowed by it's far lighter, and good-natured counterpart "E.T.:Extraterrestrial" which came out two weeks earlier, John Carpenter's "The Thing" couldn't have been more removed from E.T.<br /><br /> Set in Antarctica during the onset of the southern hemisphere's winter, a team of scientists stumble upon a group of Norwegian men who are shooting at a dog near their base. With the attempt thwarted, the scientists discover a ghastly enemy in their midst. It is an alien lifeform that copies the physical nature of the host it assimilates, albeit in a graphic and messy fashion. The alien's true form is never seen due to it's nature to hide in it's host, and mimic the thought and memory patterns as well.<br /><br /> Now they must be able to prevent this lifeform from escaping into the rest of the world but at the same time, it's ferocious nature makes it impossible to know if it's host is infected or not.<br /><br /> "The Thing" is among the scariest and most graphically bloody movies that I've ever seen but it's plot is marvelously written. A shame it was overshadowed by it's much more  successful counterpart "E.T.".</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This is a classic movie that really looks great on blu ray.  The only problem is that Universal decided not put deleted scenes and other extras on it. There is no excuse for not putting the same extras that a special edition has on a blu ray because the price is the same.  SO the movie gets five stars, the transfer looks great but you just don't get any extras.  At this price you should get all of the extras that a special edition has.  This flick though remains one of the best sci fi movies ever made and it's just too bad that they decided to remove any decent extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This intense sci-fi film is almost horror in nature, a la "Alien" as it features a tremendous amount of suspense. In fact, if you liked "Alien," you'll probably like this, the main difference of the two films being the different setting and a different cast.<br /><br />The cast may be different but the characters are the same: scientists-heroes who are all profane low-life-types who you would never see in professions and positions like this. Only in the world of film do you see sleazy people like this in high-tech intelligent positions such as astronauts or scientists. Who better to exemplify this in the 1980s than self-proclaimed macho man Kurt Russell?<br /><br />Back to the positives: besides the great suspense, the story is an involving one that hooks you in fairly early and never lets go. I have a widescreen VHS copy which looks nice, too, since the visuals definitely warranted a widescreen viewing experience. I suspect a Blu-Ray verson of this would really look great.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's classic science fiction/horror film receives a terrific upgrade for HD-DVD. I must admit I was reluctant to pick this up only because I had picked up a couple of HD-DVD discs of late that didn't quite live up to the hype (due to faulty or weak transfers not to the technology). Universal has basically slapped the high definition transfer from the previous edition with the bonus features and remastered them for the new format. Is it a huge improvement over the DVD edition? No but it does look better than the previous edition of the film on DVD (the high definition anamorphic transfer).<br /><br />For those that need to know the plot summary I've included it at the end. A remote American Arctic station comes across a group of Norweign scientists trying to kill a sled dog by shooting it from their helicopter. When they show up at the American station one is accidently killed while the other is shot by the station commander (Donald Moffit). The group of scientists/helicopter pilots take the dog in but quickly discover its some sort of alien metamorph that can become a perfect replica of anything it touches. It operates much like an infectious disease. Mac (Kurt Russell)galvanizes the others to try and destroy the thing as it gradually begins picking off the crew now cut off from possible escape because of a vicious storm.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>One of the most creative and disgusting horror films of our time, John Carpenter's `The Thing' has held its own ground through more than two decades, still producing the loud cry of "Euewwwwwwww" from both new viewers and old.  Never has there been a slimier, stealthier, more appalling evil that what comes out of the snow in this spectacular film.<br /><br />The film opens at an American camp in Antarctica, when the men's routine day is interrupted by a crazy Norwegian flying into their camp by helicopter and shooting at a Husky.  "Why is he shooting at that sweet doggie?"<br /><br />After taking out the insane Norwegian, doggie is put in with the other dogs at the American camp.  But is doggie really a doggie?  The Americans fly over to the Norwegian camp to attempt to discover what happened to the insane man.  They find a camp filled with dead men, a burned pile of fleshy debris, and a huge spaceship in the ice.  Naturally, they take the fleshy thing back to study it, and find that it is a mixture of unformed species, including human.<br /><br />In the meantime, doggie is ready to take over more than just a Husky body.  Doggie is a `Thing', an organism whose every cell is alive and coded for survival.  Only one cell from this organism can invade and take over a host, mimicking its looks, thoughts, patterns, everything.  But above all else, it must survive; it must defend itself.<br /><br />What follows is a full-blown terror fest of horrendously tense proportions.  Stuck in a camp on the ice, with The Thing in their midst, the men no longer know who they can trust, and who is still human.<br /><br />I remember seeing this film in the theater, on the big screen, in 1982 when it was first released.  This was the only movie I ever saw that I found myself unable to finish my popcorn while watching it.  The special effects, even in today's standards, are breathtakingly grotesque and morbidly twisted.  The fear and foreboding in the atmosphere of the movie is palpable, and the scream bubbling up in your throat is very real indeed.<br /><br />Excellent performances by Kurt Russell (MacReady), Wilford Brimley (Dr. Blair), Keith David (Childs), David Clennon (Palmer), Charles Hallahan (Norris), T.K. Carter (Nauls), Richard A. Dysart (Cooper), Peter Maloney (Bennings), Richard Masur (Clark), Joel Polis (Fuchs), Donald Moffat (Garry) and Thomas g. Waites (Windows).  Special note, the computer voice in `The Thing' was done by Adrienne Barbeau, queen of the B terror flicks.  Each and every one of these actors did a superb job in the film.<br /><br />This is a movie you simply have to watch for the grossness and the impending doom, which will deliver a question at the end that will leave you awake far into the night, pondering as you gaze over at your snoring mate.  Truly, one of my absolute favorites, and one of the best horror movies of all time.  A ten star film!  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Thanks in part to the frenetic efforts of John Carpenter, the horror film medium flourished anew in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Few fans of the genre need a reminder that Carpenter directed the classic "Halloween," an independent film that went on to great success and eternal status as a cult classic. While the tale about the merciless Michael Myers certainly didn't invent the slasher film (look back to Mario Bava's classic "Twitch of the Death Nerve" to see an earlier effort), it influenced many others to carry the torch in the following years. Carpenter's recent films just don't compare with his early fright fests. That's a darn shame, but for horror aficionados, watching the troika of "Halloween," "The Fog," and "The Thing" will always deeply satisfy. My experiences with Carpenter's remake of "The Thing" centers on an amusing if slightly embarrassing story. When the film first came out back in the early 1980s, I was way too young to see it in the theaters. A friend of mine who did manage to witness the carnage returned with stories of horrors bleak enough to chill the blood. For some reason, the fear I felt from his whispered words stayed with me for years to come until I finally sat down to watch this masterpiece in my teens. Pathetic, huh?<br /><br />"The Thing" isn't as scary (although it does have a few nice shocks) as it is extremely gory. Imagine a crew of arctic researchers trapped in a base on Antarctica uncovering a gruesome, potentially apocalypse inducing alien being with the ability to assume the shape of any earthly life form. There's the basic summary of the movie. In Carpenter's remake, the cast of characters consists of a plethora of familiar actors instantly recognizable to both B-movie and general audiences. You've got Kurt Russell heading up the bill as the aloof MacReady, the base's helicopter pilot and the man to come to when everything falls apart. Wilford Brimley turns up as Blair, one of the base's doctors and the first man to recognize the earth shattering potential of The Thing. You've also got T.K. Carter as Nauls, David Clennon as Palmer, Keith David as Childs, Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, Richard Masur as the dog keeper Clark, Donald Moffat as Garry, Charles Hallahan as Vance Norris, and Peter Maloney as George Bennings. I imagine many of these names don't mean much printed on a piece of paper, but once you watch the movie you'll see the cast forms a veritable who's who of main and supporting characters from dozens of memorable movies. The cast alone is a big reason "The Thing" succeeds wildly.<br /><br />The movie unfolds at a breakneck pace. Things start to go bad when a helicopter from the Norwegian base chases a dog into the American compound. Spraying bullets after the hapless pooch, the helicopter blows up when a carelessly dropped grenade explodes. Mystified by this weird behavior, the Americans stash the dog in the kennel and launch an expedition to the Norwegian base. They find everything destroyed, but they also find some film showing a weird discovery. Apparently, these poor chaps found a massive flying saucer in a crater, and what's more they found something nearby frozen in the ice. Sure enough, when they brought this thing back to the base, it defrosted and subsequently decimated its discoverers. By the time MacReady and his fellows discover that the dog carries the alien creature, and that it shape shifts easily, the game is afoot. Paranoia and panic rapidly set in as no one in the group can be absolutely sure that the beast hasn't taken over the other guys. At least they figure out that the alien despises fire, but by then it's far too late to do much. Most of the crew perished in the struggle to stay alive and uncontaminated. The movie boasts one of the best conclusions in horror film history.<br /><br />There is so much to like about Carpenter's film that it's hard to pin down one specific element of success. As a huge gore fan, I probably ought to focus attention on the gruesome special effects. Constructed by effects guru Rob Bottin, the prosthetics and other amazing wizardry on display here stuns the eye and boggles the mind. You've got dogs turning into masses of writhing tentacles, chest cavities turning into giant teeth, heads morphing into spider-like creatures, and other ghastly, gluey nightmares. And it's all done without CGI! But the gore isn't the whole movie--not by a long shot. You also get an increasing sense of pervasive doom as the research team struggles to survive. Think about it; you're stuck in an inhospitable environment with no way out while an alien creature methodically chases you down. I think I'd go insane, and some of the crewmembers do exactly that, but others step up to the challenge. "The Thing" is definitely one of those films that forces you to examine your own thoughts in an effort to discover which camp you would fall into if faced by similar circumstances.<br /><br />The extras on the Collector's Edition disc are extensive and massively entertaining, perhaps the best extras I've ever seen on a DVD. You get a commentary track with Kurt Russell and John Carpenter, a lengthy documentary about the film with cast and crewmembers, trailers, outtakes, storyboards, stills, and text documents about the conception of the film. I sat enraptured by these extras, although the text stuff tends to repeat things you'll hear in the documentary. The best thing about the extras is listening to Rob Bottin tell stories about the troubles he had pulling off the special effects work. He comes across as one of those guys who can make any story hilarious because of their vocal inflections and mannerisms. This DVD is one of the best out there; I hope they put it back on the market soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Fans of John W. Campbell's short story, "Who Goes There?", which both this movie and the first cinematic version, "The Thing From Another World" were based on, will recognize this incarnation as much more faithful. The 1950s version, most notable for James Arness (of "Gunsmoke") as the monster, isn't as good as this classy, gory, spine-chilling horror romp. The cinematography is so good I shivered through the movie, cold as well as scared. Not "dated" even though the movie was released almost a quarter century ago. ENJOY!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Despite being excessively popular, I don't have much memories of watching a John Carpenter movie from start to finish, either because I've never watched it (Assault on Precinct 13) or because they were so bad, they quickly left my mind (Escape from L.A., Vampires). But since the Thing is an often-mentioned recommendation when trying to watch a good Carpenter movie, I thought I'd check it out. While it's not necessarily an amazing horror movie, it's a bit effective if a bit familiar and a bit gruesome for gruesome's sake.<br /><br />The film starts off in the Antartic wilderness with a group of men in a helicopter trying to shoot at a running dog. A group of American scientists manage to take down the men and rescue the dog but turns out the dog was not who it appears to be and when investigating the other team's camp reveals a ship in the ice and a body shape in another block of ice which can imitate any form it wants, the team has to figure out who's really who and try and stop the "thing" before it wipes out the whole crew or makes back to the mainland.<br /><br />It's not the most familiar story of course although many films and even TV episodes such as the X-Files "Ice" are described very much as being similar to this film. What makes this film stand out is that there's a real sense of paranoia among the team and people overreacting and wondering who could be not who they are was well played. But then again, the characters don't really have much to do and besides certain actors, I couldn't even remember the character's names or distinguish faces. The film often has things that are unexplained or things that are merely implied so it's sort of a film that you kind of have to be serious in watching yet turn off your brain in sections.<br /><br />Like a lot of horror, you can either go for creepy atmosphere and tension to scare your audience or just think about totally disgusting stuff and call it a day. To that end, the Thing is sort of a combination of the 2 with the latter winning out by a nudge. This is a film with some pretty vile imagery and I'd recommend you don't eat before this one. There are times when it gets memorable such as a dog or something to do with defribillators and a petrie dish but at times they look dated so guess it depends on whether you can blow past it and watch anyway.<br /><br />The highlight of the special features is definately the commentary with Carpenter and star Kurt Russell as its funny and informative, then there's also a documentary covering the film although I never bothered with the production photos as there's looooots of them. But if you're into Carpenter's movies or a fan of horror, check the film out.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>they sure didn't give this movie the credit it deserved. i'm telling you john carpenter did it again. man, this movie was extra good. the actors did a phenomenal job, the whole idea was brilliant, and the setting...what better place. who's who. the aliens really do exist among us, but as humans. this one was just plain evil. for it's time the effects were great, personally one of the best. total isolation, the thing, paranoia sets in, distrust, and nowhere to go. all you have is to fight back, whether you're the last man standing. the ending was good, he leaves it all up to you. if they don't kill each other the weather surely will. i do recommend this mind blowing classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I saw this at the Cinema in 1982 and on occasions had to watch through my fingers!<br /><br />This film and Aliens were the last two great Sci-fi/horror films that did not have digital special effects. The effects in this film are astounding. For the younger people reading this (those born after the late 60's) you have to realise that what you see on the screen was actually created in the studio and not on a computer. They still look good compared with todays CGI and remain the pinnacle of animatronic special effects. Full credit to Rob Bottin the special effects wizard on The Thing.<br /><br />The film itself is a claustraphobic affair once The Thing is loose in the camp, and you continally have doubts about which character is still human. The suspense is helped immensely by a intense music soundtrack by Ennio Morricone, who had obviously listened to some of Carpenters own soundtrack music.<br /><br />Kurt Russell in the leading role does a great job as MacReady, and the supporting cast which includes Keith David (Platoon, Pitch Black) and Richard Dysart all give good performances.<br /><br />This film was a high point for John Carpenters career, since whilst he has made some good films since (They Live for example) most of them have been very poor in comparison compared with this film.<br /><br />The DVD has digital 5.1 sound.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>I saw this one when it came out and have this one on my top 10 list of favorite horror movie. While it is true the effects are stunning and have yet to be matched, it is with repeat viewing that the better parts of the movie rise to the top.<br />  This is a more accurate telling of the short story classic"Who Goes There?" which was the used to make the original "Thing". In that one we had a monster from outer space that was described as a "Carrot", while here we go back to the idea that the alien can assume the shape of anything it touches. This is where the movie gets it's scariest scenes from, you never know who is on your side or who is an alien.<br />  The cast is great and once again Kurt Russell shows that he is a very fine actor and carry's this film. This is one that stays with you long after the movie is over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>The movie is about a twelve-man research team who's sitting fairly isolated in a polar-station.

Little by little the American researchers finds themselves in the precarious situation that they must try fight an alien, which possesses the ability to take over different life forms, and of course even the human. The problem becomes in this situation that it doesn?t exist a way to find out who's infected by the creature or not which leads to an extremely paranoia in the camp.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>This gooey-ooey horror/science fiction hybrid is arguably John Carpenter's best film.<p>An isolated American Weather Research Outpost in Antartica gets caught in the final crossfire of what they discover has been a battle to the death between a neighboring Norwegian Outpost and a hostile alien organism, one that can absorb and perfectly imitate any lifeform on Earth.  Too late they uncover clues that one or two of them may not be the humans they once were.  The battle begins anew as a six month long night falls and a violent storm (constantly heard howling and moaning in the background) closes in.<p>Carpenter's nihilist leanings have never been more focused than in this, his first big studio film.  His story of humanity cracking (as opposed to coming together) under pressure from a destructive threat make for seat squirming suspense.  Rob Bottin's stunning make-up and alien designs (still brilliant to this day) add visual symbolic punch to the humanity torn apart by its own fears allegory (dig the alien's phobia inspired manifestations).  Kurt Russell makes for a fine reluctant hero who flat out refuses to loose, even when he does.  Grim and disturbing, reviled by fans and critics upon its initial release (the scars of which still sting Carpenter to this day), The Thing is a classic that only gets richer with repeated viewings.  Do yourself a favor, see it in the widescreen for full effect.  An essential thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A39C7SEMCJWVOI.html">A39C7SEMCJWVOI</a><br/><p>THE THING has to be one of John Carpenter's stand-out horror films, especially in terms of special effects. The plot is simple: A team of scientists in the Ant-artic are terrorized by a shape-shifting alien being from another world. The only problem is, who's the alien, and who's human? There's plenty of suspense, drama, thrills, and over-the-top gore.

We'll strip-mine the rest of the planets later" cephalopods of "War of the Worlds", our writers, dreamers, moviemakers and other prophets have viewed the prospect of Alien company with a decidedly gimlet eye.<br /><br />Which brings us to John Carpenter's uber-bada** romp "The Thing", one of the greatest horror flicks---strike that, greatest films---of all time, as well as a fine cautionary tale about the wisdom of leaving the space heater on when you're babysitting a mutagenic horror hauled from deep space, particularly one lodged in a block of ice.<br /><br />Space Heater + Hungry, Shape-shifting Alien = Bad.<br /><br />All of which is bad news for the boys at the US Antarctic Research station, whose fun-filled existence of sitting around in thermal underwear, b*tching about government grant money and playing rustic Atari computer chess is shattered by a bunch of crazy Norwegians in a helicopter shooting at a dog.<br /><br />Crazy damned Norwegians.<br /><br />But since this is called "The Thing" and not "Those Crazy Dog-Shooting Norwegians"---well, you guessed it, something's not quite right with Fido: he gets cuddled, fed, and mixed in with the general puppy population, and before you can say "Roll Over! Play Dead" it becomes apparent that the boys from the Antarctic base aren't gonna be winning any Kennel Club awards this year.<br /><br />Things take a slightly more sinister turn when chopper pilot MacReady (the great Kurt Russell, letting the growl and the beard do the acting, and boasting a truly bada** sombrero) and a wonky scientist compadre head over to the Norwegian base (presumably to return charred pieces of the Norwegian helicopter and/or Norwegian scientists to their grieving buddies).<br /><br />Let's do a Cliff's Notes here: the Norwegian base is dead, mainly deserted---aside from a few scientists who slit their own throats and wrists rather than deal with---well, that's the question, isn't it?<br /><br />Oh, and there's a big pallet of ice in the research lab, where something---large---was being kept under observation. And some videotapes of those Crazy Norwegians in happier days forming a merry circle around what appears to be a flying saucer, buried in the ice.<br /><br />Now: whatever it was in that ice-cube made it out, but it didn't get far.

FX Wizard-in-Training Rob Bottin was just 22 years old back then, and he conjured up some of the sickest, barf-inducing effects known to man, all sorts of practical, sleight-of-hand, prosthetic goodies that make today's pallid CGI geek-artists cry Mommy. It's splendidly filthy stuff: if your stomach can make it past "The Thing", you're pretty much good to go.<br /><br />But the glory of "The Thing" isn't really about the gore---delicious as that may be. It's about the loneliness, for one: the vulnerability of this little evolved monkey, Man, taking tests, collecting data, *collating*, man---on this forsaken, ice-haunted island of solitude on a still lonelier little chunk of rock tucked into a backwater of the Milky Way.<br /><br />Unvisited, until now.<br /><br />"The Thing" is a masterwork of a film---Carpenter doesn't sound a false note, and every scene, every sequence, every delicious, paranoid little sliver of this flick tells: not one second of celluloid is padding. It's a veteran character actor's Happy Hunting Ground, too, and every one of the lonely, wonky scientists---including vets Wilford Brimley (axe-wielding Blair) and Richard Dysart (Doc Copper), and bad-when-bad-wasn't-cool Keith David (Childs)---all flesh out skeletal roles with groovy little quirks that, when all is said and done, could just be the quirks of stir-crazy eggheads---or...<br /><br />"The Thing" is a gut-clenching nugget of pure paranoid goodness: pop it in the hopper, break out the vodka, haul the blankets up to your chin while the arctic wind howls outside, and wonder for the 10th time tonight why the hell the cat is looking at you like *that*.<br /><br />Oh, and cut the space heater off.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Does anyone besides myself remember when Kurt Russell was the Disney poster boy, appearing in films like The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969), The Barefoot Executive (1971), Now You See Him, Now You Don't (1972), and The Strongest Man in the World (1975)?  What the heck happened since?  Well, perhaps in an effort to distance himself from his carefully cultivated, squeaky clean cut, all-American kid Disney image (and avoid the dreaded curse of the former child star/now out of work actor), he teamed up with writer/director/producer John Carpenter first in the made for TV movie Elvis (1979), then as the quintessential anti-hero Snake Plissken in the film Escape from New York (1981), and then again, a few years later, to do The Thing (1982), which is actually a remake of the Universal/Howard Hawks classic science fiction film The Thing from Another World (1951), which are both based on John W. Campbell's story "Who Goes There?".  Also appearing in this film is Quaker Oat man Wilford Brimley, who would have a much more amicable alien encounter in Cocoon (1985), T.K. Carter (Doctor Detroit), David Clennon (The Couch Trip), Keith David (They Live), Richard A. Dysart (Pale Rider)...whew, let me catch my breath...Charles Hallahan (Vision Quest), Richard Masur (Heaven's Gate), Donald Moffat (The Right Stuff), Joel Polis (True Believer), Thomas G. Waites (The Clan of the Cave Bear), and Peter Maloney (Desperately Seeking Susan)...also worth mentioning is one time Carpenter favorite and ex-wife Adrienne Barbeau, who doesn't actually appear in the film, but can be heard as the voice of the computer chess game Russell's character is playing in the beginning...a little bit of useless trivia for you...hey, at least I didn't mention the craft services person...who, by the way was Yervant Babasin...<br /><br />The film begins with a shot of outer space, and soon into view comes a whirling saucer, flying somewhat erratically, headed for Earth...apparently some time passes, as the year now is 1982, and we're in Antarctica.  We see a helicopter flying across the icy landscape, chasing a dog.  One of the occupants is firing a rifle at the dog, but is missing miserably...poor shot?  Perhaps not, as I figure it's hard as hell to hit a moving target from a helicopter...anyway, the chase ends at the United States National Science Institute Station 4, as the two men in the helicopter suffer a fatal mishap, but, you'll be happy to know the dog was all right...for now.  Questions arise, as the now deceased men were part of a Norwegian expedition not far from the Americans.  This prompts helicopter R.J. MacReady (played by a really hairy Russell) and another to fly over and investigate.  Seems the Norwegians found something in the ice, something better left alone, as now they're all....dead.  After returning to the camp, all soon learn perhaps sometimes a dog is not just a dog, especially when it's an alien posing as a dog...what follows next should really be seen, rather than explained here...<br /><br />This is one of those films I can watch a few times a year simply because its so well put together and entertaining, especially on a visceral level, thanks, in part, to the special effects artistry of Rob Bottin (The Fog), among others, who worked on this feature.  One thing that separated this film from the one from 1951 is the crazy-go-nuts amount of gory madness.  There's popping eyes, spurting veins, mutating and burning flesh, dripping mucus, guts a bustin', blood squirting, face eating, spider heads, tentacles slapping, bones and cartilage cracking, body mangling, and so on...if'n you're a gore hound, and you can't satisfy your monkey here, then perhaps you need some serious, professional help.  By the way, I have seen movies with much more gore, but not so much in mainstream films like this...if you've got small children, and you're looking to give them nightmarish, bedwetting nocturnal visions for at least a month, then I'd recommend this film along with Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974).  Don't get me wrong, this film isn't all about the nasty bits, as it's also an extremely tense thriller...if you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about, especially the scene when the men are testing their own blood in hopes of determining who still human.  You see, the alien has the ability to absorb other life forms, and then create an exact duplicate.  This aspect ends up driving the paranoia within the characters as they're unsure whom they can trust, and who will eat their face while they sleep.  Also, the alien is intelligent, and uses this distrust against the men, in order to further its own cause, all taking place in an enclosed, isolated environment, inducing a definite sense of claustrophobia, which only adds to further the tension and suspense.  There are plenty of shocks, also...one scene in particular was the defibulator sequence.  If you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about...and we shouldn't forget legendary composer Ennio Morricone's distinct, unsettling, and highly appropriate musical scoring.  As far as the characters go, there isn't a whole lot of time spent focused on the individuals, even though we do spend a good deal of time with Russell's character, as the story is more geared towards the group, and their efforts to recognize, contain, and destroy the imminent threat to all.  That's not to say there's no individualism among the characters, as there is, but Carpenter and the actors manage to express a lot without actually having to relate it to the audience, by actions, mannerisms, and so on...little time is wasted in this feature as things move along very quickly.  Another aspect I really liked was the attention to detail with regards to the sets and locations.  One could almost feel the pervasive cold emanating from the film, the wind cutting to the bone.  Everything worked here for me, the acting, the script, the directing, the music, the settings, the liberal carnage, and so on...again, this is a violent, graphic movie, but well worth it, if you can take it...overall, this film may be vastly different that the 1951 version, along with the original story, but I think Carpenter did carry a few, important elements in the sense of paranoia inherent within the material.<br /><br />This special edition DVD release contains a beautiful, re-mastered, anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) print, along with a clear Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track.  As far as special features, there are gobs, including an audio commentary track with the director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell, along with a featurette titled John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape (84 minutes), a production background archive, cast production photographs, production artwork and storyboards, location design, full motion and frame by frame breakdowns of the saucer and the `Blairmonster', outtakes, post production materials, and an original theatrical trailer.  All in all a superior release of an excellent film.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>In the silent cold of an Antarctic wasteland, the United States National Science Institute's Station 4 team is about to encounter a horror from beyond our galaxy. Frozen for hundreds of thousands of years, dug up and released by a nearby Norwegian research team, and now, set loose in the confines of Station 4's isolated outpost, the life-form absorbing, perfectly imitating alien creature could be disguised as anyone, man or animal. Kurt Russell is R. J. MacReady, the helicopter pilot forced into the role of leader by circumstances out of his control. As the mysterious, faceless creature assimilates member after member, it's up to MacReady and the other survivors to discover who is really who they say they are. Paranoia is the order of the day, fear and tempers boil, and each friend and coworker begins to trust each other less and less.  Finger pointing and blame throwing are added into the mix, as the ever growing death toll begins to include victims of suspicion as well. It's anyone's guess how the confrontation will end, but this much is certain: It's a hell of a thing!<br /><br />In 1982, one heck of a year for Sci-Fi, John Carpenter graced us with yet another of his sci-fi/horror masterpieces, this one a remake of 1951's "The Thing From Another World," and simply titled: "The Thing." I use the term "remake" loosely, because in fact this new film was more strongly based on the original John Campbell short story, "Who Goes There?," than the first film had ever been. In "The Thing," John Carpenter achieves his objective of creating an alien creature that is never just a "guy in a suit." When not in disguise, this completely unknown creature is a hodgepodge of every life-form it's ever imitated, and the visuals are more than a little disturbing. Naturally, "The Thing" is chock full of special effects, mainly from FX master Rob Bottin, though Stan Winston kicked in some help too. For its time, the film pushed the boundaries of gore and horror. This movie isn't all about slimy alien invasions though. More than anything, it's about isolation, desperation, and paranoia. It's a fantastic, character driven story with an all male ensemble cast, featuring Carpenter favorites like Kurt Russell and Keith David, and other notables, such as Wilford Brimley and Richard Masur. John Carpenter's presence is evident throughout, but the haunting music is the dead giveaway. The collector's edition DVD is well laden with  informative extras, despite being a single disc. The effectively eerie slip cover is also a nice touch. Featured on the disc is an 80 minute behind the scenes documentary loaded with interviews and great footage. There are plenty of other treats too, including outtakes, deleted footage, galleries and slide-shows, and the expected theatrical trailer. There's also a great commentary with director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell! Without a doubt, "The Thing" is a sci-fi classic and should be considered a necessary and welcome addition to any sci-fi/horror fan's library.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>In what has to be his best film --- even better than Halloween and Escape from New York --- Carpenter does a remake of Howard Hawke's classic 50's scifi The Thing and actually surpasses the original. Carpenter drops the Cold War-paranoia of the original and instead uses the original Campbell short story's theme of paranoia within an isolated Arctic station's group of scientists and soldiers. Where the original had an alien that was onscreen very quickly, Carpenter's alien follows the short story's version and hides itself by killing and copying members of the arctic team. Throughout the film Carpenter effectively uses this plot device to make each character distrust the other members of the team. Any one of them could be an alien in disguise as one of them. It is only during the most extreme situation will the creature reveal itself.<br /><br />The special effects used in the film is top notch even now. Now CGI was used --- this was the early 80's and CGI was still a decade away. Rob Bottin's animatronics, puppets and buckets of blood is still a high achievement for its day and still studied by students looking to enter the film effects field. One special scene where his effects are used well is a scene involving a kennel of huskie sled dogs and one alien impersonating as one of the canines.<br /><br />The acting from Kurt Russell and Keith David (voice of Goliath from the cartoon series Gargoyles) are top-notch. The acting overall for the entire ensemble cast is very good. The music score is still one of my favorites to this day. Ennio Marricone's simple bass and synthesizer compositions is simple, yet adds a palpable sense of tension, paranoia and terror as the film moves forward.<br /><br />People who are not big fans of very gory scenes and violence this film is something that they should avoid, but for those who are fans of great filmmaking, this is a must-see. Film students would do well to see a master at work. Now if he can only get back to making films just like this instead of what the studio is handing to him, I think Carpenter still has alot left in him other than more Ghosts of Mars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>I'm not one of those people who think a remake is a bad idea.  Once in a while an update is warranted and even successful.  "The Thing" is one of those films.  Director John Carpenter not only revisits the 1951 film but accepts the original story in the novella that "The Thing" has the power to invade Earthly life forms and assume their identities.  This allows Carpenter and his special effects crew to up the ante with regard to creature features and top rate technology as it existed in the `80's.  They don't shy away either.  This movie is awash in gore, goo and globulin.  And just wait until you see the creature!  "The Thing" is much more however.  There are genuine frightening moments, usually centered on the paranoia that infiltrates the camp located in Antarctica.  In a terrific opening scene, we see a helicopter chasing down a sled dog running across the beautiful white tundra (shot in British Columbia).  The dog is being shot at from the helicopter.  We don't understand.  When the dog discovers an American camp, we think all is well.  Surprisingly, the gunman continues to shoot at the dog, wounding one of the Americans by mistake.  He is then shot by the base commander.  An American pilot (Kurt Russell) and a couple scientists search for the Norwegian camp where the now dead gunman and his pilot came from to get some answers.  They find everyone dead and what appears to an icy tomb for some form of life that is no longer there.  The cast is headed by Kurt Russell in full follicle as pilot MacReady. Keith David, Wilford Brimley, David Clennon and Richard Dysart provide supporting roles and should be recognized by everyone who has watched TV since the 80's.  "The Thing" didn't do well at the box office, probably due to Ridley Scott's "Alien" coming out about the same time.  Still, this is an excellent take on an old story made with horror and science fiction gusto.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>I've watched this movie since I was a kid. I watched it a million times, over and over. I love it, I adore it. I think this movie made me search for John Carpenter's masterpieces. I have the dvd and I love it. It's one of the very best movies ever made. It's a very exciting horror movie. Special effects for it's time are amazing. Even nowadays with all these CGI and everything, this movie shows how it should be done. Not every movie with the best graphics and set of actors can compare to it. Wish it had more features and was released on blue ray. But it's awesome as it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is interrupted by a group of seemingly mad Norwegians pursuing and shooting a dog. The helicopter pursuing the dog crashes leaving no explanation for the chase. During the night, the dog mutates and attacks other dogs in the cage and members of the team that investigate. The team soon realises that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. A classic that still holds up to this very day.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>The Thing(1982-I am not sure I have seen the original) is a good suspenseful yet disgusting and gory (overdone) movie. It's Horror with Sci Fi and limbs ripped off, heads moving,dogs mutating. it creeped the hell out of me growing up and then seeing it again. I guess 82' was a good year!(I was born ;)  )</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It's been so long since I last saw this movie, I was not so sure what I expected given it is an effects movie, over a quarter of a century old.  High def transfers can really pick holes in an aging movie.  Surprise, surprise though, it's a great transfer, and the movie is still suspenseful and effectively ratches up the tension.  The in camera effects do not date as much as earlier cgi effects or optical effects have, and any lack of effectiveness is purely down to different audience expectation rather than problems with the movie. .. though those early scenes of Russell tapping away on a huge chess playing machine and the doctor's computer program investigating the prognoses for the team (which he times on his pocket watch!) all do date the movie more than the effects do.  Dark scenes with lighting by flares or torches shows up clearly, and the wide external shots of snowbound British Columbia (filling in for Antarctica) look fantastic.<br />The movie itself is a great example of festering paranoia, as the research team are infiltrated by a `thing' which can take the shape or form of anything it comes in contact with (via some extraordinary squelchy and messy intermediate phases of course).  No-one knows who is real and who is not, as exemplified by the still classic blood test scene, one of Carpenter's best.  Even the ending is one that leaves question marks the likes of which few modern `safe' movies would try.  It's as if Carpenter is more in tune with the uncertainty and paranoia of 70's America, and is unwilling to embrace the burgeoning confidence and success of the 80's.<br />It's not for the squeamish, and is of its time, but is a classic of its genre and a treat to see on Blu-ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I've loved this film for many years, so I thought it's about time I got around to reviewing it. Along with John Carpernter's other masterpiece, Halloween, The Thing is not only my favorite horror movie of all time, but it is in my top 5 if you include all genres. I was first introduced to this film by my mom when I was a teenager. She has loved it ever since she saw it in theaters back in 1982, so now I share the passion. What makes this flick so great? When there are more great things to say about a movie than fingers on your hands, you know it's something special. I'll just quickly talk about a some of them.<br /><br />The atmosphere is number one in my book. Isolated at a remote research facility in Antarctica creates an amazing claustrophobic setting. Tension really builds when you have no where to go. The music is undeniably one of the creepiest and most suspense building stuff you will ever hear. Ennio Morricone of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly fame creates another masterful composition here. Other than Jaws, no other film's score has done more with two bass notes. Fear of the unknown plays a huge part, especially the first time you see it (I wish I could erase the film from memory and watch it for the first time again). Not being able to trust anyone but yourself becomes the motto. The special effects are way before the days of CGI and 27 years later they still look very impressive. The gore level is quite high and disturbing. Some images will forever be burned in my mind. Maybe most importantly of all, this film is actually scary. I still get chills watching this alone at night with the lights off and I've seen it more than ten times. Just thinking about what might have went on at the destroyed Norwegian camp is enough to make the hairs on your arm stand up. There is not a weak link in the cast. Everyone is believable and you never for once think you are watching a bunch of actors. Even with someone as familiar as Kurt Russell, who wisely doesn't overplay the part. I also loved the ending. Sure it's a cliffhanger, but it still leaves that element of mystery that kept the movie going from the start. Pure class.<br /><br />So do you think I like John Carpenter's remake of The Thing? I was trying to think of some flaws, but a few minutes went by and I gave up. The bottom line is, this belongs in every DVD collection.<br /><br />The Blu-ray itself looks fantastic, especially when compared to the old 1998 release I have. It was worth the upgrade.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape From New York) directs this scary and thrilling movie about a space alien who has the power to attain any life form it wishes by copying the cells of the victim.<br /><br />Kurt Russell (R.J.

Pilot RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) is the main character who takes charge of a small research group in the Antarctic. When a frozen unknown "THING" is found, the group decides to bring it inside to examine. Naturally it thaws out and comes back to life and all hell breaks loose. When it's discovered that the alien can imitate any living form, the men begin to distrust and suspect each other. In the end, only 2 survive and they're both trying to figure out if the other guy is human or alien. Great supporting cast with Wilford Brimley (yeah, the old "Quaker Oats" guy) as Blair, TK Carter as Nauls, and Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper. Some great scenery including lots of snow and beautiful mountains... and you know it's cold outside from the breath of the actors (although you know it's not 40 degrees below like MacReady states... somehow, if it was, he would have more than an unzipped leather flight jacket on anytime he goes outside). Good special effects for 1982... I have to remind myself - this movie is "decades" old. From the alien spliting open a dog's face (and popping out of the dog), to a crawling head, to a human's chest cavity opening up and biting the Dr's arms off, to the simple few drops of blood jumping out of a pitre dish - it's enough to keep you entertained through the picture. At the time of it's release, I was surprised that the usually safe & secure Kurt Russell would take such a different role in such a different type of movie (Sci-Fi/Horror).

"The Thing' starring Kurt Russell is older than all of them, coming out in 1982.  I remember seeing it for the first time on a VHS rented tape on a tiny 19" TV with its tinny speakers, and it still gave my ex wife and a friend the chills making us jump in surprise at many scenes.<br /><br />'The Thing' on Blu Ray brags of an excellent video and audio transfer, and it can keep on bragging.  The Video transfer couldn't be any better.  The colors pop, even the blacks.  In the beginning of the movie there is a scene of the radio room, and the back of the hand held transmitter displays a deep reflective black that is rare.  I saw no grain, artifacts or anything else that would take away from this fine transfer.<br /><br />The DTSHD audio was as clean as one could hope for with excellent steering to the discreet channels where appropriate.  I was surprised that, for most of the movie, there was very little of the LFE channel coming into action, however, as I said, the audio is lossless and quite wonderful.<br /><br />I have had the Standard Def disc for some time now, but am ultra pleased that I bought the blu ray version.

Overlooked and trashed by critics upon it's release, this movie's fanbase has grow immensely as well as the respect this film now receives. The critics didn't like Blade Runner or The Empire Strikes Back either so who cares what these self righteous jerks think, history nearly always proves them wrong. This film creates an overwhelming feeling of distrust and paranoia better than any film before it or since. The special effects are impressive considering the scale and the decade in which they were done. Some have written this off as a gore film, which it certainly is not. The elements of gore in this film actually augment the level of terror and fear. This movie builds it's anxiety level to record heights by the final act. Great acting, great direction, great script, great effects. This film is a good case study in the reason to do remakes, in the right hands they can be done very well indeed, in fact at times...better.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>There are few filmmakers who can make pictures of incredible drama and magnitude...John Carpenter is one of them.

Its set at an arctic research base where a cast of characters including Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley stumble upon an alien life form and the results are gory and jarring.

Too bad this film was released the same time as the family oriented E.T., it would have done better, but that stupid candy eating creature had the whole world's attention. I am not knocking E.T., but this is an adult film, made to scare you to death. It delivers. The fx is incrdible, the then 22 year old Rob Bottin, (fx genious), is fantastic. The defibrillation scene is my personal best. UNBELIEVABLE STUFF. Kurt Russell plays his part to the best. Guessing who is and isn't infected keeps you on the edge of the seat. Ennio Morricone's score, (synthesizer), is brilliant and downright spooky. This is one creepy and eyepoping film, Carpenter is God in the Horror genre. Flip the lights off, grab a loved one and be prepared to be astonished, I was.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  John Carpenter<br />Cast:  Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart.<br />Running Time:  108 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<p>This remake of the 1951 classic is so incredibly different and much more grotesque that it bears almost no relation to the original except the title.  The John Carpenter version harnesses the same premise--an otherworldly creature inhabits members of an army radar station crew and proceeds to murder, eat, dismember, etc. all those in the area.  Kurt Russell plays the main protagonist and gives a fine performance in the lead role.<p>John Carpenter (&quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot;) is a pure master of suspense, using a tense musical score and rigid, unique camera angles for many of his shots.  He also uses much more gore than usual--particularly the scene in which the creatures bursts out of the dog and gruesomely transforms into something new.  Superb makeup and special effects make &quot;The Thing&quot; a disturbing, atmospheric tale of the unknown.  Not much of a plot or theme, just a good old fashioned story with the 1980's gory technology.  Considered by some to a modern classic; considered by others to be a nasty, cruel rendition of a film that did not need a remake.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>THE THING is the slimiest, oozingest, drippingest horror / sci-fi movie ever made! It is also one of the finest. Kurt Russell is cast in the role of his career (yes, better than his role as escape from new york's "Snake") as Macready, a no-nonsense helicopter pilot with an arctic research group. The opening scene shows an alien craft crash-landing on earth in some distant past. The next scene is the eerie "doghunt", where the world's weirdest husky is saved from it's norwegian (scientists from another research facilty a few miles away) pursuers by our unsuspecting heroes. Of course, the poor doggy is taken back to the base, where bizarre things begin to happen right away. It seems that our canine friend was not a dog at all, but an extraterrestrial entity with the ability to attack, assimilate, and assume the identity of any living creature. Like a monster virus, it jumps from person to person, becoming an almost perfect copy of it's now dead victim. Put this together with the fact that this takes place in a totally isolated location, and you've got the best paranoid nightmare ever filmed! The tension, suspicion, and terror are palpable (In fact, aside from the arctic setting, THE THING has more in common with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS than it does with the original classic film THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD). The alien transformation scenes are as awesome as they are disgusting. This is John Carpenter's magnum opus of slithery goo! THE THING is a downright disturbing frightfest. Even Wilford Brimley is scary! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>What is indeed one of the goriest films of recent memory, John Carpenter's 1982 incarnation of the The Thing shocked, appalled, and disgusted audiences nationwide while gathering much acclaim from Carpenter's fans and horror lovers alike.  Carpenter's favorite actor, Kurt Russell stars as one of a group of scientists that discover the body of an alien being frozen in the arctic for thousands of years.  What unfolds is that the alien can take any form it chooses, and what results is some very gory images and disturbing scenes (courtesy of Rob Bottin with some of the best makeup ever used in a movie, especially considering this was made 20 years ago), and there is a lot of suspense and tension, giving the movie a very eerie atmosphere as well.  While some consider the ending a bit of a letdown, there really was no other way to end it (except the alternate ending talked about in the making of special feature), and this remains one of Carpenter's better films.  The special features of the DVD are a nice touch as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>Bluray is of unbelievably awesome quality. PQ and AQ is superb.

However when I watched it again a couple of years ago, I found it not as good as Aliens 2. It still have some good suspenseful moments. The special effects are not as good as those of Aliens 2.<br /><br />It's definitely worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I was feeling seriously, physically sick watching this movie, and that's not a good thing! I'm sure my groans could be heard for miles, and I'm pretty sure I missed a couple of scenes, due to hiding my face in the chair. I could have done without seeing a dog's head splitting open. There's blood and body parts flying all over - arms are bitten off, heads detach and one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The stuff of nightmares if I'd been a few years younger.<br /><br />I'd previously never heard of this film, nor did I know that Kurt Russell played a character called MacReady. I thought that was pretty cool. Not so keen on the beard though. Ugh!<br /><br />The only quibble I have with this movie, is there appears to be a strictly no females policy on board somewhere! There are no female characters in the film. The only female presence in the movie is in the voice of MacReady's chess computer and the contestants seen on the game show that Palmer watches. A scene containing a blow-up doll was filmed and then left on the cutting room floor. Additionally, one of the crew was a woman but she fell ill during the outdoor shoot and was replaced with a man. Why no women? It totally reminded me of Ghosts of Mars - just better. And there were women in that.<br /><br />For a scene where a character's arms are severed, a real-life double amputee stand-in was used wearing a mask in the likeness of the character. The audience focuses on the bloody stumps while the mask goes unnoticed. In the scene where Norris' (Charles Hallahan) head separates from his body, special-FX designer Rob Bottin used highly inflammable materials for the construction of interior of the head and neck models. During the shoot John Carpenter decided that, for continuity reasons, they needed some flames around the scene. Without thinking they lit a fire bar and the whole room, which by now was filled with inflammable gasses, caught fire. Nobody got hurt, but the entire special effects model, on which Bottin had worked several months, was destroyed.<br /><br />You can literally FEEL how cold it is watching this movie, and I swear, I was feeling the cold!<br /><br />Hollywood are getting bad for doing this - releasing a DVD, and then releasing a bigger, better & badder version a few months later. It's not so bad if it's years after the original release, but this is getting unbelievable. Sometimes if you compare the DVDs, there's hardly any difference, and sometimes, you'll have to keep both DVDs, cos they both have different extras. The extras on this include: commentary by director John Carpenter and Kurt Russell; documentary "John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape" featuring interviews with John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, make-up designer Rob Bottin, matte artist Albert Whitlock, and other cast and crew members, plus outtakes, work-in-progress special effects footage and behind-the-scenes footage; behind-the-scenes photographs; storyboards and conceptual art; and annotated production archive.<br /><br />If you're a huge fan of gore, that isn't really showing its age, then go ahead and get this. Once seen, it won't be forgotton.</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>Being a Huge John Carpenter fan and an Even Bigger Kurt Russel fan, I didn't need much prodding to purchase "The Thing - Collectors Edition" on DVD, (even though I had Never seen it) and even though it was a Gamble, it was a Gamble that paid off.<p>Kurt Russel plays part of an American Research team in Antarctica, who seem to be Infested with some kind of Alien Species, as The Thing infiltrates members of the group, (using their bodies like pods) the members left alive begin to fight amongst themselves. It's becomes a "Nobody trust Nobody" scenario that Descends into an Orgy of Violence and Carnage. (if that doesn't excite you, nothing will) <p>Kurt's makes his Character the Strong Silent type, like "Snake Plissken", his character in John Carpenters "Escape from New York". The Entire Cast takes it all Very, Very Seriously, which helps make the film Genuinely Scary. John Carpenter help by getting Maximum Thrills out of the Scenario, the Sets and the Special Effects. Rob Bottin's Alien Effects are some of the most Ingenious Creations in Cinema History.  <p>These days, Scary, Serious Monster movies are quite rare. Films like "Deep Rising" and "The Mummy" are played more for laughs, "Anaconda" and "Lake Placid" are about as Scary as "Attack of the Teletubies", "The Thing" is Different. It is a Deadly Serious, Genuinely Scary Thriller that works Just as well Today as it did in the 80's.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Of the huge crop of directors that came out of the late 60s/early 70s "film school generation", it is John Carpenter who has suffered perhaps the most neglect overall.  A lot of that has to do with the fact that his films, following the success of 1984's STARMAN, are largely unenterprising B-movies with large scale budgets and a lot of overtly hammy acting.  But Carpenter also made taut and suspenseful films like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, THE FOG, the original HALLOWEEN, and, perhaps most provocatively, THE THING.<br /><br />Ostensibly a remake of director Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic of the same name, Carpenter's film is more like a reworking, since it goes back to the original source material--namely the story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell--for its depiction of an American research team in Antarctica confronted with a shape-changing alien that had been frozen under the ice for 100,000 years, until it was dug up by Norwegian counterparts.  The men involved, including Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart, and Donald Moffatt, are at the mercy of this thing, and inevitably at the mercy of each other, because they don't know who is human and who has morphed into "something else."  Carpenter cagily explores this for all the suspense it's worth, as was his way in HALLOWEEN and THE FOG; and the coda, with Russell and David sitting in the extreme cold as the camp burns down, is chillingly ambiguous in the manner of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 classic STRAW DOGS.<br /><br />Usually when Carpenter's THE THING is talked about, it is talked about in terms of the extremely gory special make-up effects work of Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on THE FOG, and also on Joe Dante's 1980 werewolf opus THE HOWLING.  And these effects are quite spectacular, though they are also still stomach-turning at times as well.  But as a result, THE THING would be nothing more than a high-end splatter film if the story, direction, and acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, all of those elements are.  Russell shows the kind of Everyman credibility that would serve him well much later on in films like TOMBSTONE and BREAKDOWN.  The other special effects work is provided by Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS) and Roy Arbogast (CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND), with a fine synth-laden score by Ennio Morricone, who had composed the ultra-memorable scores for Sergio Leone's westerns, including THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, and the magisterial ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.<br /><br />THE THING, when released by Universal in June 1982, was not initially a success because, for whatever reason, the studio released it right after it had released the far more family-friendly Spielberg classic E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL; and much of the horror box office for that year was going to another Spielberg-produced (but not directed) movie, POLTERGEIST.  These things, combined with the largely negative critical reviews it got, seriously damaged THE THING's box office prospects.  But time and events have made the film into a memorable, extremely gory, but also extremely intelligent, study of psychological paranoia.<br /><br />After his following two films (CHRISTINE; STARMAN), Carpenter arguably degenerated into something of a hack.  It's a shame that this happened, because THE THING is, if not a masterpiece, then certainly one of the better films of its type from the 1980s.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>In what has to be his best film --- even better than Halloween and Escape from New York --- Carpenter does a remake of Howard Hawke's classic 50's scifi The Thing and actually surpasses the original. Carpenter drops the Cold War-paranoia of the original and instead uses the original Campbell short story's theme of paranoia within an isolated Arctic station's group of scientists and soldiers. Where the original had an alien that was onscreen very quickly, Carpenter's alien follows the short story's version and hides itself by killing and copying members of the arctic team. Throughout the film Carpenter effectively uses this plot device to make each character distrust the other members of the team. Any one of them could be an alien in disguise as one of them. It is only during the most extreme situation will the creature reveal itself.<br /><br />The special effects used in the film is top notch even now. Now CGI was used --- this was the early 80's and CGI was still a decade away. Rob Bottin's animatronics, puppets and buckets of blood is still a high achievement for its day and still studied by students looking to enter the film effects field. One special scene where his effects are used well is a scene involving a kennel of huskie sled dogs and one alien impersonating as one of the canines.<br /><br />The acting from Kurt Russell and Keith David (voice of Goliath from the cartoon series Gargoyles) are top-notch. The acting overall for the entire ensemble cast is very good. The ensemble's gradual descent into paranoia as they realize just exactly what they've got hunting them in their compound is near perfect in its execution. Mid-way through the film, the audience has put alot in stock in caring for these characters. There's not one throwaway character in the cast and that is rare in an ensemble-suspense film.<br /><br />The music score is still one of my favorites to this day. Ennio Morricone's simple bass and synthesizer compositions are simple, yet adds a palpable sense of tension, paranoia and terror as the film moves forward. Considering that Carpenter always scores his own films, it seemed like a gamble giving over the reins of scoring this film to another. The end result shows that Carpenter gambled correctly.<br /><br />People who are not big fans of very gory scenes and violence this film is something that they should avoid, but for those who are fans of great filmmaking, this is a must-see. Film students would do well to see a master at work. Now if he can only get back to making films just like this instead of what the studio is handing to him, I think Carpenter still has alot left in him other than more Ghosts of Mars.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>lost in the cold regions of some other country..Russell and co. battle evil aliens that..when the horror begins the killings are gruesome but icky and they leave this movie a bore..Russell and Keith David surviving at the end was a good idea but we couldve did without the blood pussing out..a head crawling on roots and all that junk...a john carpenter dissapointment really</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>There is so much to rave about when it comes to John Carpenter's "The Thing", whether its the excellent acting, the chilling musical score, the eye popping special effects, the phenominal ending....I and it appears countless reviewers can't say enough about this 80's classic. In today's remake frenzied Hollywood, "The Thing" really stands out, if for no other reason than you can tell the man behind the remake loved the original film. There are several scenes in Carpenter's film that pay homage to the original movie, like when the Norwegian scientists are seen measuring the ship in the ice by standing in a circle, or when Mac discovers the thawed out block of ice that once contained the monster. Compare what Carpenter did with "The Thing" to Spielburg's recent "War of the Worlds" remake. Even though they are both remakes, Carpenter's feels original while "War of the Worlds" feels processed and approved by some board somewhere, there wasn't anything new brought to the table with "War of the Worlds". And while "The Thing"'s special effects were groundbreaking, and innovative at the time, the film didn't rely upon them to carry it along. As a horror fan I am glad we got to see all of the gory transformations in Carpenter's film, but really if you were to remove all of the gory scenes from "The Thing", there is still more than enough meat to the story and plot to carry it along. If you were to remove the special effects from "War of the Worlds" most people would have left the theater about halfway through. "War of the Worlds" was all about the effects first, and storytelling second. "The Thing" still stands as one of the best remakes to come out of Hollywood, and deserves to be called a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Maybe you'll disagree but I think it really is the best of his works. And I guess noone will argue that it's the best body-snatching movie ever. We,ve seen a lot of aliens intruding our bodies and killing us slowly but these ones are definately the most dreadful.<br />Made not on a big budget "The Thing" (as many of horror movies of that time) still appalls you. Young director should learn how to make horror movies watching the best examples of 80's, and one of them is "The Thing".<br />Special effects will make your jaw drop, the cast doesn't consist of major stars but acting is just awesome. Because of those small rooms and surrounding winter storm you may suffer a severe attack of claustrophobia. "The Thing" is so real!<br />Besides there are plenty of bonus features on this DVD. You'll spend a lot of time exploring them all. 80-minute documentary is very informative and interesting. Not an edition to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>Rob Bottin deserved an oscar for his fx work on the thing, he was ahead of his time and the obvious standard for future horror movies to come (Savini excluded). I love the paranoia that was created by Carpenter in the fact that nobody knew who was who or who was what. The movie has an overall feeling of a serious movie, no one liners, no quirkey characters just straight action and mystery.The Thing has earned it's spot in horror movie history as one of the best and also a pioneer in fx.Kurt Russell should be proud!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Fans of John W. Campbell's classic novella, "The Thing From Another World" will recognize Carpenter's rendition as a far more accurate cinematic retelling than the 1950s "The Thing From Another World" (Although it was cool to see James Arness as the monster in that one!). Carpenter's grisly but realistic flick remains a classic 20 years after its release. A must for the serious fantasy aficionado's collection</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I love the old James Arness The Thing, so I was skeptical when John Carpenter brought out a new version.<p>I was delighted, however, when I saw that he wisely crafted a story much closer to the original story, John Campbell's classic &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; that was the basis for both films.<p>Both films stand on their own and are completely different.  I think the older film has the edge on suspense and class, but the Carpenter version has much to like as well.<p>While familiar now, the special effects here were new at the time and state-of-the-art.  They are still shocking.  Overdone?  Yeah, probably (I'm especially no fan of the excess goo used at the time) but still effective.  The sets are terrific (especially the ruined Norwegian compound, the spaceship etc.). A nice isolated, claustrophobic feel to it all.<p>The DVD commentary with Carpenter and Kurt Russell is a hoot.  You can tell they had a ball making this.  Kurt Russell also loves what I think is one of the best and funniest lines ever delivered in a movie when David Clennon sees the head sprout legs and scurry off.  It's worth it to see the film just for that moment.<p>Good scares and intriguing plot, well crafted and acted.  What more do you want?</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>The Film is, without a doubt, a masterpiece of it's genre. The key however, is the FX  done by Rob Bottin. The Director admits that the work done by Rob Bottin, and also by the genius himself, Stan  Winston ( who admits that this film is basically Bottin's baby), makes things easier for the director when he discovered that Bottin's driven and maniacally perfectionist FX  work allows the actors, and the director to do their job knowing that they are doing so with a superb backdrop.<br />The location is great. The FX  are great. The Matte  Painting work is beyond superb.<br />The  Collectors  edition DVD  basically gives you thorough main shows, the film, the making of Featurette, and the commentary.<br />Through these features, you discover how the material was put together, how Bottin created what was such a superb pre-CGI master-work, and thereby a place for himself in cinematic history.<br />There are additional extras other than the three main shows I mention, but if you only watch the Three "Shows" I refer to, the DVD  more than pays for itself.<br />The packing of the DVD  is great, and it just feels like a work done by a Fan. The stories related by the actors are excellent, and the work of the masterful  Wilford Brimley, Kurt Russell, and the rest of the actors, make this a brilliant film, if only to see that a great film, done with passion and verve, can be made without the computers, without the Avid editor, but with passion, heart, and good old fashioned acting, skill, visual  dexterity, and a masterly script.<br />If you like the film THE THING, you are sure to love the Collectors  edition. Make sure to see it with a Surround sound 5.1  system, since the visual transfer is equally as brilliant as the audio.<br />ENJOY</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece!<br /><br />I watched this movie fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS!<br /><br />Somehow, "The Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.<br /><br />First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release! In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror movies being re-made these days; this is one re-make that was done right and at a time when re-makes weren't being mass produced (as they are in today's market).<br /><br />Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest. The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking, realistic, and awesome!<br /><br />Quick plot summary:<br /><br />A US research team working in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted. They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer. By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.<br /><br />They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and quickly began to turn against their colleagues.<br /><br />Will they find WHO amongst them is the "Thing"?<br />Can anyone kill this creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire civilization?<br /><br />Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John Carpenter's "The Thing".<br /><br />I cant recommend this movie enough!  Enjoy!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>The great thing about this movie is the fact that there is an extreme sense of paranoia. John Carpenter does a fantastic job of making it frightening but not resorting to a bunch of teen slashers. Kurt Russell does an awesome job and the film doesn't rely on the top stars in the world to get the big bucks. It is done masterfully from start to finish. Yea, it's that good.<p>Basically a lone outpost discovers a terrifying &quot;virus&quot;. This virus is interesting in that the make-up department does a really great job with it. They make it look scary and make the sense of dread even cooler. This movie is great, but &quot;the fog&quot; is still a little scarier.</p></br></body></html>

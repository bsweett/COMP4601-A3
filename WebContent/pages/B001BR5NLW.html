He is the driving force that takes this movie to a whole new level. If you've been looking for something new in your science fiction than this is it. Much like its little brother, Pitch Black, its a typical science fiction plot, a race of intergalactic people run around the universe taking over planets. Riddick has been brought into this mess against his will. In keeping with his character, he is always driven by one thing: looking out for # 1. This is the first chapter to a possible series of films about this really fun, butt kicking character.<p>The special effects are pretty standard. Although there is an annoying fuzziness to it all that isn't always pleasing to the eyes. The supporting cast is decent enough to back up the awesome screen presence of Vin Diesel who carries this picture from one thrilling scene to the next. His  dead pan expression brings back those 80's one man armies with glistening pecs and cool one liners. It plays out as a very introductory plot leaving much to be explained later. It doesn't over burden itself with a huge epic story all in one film, instead it keeps things small as we watch Riddick on his the adventures that lead him to the necromonger king. <p>The films end is truly inspired. If you love this character you will have a big grin on your face at the possibilites the next two films may have in store. It does have its flaws though, the action scenes are edited in a very chopper manner, and the absence of sound in one big fight scene is obvious and makes the scene feel empty. This was surely done to secure the PG-13 rating. We can probably expect an uncut directors edition on DVD.<p>Granted if you don't already love Riddick from Pitch Black alot of this film may be too hard to swallow, but if you lose yourself on this ride you will come out truly satisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Good action film with plenty of special effects. Film moves a long evenly with no gaps in action and plot? Decent enough. Dialogue, acting, ok. Of course this builds on "Pitch Black", which is also a good action film. Riddick is an interesting character and actually one I like although he is a "bad" guy to some. Recommend for action, effects.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>Great Sci Fi movie and story.  As is the case with many sci fi movies, the weaker acting is a bit of a distraction but the solid story and exceptional special effects easily carry the viewer through to the end.  I was tempted to upgrade to Blu-Ray but the widescreen DVD is exceptionally sharp, rivaling SuperBit and THX transfers on the high def screen.  The additional footage of the director's cut definitely adds significance to the story.  If you keep a Sci Fi movie library, The Chronicles of Riddick is a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>After fending off a bounty hunter, Riddick decides to pay a visit on those that put a price on his head.  There he runs into old acquaintances and meets an Elemental (Judy Dench).  There is a terrible danger to the planet and they feel Riddick can help.  The danger is a group known as Necromongers.  They basically believer there is an underverse were death is perfect unlike the flawed life of the universe.  Their leader, the Marshal, has actually been to the underverse and returned a changed man.  They travel from planet to planet recruiting new members and killing all who do not join.  Now Riddick is on their next target.<br /><br />Riddick's unique brand of self interest and order drives him through the movie and the conflict with the seemingly unstoppable foe.  We see political intrigue among the upper ranks of the invaders.  We learn more of Riddick's past (no mention of his being a government trained assassin).  We learn how Riddick and the Necromongers crossed paths in the past.  We learn almost nothing of the Elementals.  It all comes together in a somewhat confusing ending that leaves plenty of loose ends and unanswered questions.<br /><br />This is a strange and confusing film.  Much of it seems like there was no real overall plan.  The Necromonger Marshal is one of the anomalies.  The Marshal is replaced every few years yet the current Marshal is practically a god.  Many of the Necromongers seem a little preoccupied by the pleasures of life.  I would like to have known a little more about the Elementals but there is almost nothing about them.  Then there is the ending.  Just what does it bode?  How does it resolve the situation?  What happens next?  We don't really know and it is frustrating.  Plenty of action and plot pieces but it just didn't seem to hold togther they way it should.  But if you like action, you will find plenty of it here.</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>I had never heard of this movie before I saw it in a store. I already had a handfull of choices and I was stocking up for travel. I saw the cover and thought I might enjoy a sci-fi action movie so I bought it.<br /><br />It was a mistake FOR ME. Apparently this is a sequel and I was missing out on the origins of the story. The definitely handicapped my understanding and enjoyment of the events protrayed. What I did see was a fairly lavish action movie with some great lines and some great stunts. It meant very little to me, however. I think I need to see the prequel to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />You may want this movie but you should want its predecessor first.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Riddick, brings back to the screen the story of the Furian fugitive as he tries to avoid bounty hunters while at the same time trying to prevent a new enemy, the Necromongers, from taking over the Underverse.  It is an action-packed adventure with significant improvements compared to the prequel, Pitch Black:<br /><br />1) Vin Diezel talks much more in this movie; he has way more lines.<br /><br />2) There are better special effects, and<br /><br />3) Overall, it's a better plot.<br /><br />Nevertheless:<br /><br />1) There are still multiple gaps in the plot; though Dark Fury- The Chronicles of Riddick is the missing link between the two movies, there is very little information given about the Elementals and the mysterious religion of the Necromongers, thus leaving the audience in the dark.<br /><br />2) Riddick, surprisingly, gets his butt kicked left and right in Pitch Black by the "jock" bounty hunter, but in Chronicles there is this transformation that takes place and he becomes next to invincible.<br /><br />3) Another setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it), which is just average, and at times below average.<br /><br />In conclusion, the film will provide an evening's entertainment, though it's no masterpiece...</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Others may,or may not agree,but I think this is the best sci-fi film to come along in a long while. Despite some of it's short commings(this is not an oscar winner by any means) it is still entertaining to the last.<br /><br /> The Riddick Chronicals by far surpass in quality what George Lucas has been attempting to do  with his newest Star Wars franchise.Instead of the film being all about special effects,it mearly uses them as part of the canvas to paint the environment and set the scene.<br /><br /> The last Star Wars film was so utterly pathetic in dialog&plot,all the best digital effects ILM provided could'nt help save that dog from drowning.I don't care what the film grossed in the U.S,or overseas...it was a terrible film.Reading the Sunday Funnies is far more entertaining.Sorry George,but despite me being an avid sci-fi fan&Star Wars junkie in my younger years,your last two films barely pass for movies of the week.<br /><br /> The Riddick Chronicals keeps up a good pace,great action, and the special effects don't interfere with the story.Riddick is an exceedingly interesting character with more room to grow&develope,as well as the the Necromongers being an evil&and aggressive race on a quest to covert people of alien worlds to their beliefs,or be anihalated.It kind of mirrors some of our current events happening accross the globe.<br /><br /> There is suppose to be some more films to follow this one,and I can only hope they keep the momentum going.It will be interesting to see what lies in store for Riddick, and where the storyline goes.I  am looking forward for the next film.I highly reccommend this film, if you have'nt seen Pitch Black, you should see it before seeing the Riddick Chronicles.Whether you are a Sci-Fi fan,a Vin Diesel fan, or not...you will not be disapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In 2000, we were introduced to Riddick (Diesel), a criminal who can see in the dark.  With the video success of "Pitch Black" and the interest of Vin Diesel, a sequel was inevitable.  "Chronicles" finds Riddick five years later, and still on the run from bounty hunters.  When he crosses paths with old friend Inam (David), he learns that he may be the only one who is able to stop the Necromongers, lead by Lord Marshall (Feore).  The Necromongers are gearing up to destroy Inam's planet, and Riddick has landed there just in time.  He soon is on his way to save Jack (Davalos), a friend from the previous movie that may be able to help him out.  Throw in Dame Judi Dench, and you even have a touch of class in this sci-fi action extravaganza.<p>Vin Diesel could very well have a real franchise on his hands here if "Chronicles" is able to make a dent at the box office.  Filled with action and amazing special effects, "Chronicles" seems poised to do just that.  The ending also provides a jumping off point to further adventures, so don't be surprised to see more of Riddick in a few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Director Twohy fancies himself a bit of an auteur. I wouldn't go that far (Dune/ Farscape, et al) but his idiosyncratic style rather won me over. I'm not sure if the character of Riddick (from Pitch Black) ever justifies the portentious deification Twohy affords him, but the possibly tragic ending is none the less intriguing. Beautifully shot, the story dares to be dark although I fear it may be too lumbering and lugabrious to withstand too many repeat viewings. I do think it was a mistake to recast Jack. The original actress had huge Bambi eyes and it's difficult to connect emotionally with a different actress. Finally, watch out for a cheeky Roy Batty/Rutger Hauer tribute scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>As a sequal to the original movie "Pitch Black" this movie was completely different. It didn't follow the thread of the first one at all. Riddick's character is different, and there are too many things that are not explained. Just thrown out there for the public to make of it what they will. Such as Riddick's feelings for Kera, or where the Necromongers came from in the first place. Why did they just of a sudden pop up in the universe? Other than that, the movie was not too bad. The actors where ok, not great, just ok. The planets where pretty cool, especially the prison on the one sun where Kera was held. But the movie certainly did not showcase the best of Vin Diesel's talents. His lines left you pretty unsure at what they where trying to get at, or why he even bothered saying them.<br /><br />Definatly better than the first one however, at least you could watch it a second time without being bored because you knew the entire plot. Still, it tended to drag. I think Twohy went for two hours without first wondering how he was going to do it and make it stay interesting. Make sure you rent this movie first before committing to buying, unless you saw and liked the original.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  It has been a long time since I've seen a Science Fiction film as ambitious and pumped with adrenaline as this one.  The huge sets and spectacular special effects are glorious, and the cast contains some interesting and highly memorable characters.  Although, this film is certainly not for everyone.  Those who expect perfection will be summarily disappointed; but those who don't mind the occasional flaw as long as the story moves forward at a brisk and entertaining pace should be enthralled.  I love reading epic Sci-fi novels that encompass multi-culture conflicts on a variety of planets host to a multitude of characters whose presence lingers on long after the final page is turned.  That is what has been accomplished here: the ultimate in Space Opera laced with fantastic action sequences and a lead character you just can't take your eyes off of.  There are many film influences apparently "borrowed" for this story, such as "Dune," "Star Trek," "Conan the Barbarian," and even a few excellent ideas practically stolen from the animated film "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within."  The integration of all these sources should collide but they instead merge into an intoxicating brew of dazzling visuals and non-stop action sequences.  There is a scene in this film that I want to relate, in part, due to the fact it reminded me of another great scene from "The Pianist" which won the Oscar for Best Director for Roman Polanski.  In "The Pianist" there is a scene where a tank fires a shell into the vacinity of the main character and explodes; all of a sudden the sound cuts out except for a high-pitched tone and muffled footfalls leaving the viewer with an unprecedented feeling of being in same room.  In "The Chronicles of Riddick" director David Twohy uses a similar idea as an explosion hits and the entire battle is silenced, the score is absent, and all that can be heard is the muffled sound of armored soldiers crashing against the rocks.  It was another remarkable sample taken and seamlessly woven into the framework of this wholly under-rated film.  To get more background information on a couple of the characters in this film, especially Riddick, it is a good idea to check out the film "Pitch Black" first.  Both films are worth owning, this sequel starting up the story five years after "Pitch Black" ends.  This is a thoroughly entertaining film filled with fine action sequences, superb special effects, and an epic tale that spans three planets and all the space between.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>This is an interesting followup to the Pitch Black movie.  A movie that was probably designed to be standalone, but generated such a cult following of the classic antihero Riddick, that producers were screaming for a followup.  Though it definitely suffers from plot oriented flaws,, it seems to survive all of them and end up being a highly enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Goths are conquering the universe.  Well not technically speaking, but a group called the Necromongers, a strange theocracy are going planet to planet and forcing others to either submit to their ideals and join them, or die. They are preparing to go and conquer their version of the holy lands called the "underverse".  Their leader"the grand marshal" has been there and returned something not quite human.  There is a rumor that a Furion will defeat them.  But that seems unlikely since the Necromongers killed them all off.<br /><br />This is where Riddick enters.  He has been on remote planets to escape from bounty hunters.  When a group of hunters finally catch up with him he returns to civilization to figure out how they found him so easily.  So he goes to find the one person he told where he was going, a familar face from the last movie.  Then he discovers that it is more than just law departments looking for him.  He is apparently a child of destiney, though this is a destiney that he wants no part of.<br /><br />This was a highly enjoyable movie.  It suffered from some flaws that slowed it down a bit.  The bad guys get little explanation, they are shown as fanatics, highly organized, possibly brainwashed, and high tech.  The Lord Marshal is shown to be supernatural in some way, but his character unfortunately doesn't get much screen time.<br /><br />A lot of characters aren't developed as they should be, making them seem more like plot devices than people.<br /><br />The plot seems pretty thin, but it feels as though there is going to be a sequel.  It is practically implied in the name, chronicles of riddick.<br /><br />But overall the movie succedes in being a good action film, and science fiction.  The special effects and cinematography are all top notch.  The action sequences are well filmed and exciting.  Plus Vin Diesel is in top form as Riddick.  Who is offically in the ranks of classic anti heroes(ie: snake plisken, Han Solo, Leon the Professional, Frank Castle, and Blade).  The humor is dark and the characters gritty and mostly believable.  In short, watch it, you won't be moved, but you will enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I was really looking forward to THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK. PITCH BLACK was one of the most innovative sci-fi movies to arrive in theatres in a long time and it is, after all, the movie that really "made" Van Diesel. However, I was somewhat disappointed by the film. The movie tried to fit in all the surviving characters from PITCH BLACK and place them in a life and death situation with an invading species that is threatening the known universe, assimilating and annhiliating entire worlds at the same time on their quest to find the Underverse. Riddick isn't quite the same person he was five years ago when he blasted off from that planet of darkness. He's got compassion in his soul now. Nevertheless, he's still as smart, speedy, and strong as ever. With a kick-but character like Riddick and a fairly decent story line, you would think the movie would be top notch.<br /><br />But, it's not. Instead of building on the originality and creativity of the first movie, THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK tries for something safer and rips off some of the best stories in epic sci-fi (the Necromongers are a rip off of STAR TREK's Borg and much of the second half of the movie is suspiciously similar to DUNE). Not only that, but though the movie CAN stand on it's own as a movie, I don't think there are many people out there who will enjoy the movie if they haven't seen PITCH BLACK and know who Riddick is, which kind of defeats the purpose.<br /><br />Still, the film was interesting enough to keep my attention and even though it's largely a set-up for a third film in the series, there's enough there to make me watch it again and want to see the next movie to see how things play out. There aren't many movie sequels that can do that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>The main problem with this film is the goofy names for everything; I'm suprised Judy Dench could recite her lines without laughing. "Necromongers"?? Its just so corny. The film's producer picked the wrong screenplay writer, which is the source of the film's problems.<p>Vin Diesel did an excellent job playing Riddick, the conflicted mercenary/killer. The film has alot of good action scenes and Vin does a good job with them. Unlike alot of people, I liked the way the film ended; of course it is a setup for what will be a very interesting sequel. <p>Hopefully, the producers of the next Riddick film will use a different writer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Several years ago, a minor but entertaining science fiction movie called Pitch Black came out.  Essentially a well-made man vs. monster movie, this film was most noted for being a breakthrough movie for Vin Diesel.  In the Chronicles of Riddick, Diesel reprises his first big role with limited effect.<p>In Chronicles, Riddick must contend with the Necromongers, a superpowerful army that goes from planet to planet forcibly converting people to their cause.  They are in search of some mysterious place called the Underverse, which sounds cool, but never really plays a part in the movie.  The leader of the Necromongers - the Lord Marshal -  has heard a prophecy that he could be killed only by a certain race, which not so coincidentally Riddick is one of the last members of.  Before he can even attempt a killing, however, Riddick is detoured to a prison planet where he must rescue a girl who he met in the first movie.<p>Unlike Pitch Black, which was relatively simple in story and special effects, Chronicles is much grander in both story and look.  This is not necessarily a good thing, as there is too much going on to fit into a couple hours; instead of making the movie longer (or making additional movies), too much is crammed into a limited time.  In particularly, the prison planet sequence really doesn't need to be as long as it is since it really is a diversion from the main story.<p>There are other problems.  Although scientific law is often ignored in these sorts of movies, the science in this movie is often implausible:  characters can outrun sunrises and somehow, when it is 700 degrees in the sunlight, you can still survive if you're in the shade.  Internally, there are inconsistencies: for example, the Necromonger brainwashing process is sometimes absolutely effective and other times relatively easy to break out (it depends on what the story demands at any given point).  <p>Diesel does a good enough job in his role as the anti-heroic Riddick.  Judi Dench contributes little in her minor role, but isn't bad.  The remaining characters are also played competently if not spectacularly.  Despite its many problems, this is not an awful movie, and there is enough here to merit a weak three stars.  If you enjoyed Pitch Black, you might like this one as well, but it's best to turn off your brain before going into the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>I've been awaiting this sequel for quite some time.  And you know what?  It was more than well worth the wait!<br />Not only does it flow and have more energy than the last 3 STAR WAR films, but is a fast-paced adventure, chock-full of sci-fi/action and beautiful production scale.<br />I for one was never bored.  From the energized beginning as Riddick is being pursued by mercs on a frozen planet - to his sojourn to a hell world prison planet.<br />If you are looking for an epic feeling and different looking sci-fi film - Chronicles of Riddick delivers!<br />I was expecting just an OK film, but what I got was a film I'd not only see again - but one I can't wait to own on dvd.<br />I WANT ANOTHER SEQUEL!  This made Pitch Black look like a walk in the park...</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>I'm not quite sure whether The Chronicles of Riddick was supposed to be a prequel or a sequel to the fabulous Pitch Black - I think it was a sequel. Whatever the case, this viewer was scratching his head in wonderment at how a promisingly successful science fiction franchise could become such a shapeless, uninteresting mess.<br /><br />Pitch Black was a wonderfully original, imaginative and stylish, with the sexy Vin stealing the show with his slick beefiness and polished athleticism. However, there's nothing subtle or stylish about The Chronicles of Riddick: overblown, and bloated with vast, gaudy special effects, costumes and sets, the movie is pretty much a convoluted headache from beginning to end.<br /><br />The movie begins when Riddick (Diesel) is trying to escape from a cold artic-like planet. There's some kind of bounty placed on his head, but he manages to flee in a slick looking spaceship and ends up on New Mecca finding solace with holy man Imam (Keith David). Enter an embarrassed looking Judi Dench, playing a kind of strange and wispy, translucent wind being, who convinces Riddick that he's the only one who can ultimately destroy the Necromancers, an evil army of half human, vampire-like, ghost beings.<br /><br />Suddenly the Necromongers invade and destroy the planet and try to convert the surviving humans, whom they call "breeders" to their religion, which is worshipping something called the "underverse." Riddick is caught by some bounty hunters and sent to a sun-baked planet called Crematora where he rescues Kyra (Alexa Davalos), and some fellow prisoners.<br /><br />Everything is big, cluttered and noisy in this film, from the crab-like industrialized spaceships that spew some kind of black exhaust, to the spectacular skylines of the alien planets, and the metallic goth-like sets, that are obviously modeled on Ancient Egyptian and roman architecture. But the expensive and exciting effects can't make up for the dreadful script and the absolutely atrocious acting from all involved.<br /><br />Perhaps only Thandie Newton rises above the fray - playing with decided camp - a Lady Macbeth-like villainness intent on obtaining absolute power though her Necromancer boyfriend Vaako (Karl Urban). In one unintentionally funny scene, Thandie seductively tongues Vaako all over the face - it's supposed to be erotic, but comes across as quite revolting.<br /><br />Obviously made for fifteen-year-old boys, The Chronicles of Riddick steers clear of any violence or profanity. Most of the action takes place on the prison planet of Crematoria with Riddick spending the majority of the time in bondage, his sweaty arms stretched out in a Crucifixion-like pose. There's lots of fight scenes, which are so badly edited, overly frenetic, and excessively choreographed that they make your head swim; director David Twohy inexplicably shakes his camera around furiously during every fight, rendering much the action completely unwatchable.<br /><br />As Riddick, Vin looks fabulous, but he can't act, and the lines he is forced to spew belittle the seriousness of the story and ultimately make a mockery of his character. One wonders why the fabulous, iconographic Ms. Dench decided to do this film - rumor has it that Judy and Vin are good friends. If this is the case, lets hope that she can finally steer him the direction of better quality material than this, but judging from his career of late, I very seriously doubt this will be the case. Mike Leonard February 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>My mind hasn't been boggled in a while -> The very first StarWars did me in, and then various parts of The Lord of the Ring years later.  Other than that I'm not one who stares at the screen in awe of special effects.  In fact, the bore me very quickly.  What I likes about the original Riddick film, Pitch Black, was that, outside of the Alien knockoff monsters, there was very little in the way of large scale special effects.  In many ways, it was an intimate thriller rather than a vast drama.<br /><br />So I really wasn't prepared for what appeared on this screen as the film unrolled.  It sneaks up on you as it opens with Riddick's attempted capture by Toombs, a bounty hunter.  The irritated (and very hairy) Riddick sets out to find out who put the bounty on his head and discovers that he is being recruited to stop the conquest of space by the Necromongers.  These latter are truly the knights of total badness.  Their goal is entropy - the total destruction of life and rebirth onto another plane, the Underverse.  The Necromongers, despite a truly heroic culture, are so bad that Vin Diesel comes up smelling like a rose.<br /><br />Why hire Riddick?  The theory is that sometimes you need to fight evil with a different evil.  Riddick is one of the last Furyans, a people who met the Necromongers and lost.  An entire male generation was destroyed right down to infants strangled with their birth cords.  If anyone would want to destroy the Necromongers Riddick should.  Or he would if he cared, and starting out, he doesn't.  But as he walks out the Necromongers arrive.  Diesel gets caught in the combat, captured by Toombs and dumped on a prison planet where he finds Kyra (who was Jack in the first film).<br /><br />When the Necromongers show up again hunting for Riddick, the whole thing falls apart.  Riddick, who has been pretty even tempered for a stone killer, gets really, really mad.  Now it is the hunters who are hunted in a spectacular display of violence, betrayal, and architecture.  Yes, I said architecture.<br /><br />Whoever did the set design and effects for this film (hats off to director David Twohy) simply went insane.  The planetary and prison settings were delightful on their own (imagine being chased across a planet by a sunrise that will burn you to a crisp), but the work on the Necromongers is simply amazing.  They have been designed from the ground up.  Clothes, armor, spaceships, interiors, culture, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />Between the effects and the settings I had to watch the film twice to notice that there really was a plot, albeit a skeletal one.  And half the actors to reasonable jobs with a script of a maximum of 2,000 words.  Purists who demand great art and drama may be dismayed, but this film was downright fun to watch.  A sci-fi barnburner with all the stops pulled out.  If you like fast, furious, and dirty, Riddick is the hero for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Even if I have to apologize to my Friends and Favorites, and my family, I have to admit that I really liked this movie.  It's a Sci-Fi movie with a "Mad Maxx" appeal that, while changing many things, left Riddick from `Pitch Black' to be just Riddick.  They did not change his attitude or soften him up or bring him out of his original character, which was very pleasing to `Pitch Black' fans like myself.<br /><br />First off, let me say that when playing the DVD, the first selection to come up is Convert or Fight, and no explanation of the choices.  This confused me at first, so I will mention off the bat that they are simply different menu formats, that each menu has the very same options, simply different background visuals.  Select either one and continue with the movie.<br /><br />Chronicles Of Riddick takes place after Riddick's escape from the planet of monsters on Pitch Black, starting out with his recapture after being in hiding for many years.  Now we are going to get a glimpse of just what is going on in the universe during the futuristic time frame of `Pitch Black'.<br /><br />A large sect of religious fanatics called Necromongers are moving from planet to planet, converting others to their faith and killing those who will not convert.  Necromongers are half-dead beings from many different original planets, kind of like Star Trek's Borgs except they do not loose their individuality when they are converted.  Some are made into "Lensors", very cool effect of once-humans with these round blue shields over their faces, under which their faces look a little skeletal and decomposed.<br /><br />Riddick gets caught up with the Necromongers after he is taken to the prison planet of Crematoria, where daylight, rather than nightfall, is the killer.  Here he finds a grown up Jack (the girl from Pitch Black), now using her real name of Kyra.  The girl Jack was a strong addition to Pitch Black, the adult Kyra is rather whiney and annoying, and my one complaint would be that they should have done better with Jack's development.  He has to escape Crematoria and help Jack off the planet also.<br /><br />Truthfully, the entire plot is Riddick running from people who want to capture him, but it's still a good movie made interesting with the addition of the half-dead race.  The Lady Vaako of the Necromongers is a very `Cleopatra' type of character, with her own Marc Anthony in the form of Vaako, one of the Lord Marshal's fiercest warriors.<br /><br />In some of the scenes the Necromongers almost come across like Televangelists, wanting converts so badly, and desiring entire populations to kneel before them.  Just a funny comparison to mull over while you watch.  There is also an Elemental in the movie, a race of beings who can phase in and out of dimensions, whose job it seems to be not to inform the Necromongers but to distract them from Riddick, at least that is the feeling that I got.<br /><br />The special effects of this movie make up for the slower parts about three quarters of the way through the movie, stunning visuals of cities that are half gothic and half futuristic, great flight scenes (including a cool shot of the underbelly of one of the ships), the sunrise over the planet Crematoria is spectacular (but not quite as good as the nightfall effect in Pitch Black), the power going out all over the city, the half metal-half squishy mind readers, and that is barely skimming the effects.<br /><br />The costume and set designs are visually stunning, well made without going too far over the top, and the editing is not as choppy as David Twohy warns us about at the beginning of the Director's Cut.<br /><br />My one other problem is that with a loss of midrange hearing, I had to use the English Subtitles to hear some of the conversations, so if you are slightly hard of hearing you will want to use that feature.  The battles are rapid and a bit confusing during the use of strobe lighting, but that is what the slow-mo button is for. ;-)<br /><br />All in all, this is a pleasing sci-fi adventure movie, not to be confused with a work of art or a lesson in any socially redeeming values.  It is good old-fashioned fun and a relief to us sci-fi fans who tire of critics blathering on about how sci-fi and fantasy are not worthy forms of entertainment.  These are the same critics who thought The English Patient was a good movie. (gag)<br /><br />As the Necromongers say, "Humans are an unguided mistake."<br /><br />Enjoy the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Riddick is the continuing story of Riddick (Vin Diesel), the bald-headed, night seeing convict who escaped from prison and was ultimately so tough that he could beat up aliens with just a knife. Given that the first movie was called Pitch Black, Riddick's peculiar eyes lent him a particular advantage - both against his captors and the aliens that inhabited the planet.<p>On the surface, one could summarize Pitch Black as an Aliens knockoff. But it was so much more than that. Just as Aliens was more than about soldiers blowing up aliens, Pitch Black was about how people hide behind who they really are and that people don't change - they just reveal their true natures. The movie was also noteworthy for being a science fiction film that portrayed Muslim beliefs in a positive light and as the dominant religion.<p>Keeping those elements in mind, the Chronicles of Riddick (TCOR) is the logical extension of the first movie, even though it doesn't involve many aliens or all that much darkness. No, TCOR stays true to its characters and appeals to what made the first movie so much fun - Riddick's bad, sure...but the bad guys are even WORSE.<p>Those bad guys are the Necromongers, a race bent on the total conversion of the universe to the "Underverse" - sort of an anti-Mecca. The Necromongers aren't just bad guys; they're an entire style. Statues abound of torture and self-mutilation. The Necromonger ships have faces built into their hulls of the uncaring tyrant known only as Lord Marshal. Everything, from the staves the captains wield to the weapons of mass destruction the Necromongers use to obliterate planets - it all fits. The Necromonger ships even hum along on roiling clouds of black energy.<p>The troops match the architecture. Their helmets model the pain and suffering they believe in. Undead watchdogs, their faces encased in strange helmets, "lens" out the living, seeing through darkness and right through walls. Those who are caught are converted to "half-dead," uncaring soldiers in service to Lord Marshal. The most powerful Necromongers can steal a person's soul right out of their bodies.<p>In short, the Necromongers are really cool bad guys.<p>If the Necromongers seem familiar to some, it's because they're modeled after the concept of a negative energy universe that so many Dungeons & Dragons players are familiar with. Vin Diesel is a self-professed gamer and his roots show - heck, Judi Dench plays an "air elemental." Nobody uses an air elemental in a sci-fi context these days unless they're a gamer.<p>Unfortunately, this assumption may lose those who aren't sci-fi fans, gamers, or fantasy fans. Indeed, many of the criticisms of the movie is that it's too confusing. My parents (who admittedly, raised me to be the gaming freak that I am) understood the plot just fine, and they are not gamers.<p>If the plot were merely about the Necromonger's quest to take over the universe, it would make for a rather feeble rip off of the Borg from Star Trek. Instead, Riddick is prophesized to kill the Lord Marshal, and as a result his second in command (played by Karl Urban, of Eomer fame from Lord of the Rings) along with his scheming wife plot to bring about the conflict.<p>Why? Because the Necromonger way of life (er, death?) is "You Keep What You Kill." In other words, whoever kills the Lord Marshal gets to take over the entire legion of Necromongers.<p>Of course, Riddick wants nothing to do with his fate as one of the last members of a race known as the "Furions." The Furions have been all but wiped out by the Necromongers. But Lord Marshal is to be killed by his own knife by Riddick...so bounty hunters are once again on his trail.<p>Being on the lam is not a good way to raise a kid. Riddick has long since left the Imam on New Mecca and Jack (the kid from Pitch Black) to her own devices. When the Necromongers finally back Riddick into a corner, he discovers there's no escaping the bad guys...or his past.<p>TCOR is filled with a lot of important relationships, commentary about the nature of evil, snide swipes at religious institutions, free thought, and morality. It also has plenty of action. Instead of running across a pitch-black planet, Riddick must traverse a burning planet aptly named Crematoria.<p>With the majesty of the Necromongers and the amount of planet hopping that takes place, digital effects are rife throughout the movie. These are expected - indeed, the movie would be unwatchable without the effects, some of which are integral to the plot. The most subtle effect is Riddick's eyes, that shine like silver plates in the darkness.<p>Critics of the film have pointed out that Lord Marshal does not appear to be a physical match for Riddick. That's kind of like saying "The Emperor doesn't seem like he can take Luke Skywalker in a duel." The physical presence of Lord Marshal is not the point. He is the only one to have touched the Underverse and upon doing so acquired incredible power. He SHOULD look like a "normal guy."<p>The Chronicles of Riddick is a good old-fashioned science fiction ride across the universe in the tradition of Conan (especially the ending). The movie will only seem confusing to people who are not familiar with gaming and fantasy tropes...and thus critics and boring people SHOULD NOT SEE IT.<p>But for the rest of us...watch it, then watch Pitch Black again. They make an excellent pair.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>I think this movie has gotten a bad rap by most reviewers. Maybe they are expecting too much or maybe they just don't understand what's being done here. Chronicles of Riddick (CoR) is an entertaining movie with just little bit of subtle sophistication and even a misunderstood pedigree. It's essentially an action/adventure kind of science fiction that doesn't go too terribly deep, but deep enough to get the story across and end up being an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />I don't know if this was where the director was going, but I saw a lot of elements you would see in one of those classic 50's space operas. If you have seen any of the classic Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon serials you might get what I'm saying. The movie gives you the impression of being on a grand scale without actually being on that level. The plot itself is rather simplistic and that's why it works. The beauty is in the subtle complexities most probably won't even notice. The side plots in this movie don't seem to fit right, but by the end they show as being essential.<br /><br />On a less glamorous note certain things that lend themselves to that 50's matinee style of Sci-Fi do seem cheesy like how stuff is named. You have villains called Necromongers. You have planets with names like Crematoria and races with names like Furyans. Names like that kinda kill the whole Riddick coolness. Riddick himself, on the other hand, is still the ultimate coolness he was in Pitch Black. I have to hand it Vin Diesel. He definitely has this character down. While Pitch Black did a decent job giving this anti-hero some development this movie further expands on it. You get a little more into his motivations and drives in this movie, which are mostly personal. I do believe this is the best anti-hero character I have seen in science fiction.<br /><br />The action on this movie is sweet, but in the first few scenes it does go by VERY fast. After a while the action settles to a better pace, which will delight the bruisers in the crowd. The imagery is definitely worth watching and the set design is awesome. There is this medieval style to the Necromongers that give it both a familiar and unfamiliar vibe to them. Locations like Crematoria (I hate that name) are both fascinating concepts and nice looking design-wise. You get to see a lot of different types of special effects here and generally they look very solid. The computer-generated effects aren't in any way top notch, though they are several degrees better than movies like Van Helsing.<br /><br />They have released a theatrical cut and an "unrated" director's cut. Supposedly some of the content that would have given the movie an R rating was put in the director's cut, but to be honest I didn't see anything that would have changed the rating in my eyes. I guess the MPAA are very picky about some things. What are the differences? Well for one there are about 14 more minutes added to the movie. Some of it just little details. Some of it totally new content that changes some scenes (and the storyline) completely. Some of it useless. The biggest and best change is the addition of a sort of Furyan destiny laid out in front of Riddick. Not awesome, but it is interesting.<br /><br />The sad thing is some good stuff that was in the theatrical version is lost. One in particular is the big Necromonger (sigh...) fight scene in Crematoria (ugh...). The theatrical version was a shorter and apparently the sound editing would have been horrible if cut with the same audio. The result was a music only scene that I call the "ballet of death" that to me carried a higher sensory impact that the uncut, full audio, fight. I suppose less is more for me. Another cut I would have liked to see stay was Riddick's "back of the bus" monologue, which was replaced by a completely useless (although sexually suggestive) scene with one of the mercs.<br /><br />Previous releases of this movie only gave you one option in regards to which version of the movie you wanted to see, including the HD-DVD release. This Blu-Ray release gives you both versions of the movie. That in of itself is a big bonus for a guy like me who sees good stuff from both versions. The good times don't stop there. The video is a VC-1 codec taken directly from the digital master (same as the HD-DVD release). I'm not going to say it's the absolute best transfer out there, but it is really nice and definitely is head and tails above any Riddick DVD release. The audio, on the other hand, gets the full praise with DTS-HD 5.1 lossless surround sound. Not even the HD-DVD had that. You also get DTS 5.1 surround in French and Spanish (subtitles in all three languages).<br /><br />The extras are a mix of content that was available in the DVDs and HD-DVD along with a little more (I did say this was the best release to date, didn't I?). Here's the breakdown (all in 480p standard definition):<br /><br />Intro by David Twohy - Just an explanation of the transfer of the Director's cut. It almost sounds like an apology to those who may notice the cuts in editing. Same intro as in the Extended Cut DVD and HD-DVD.<br /><br />Director's Commentary - Actually pretty informative as David doesn't seem to shy away from share all the details in making the film. Same commentary from DVD and HD-DVD (essentially the previous releases).<br /><br />Virtual Guide to Chronicles of Riddick - A few entries on the Riddick universe as told by the characters in the movie. Same feature from previous releases.<br /><br />Toombs Chase Log - A personal log chronicling Toombs' hunting of Riddick up until the start of the movie as told by Tombs himself. Same featurette from the previous releases.<br /><br />Visual Effects Revealed - A short featurette on the special effects of the movie. I believe this is brand new, but it's pretty brief (about six minutes) so not much of a new bonus.<br /><br />Creation of New Mecca - A look at the various set pieces from the movie. Same as the HD-DVD and it seems this featurette replaces Riddick's Worlds from the DVD. Alas... no more 360 degree views of the more impressive sets.<br /><br />Vin Diesel's Guided Tour - Vin walks you around the sets showing you behind the scenes work on the movie. Same as in the previous releases.<br /><br />Riddick Rises - A discussion of the Riddick character by Director David Twohy and Vin Diesel. The two people who effectively created the character give more background info on our favorite anti-hero.<br /><br />Keep What You Kill - Very cool analysis of the Necromongers and their culture as well as film details like costumes and props and such. Same featurette as in the HD-DVD.<br /><br />Complete Chronicles - A U-Control feature with picture in picture narrative of Riddick. Includes both video footage and text trivia. This is aBlu-Ray exclusive.<br /><br />Chronicles Compendium - Another Blu-Ray exclusive that is also a U-Control picture in picture feature that delves into pretty much all the other things in the Riddick universe that Complete Chronicles doesn't cover. In the same format as Complete Chronicles as well.<br /><br />Anatomy of a Fight - Yet another U-Control feature exclusive to Blu-Ray. This one focuses on Riddick's combat strategies and methods.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - Same as all previous releases. Some are alternate scenes. Some would have been nice to have added to the Director's Cut. Some definitely best left off the movie. Commentary by Twohy also available.<br /><br />BDLive enabled - Of course this is a Blu-Ray exclusive. If you want to share Riddick comments and stuff that's what BDLive is all about.<br /><br />Chronicles of Riddick is a good solid story with the look of an epic film but with the sensibilities of a good old 50's Sci-Fi adventure. If you are into action then you should be happy with this movie. This current release by far offers the most from any previous release with both versions of the movie, lossless audio, and a few extra features not previously available. If you have a Blu-Ray player this is the version to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>In 2000, writer/director David Twohy introduced the world to his dark hero character named Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) in the sci-fi/film noir film entitled "Pitch Black".  Four years later, he wrote/directed the sequel that was entitled "The Chronicles of Riddick".  In this action-packed film noir sequel, Riddick, after having been on the run for five years, has been captured by a group of bounty hunters lead by a man named Toombs (Nick Chinlund).  While en route to the planet Helion Prime (where the bounty on Riddick was initiated), Riddick escapes and takes over Toombs ship.  He lands on Helion Prime and goes in search for Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David, a returning character/actor from "Pitch Black").  Unfortunately, Helion Prime has also become the latest target of conquest for a group called the Necromongers that are essentially the living-dead (not vampires though).  The Necromonger attack fleet wreaks havoc upon the population of Helion Prime, whose survivors are then given the "opportunity" to become Necromongers themselves by their leader known only as Lord Marshal (Colm Feore).  Many refuse this "offer", including Riddick who is also present.  Riddick is taken by the Necromongers for further questioning at the request of a woman named Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton), who is the wife to a leading Necromonger general named Vaako (Karl Urban).  Using Necromongers conditioned to be powerful mind-readers, the Necromongers quickly discover that Riddick is a Furian, which is a race that Lord Marshal fears most.  Though Riddick is able to escape from the Necromongers, he is again captured by Toombs and his latest crew who decide to take him to an extremely inhospitable penal planet called Crematoria.  It is there that Riddick comes across the prisoner Kyra (Alexa Davalos), but Lord Marshal is determined to recapture Riddick, so he sends Vaako and a group of Necromonger soldiers in pursuit from Helion Prime.<br /><br />With a combination of elaborate sets, CGI special effects, dark cinematography and good costuming, "The Chronicles of Riddick" is visually very entertaining.  The plot is interesting and the dialog is fair; but the editing was not as good as it could have been. Overall, though, it's an entertaining and interesting film that I rate with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other notable characters include the elemental human Aereon (Judi Dench), the Necromonger Purifier (Linus Roache), The Guv of the Crematoria prison (Yorick van Wageningen), Lajjun (Kimberly Hawthorne), Ziza (Alexis Llewellyn) and Eve Logan (Christina Cox).</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE UNRATED WIDESCREEN EDITION<br /><br />I won't spend much time on reviewing the movie itself as there are plenty here for you check out. I will do a review on the "director's cut" version and the DVD itself. In a nutshell COR is a combination of action sci-fi and classic serial science fiction (or "Comic Book" sci-fi if you prefer). In other words lots of cool action, fantastic sets, nice special effects, and decent plot development is on one side. On the other side you get cheesy names for locales and peoples (Crematoria, Hellion, The Elementals, The Necromongers), a few 2-dimensional characters, and a somewhat condensed story. This kind of content would do well in a longer run time (in spite of that being taboo in Hollywood). While it is a completely different kind of movie than the previous one, for those who loved Riddick in Pitch Black you will love him here too.<br /><br />Now for the special edition. To those of you who watched the theatrical version and complained about holes in the story a lot of them get filled in this edition. With 15 minutes of new footage lots of little loose ends get tied up and a new character is introduced. The new slant might seem a bit on the mystical side for some tastes, but I felt it appropriate. There are more than a few little things added to scenes to help flesh out development and I'm glad they did that.<br /><br />Probably the biggest change was the big fight scene at Crematoria. It now has more of it and the scene now has full audio sounds of guns blazing and bodies busted instead of just music like on the theatrical release. As much as I enjoy the additional footage I kinda liked the silence of the theatrical release better. What with just music playing and seeing all that mayhem it felt more dramatic and even artsy (in a "Ballet of Death" sort of way).<br /><br />They took out the "Back of the Bus" dialog in one scene, which i miss. Seems like they replaced it with a "sexy" scene that to me is a total waste of film. Don't ask me why they decided to put such a useless scene in (if you watch you'll know what I'm talking about). At least this is the only added footage that I recall that would have been better off in the deleted scenes section.<br /><br />While I won't say they fixed everything and now COR is the movie it should have been I do have to admit it felt much better watching the Unrated Edition as opposed to the Theatrical one. That might just be that I picked up more the third time around (yes I saw it twice in the theater), but then again maybe the new cut is just plain better. As for the "unrated" rating it's no big deal. More violence but still little to no blood and gore. Maybe a little more bad language, but it didn't seem like it. I guess it could be an R movie now, but it's a light R. If I was the one running the MPAA I would still call this a PG-13 movie.<br /><br />Quality-wise Twohy makes a comment on the introduction about how you might see noticeable fluctuations where they made the cuts for the new footage, but I didn't notice any. However I didn't see it on HDTV so maybe as you get to better quality TV's and bigger screen tv's you might notice it. DVD looks great and visually crisp with the audio being just as clear.<br /><br />The extras are pretty good, but I've seen better. Here's a breakdown:<br /><br />Audio Commentary - It's informative but not nearly as much as I had hoped. There is a fair amount of the crew just shooting the breeze comparitively speaking. No Vin commentary, which I would have liked to have heard since he apparently put a LOT of creative effort into this movie.<br /><br />Two menus - The exact same menu but with different art and stuff. An interesting diversion, but not a dealmaker.<br /><br />Toombs Log - Interesting, but doesn't really give you that much insight. As a primer for the movie don't bother, but as a little character development on Toombs' side it works well enough.<br /><br />Worlds or Riddick - The 360 degree view of some of the sets is not bad. The sets are pretty neat and it's nice to know they didn't go all CG like George Lucas and actually built some wonderful sets. Extra feature-wise? Again I say... I've seen better. The tiny featurette with Vin Diesel was the most informative and entertaining of this set. That little snippet should have been longer.<br /><br />Documentary - A pretty good documentary for its size. Definitely the most worthwhile extra on here. Again it would be nice if they made it longer.<br /><br />Deleted scenes - Some of these scenes are not only cool, but I feel would have really given more depth to the movie. Those few scenes I wish had stayed, but most are approprately taken out for whatever reason. Still as far as deleted scenes go most of them are pretty nice with only one lame duck scene that never should have gotten past the script that I recall.<br /><br />Virtual Guide - Practically useless if you are looking get more insight into the Riddick universe. Doesn't really tell you anything more than what you would find out in the movie anyway.<br /><br />Facts on Demand Viewing - Haven't tried it yet, but it sounds interesting. Will update when I learn more.<br /><br />Riddick X-Box game - Useless if you don't have an X-Box. No trailers or other teasers for non-X'ers to see.<br /><br />All in all if you liked Riddick in the theater you definitely should be getting this version. Forget the theatrical cut. There is more to love here. If you never seen Chronicles of Riddick and are a sci-fi fan of any kind I recommend renting this. If you like what you see you can always buy it later. Better yet go to one of those used DVD stores that apply credit from rental towards a purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Vin Diesel, playing futuristic fugitive Riddick, grunts and growls his way through "The Chronicles of Riddick" in a manner reminiscent of Schwarzenegger in The Terminator.  Don't get your hopes up, "Riddick" lacks the impact of seminal cultish Arnie flick.<p>While method acting isn't Diesel's forte, his beefcaked psychique provides a worthy macho image for this role.  The plot which was poorly developed doesn't really define the flick as it is more a vehicle for computer generated special effects.  Some action sequences move so fast as to appear blurry which didn't enhance my viewing pleasure.<p>It seems that Riddick is a survivor of a thought to be exterminated race called the Furians.  The supreme power in the universe is a sect called the Necromongers.  Their mission seems to be the conquest of all civilizations in order to seek their nirvana called Underverse(?).  The powerful Lord Marshal leader of the Necros played by Colm Feore has been foretold that he will be destroyed by a Furian.  His mission becomes clear.......... destroy Riddick.<p>This movie was essentially nothing more than violent eye candy.  The accomplished Dame Judi Dench was a strange sight to see among the cast in a film of this type.  "Riddick" fails to live up to the mail biting drama established so wonderfully in the prequel "Pitch Black".</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>it's hard for a sequal to get anywhere near as good as the first one, or in some cases surpass it as well. well this one almost did for me. pitch black and the chronicles of riddick are both so different, but are still along the same lines. the chronicles was very good, i didn't think it was going to be such a big deal, but i'm glad i was wrong. vin diesel, does what he does best. the big action hero, with an "i don't care about anybody but myself" attitude returns for some more. he's a great actor, and these are the kinds of movies he should do, because all eyes are on him the whole time. the follow up story was good as well. a few years later he's back and only he can save the world. he meets up with an old friend, and together they must beat this leader of the half dead necromongers. he finds love, but at what a cost. in the end good must prevail over evil. great movie, fantastic scenes, and riddick does it again. i want more.</p></br><a href="../users/A34XPZS5DXA6HA.html">A34XPZS5DXA6HA</a><br/><p>For anyone who has seen Pitch Black this will truly be a treat, but you won't have to have seen Pitch Black to enjoy this film.  This is a fantastically written story.  The effects are awesome, the cast is one of the best I have seen, and the costumes and set are amazing.  All of the above melds together so well you will have trouble remembering that this is something completly imaginary at times.  I enjoyed this flick throughly and feel it is a must have in my movie collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>Lets face it ... Vin Diesel is not much of an actor ... while I think he is attractive to look at, I don't expect much from him other than a good action flick.  That being said, this movie was interesting.  The set and costume designs were beautiful, grand and vast.  The story line was interesting; and the acting was ok.  Better than I expected.  This is worth being in your collection and if other "chronicles" will be brought to the big screen, all the better to start your collection off right!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Going for a vastly more grand scale than either "Pitch Black" or "Dark Fury". "Chronicles Of Riddick" hinges the fate of the universe on resisting the advances of a huge militaristic/twisted religious sect called the Necromongers who are overrunning entire planets, with a survivor from the first film, now politically influential, attempting to recruit Riddick to help with the battle.  Some have complained of a relative lack of story here; Ill take the opposite track and submit that there's a LOT of story, it just gets swamped by the constant rocket-fast pace.  I mean, what we have here is a story that should have been about 4-and-a-half hours, but running somewhere around two hours (and to think that the theatrical movie was actually 16 minutes shorter than the DVD!) it's got more angles packed in more tightly than "Star Wars Episode 1", to the point where the story actually does get in danger of disappearing from sight.  This is one you're really going to have to pay attention to in order to make sense of.  It's packed with some of the best and most dynamic action scenes ever (although sometimes of tenuous believability), but if the characters and multiple plotlines had been given proper screentime to develop, not only would they themselves have added to the movie but the action scenes themselves would have been more potent.  The tenuous believability is also a hampering effect at times.  Occasionally the movie straddles (thankfully briefly) the line of camp, which was definately Not the case with the first two.  It's like it's so big it just got away from the filmmakers a couple of times there.<br /><br />  This isn't a bad movie by any means though, it's just not as great as it should have been.  If giving it three stars seems like it's a putdown it's not; when stuck between giving a movie 3 or 4 stars I think what I'd give it on a tenpoint scale (an extremely inexact science, because I think movies are hard to quantify with a numerical value) and this is a good 6.5 to 7.  Some reviewers I've noticed (not a criticism, just an observation) will say a movie is pretty terrible and then still give it 3 or even 4 stars; I guess it all depends on how good you think an 'average' movie is what would be signified by each rating.  In my view, based on everything I've seen in my life from the worst to the best, the 'average' movie (2.5 stars or 5 Of 10) is still pretty watchable, and I place "Chronicles Of Riddick" well above average. It's just not as great as it could have been, or as great as "Pitch Black" or "Dark Fury".<br /><br />  I hope there's a sequel (before this came out I think I heard some where they wanted to do Three more after this) because, without giving anything away, it's wide open for sequelization, (having had a terrific twist ending that opens u a universe of possibilities) and could build on the strengths of all the films so far, including this one, and sidestep the slips in this one, perhaps with a longer running time.  If it's not financially feasible to do another mega-budget live-action one like this there are a number of less expensive routes they could take: original novels; animated features (actually I want more Dark Fury-type animated entries regardless); comic books; etc.  The series is too good to end on a slightly off-kilter note.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>well, i got a copy today because of all of you reviewers here at amazon, and you aroused my curiosity! i had no intention of renting or buying it, but i am sure glad i did! never saw "pitch black" but almost ordered it after watching TCOR! i probably will not order it after all, but TCOR was incredibly entertaining, visually stunning, the sound was crisp, clear, and room shaking at times! in short i had a really good viewing experience this evening, and plan to watch this unrated version again tomorrow! vin is himself, so cool, so tough, dame judy dench adds such a touch of class to the film as does colm feore as lord marshall. thandie newton is as beautiful as she has ever been too. all in all, a great fun ride that gripped me for just over 2 hours.  don't miss it-thanks co reviewers here at amazon. forget you, pro critics who practically hated this film. ps: beloved bill clinton saw it with chelsea and he really enjoyed it alot-bill, if it's good enough for you, it sure was better than good enough for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>When I first walked away from this movie, I thought: "that was pretty cool, much better than Pitch Black" but nothing of greatness. But I began to daydream about the story and proceeded to watch it another 3 times in the following days. The more I think about it, the more I can appreciate this movie as a Gem.<br /><br />Of course it does lack in certain areas (it's a "VinDiesel flick" after all), but it's an extremely ambitious story, and I give them a 9 for the effort. They went all-out with the Production Value and the story is an absolute masterpiece. The  Baroque imagery of these crusading death zealots, the realism of the sci-fi, the visuals of New Mecca, and Vin is actually not-bad as the anti-hero. There are so many great things about this movie. My only complaint is that the history behind the Necromongers is too brushed-over in the movie. The Special Features explain alot about their interesting evolution and mission.<br /><br />Totally worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>15 extra minutes doesn't sound like much, but it really improved this film.  I think the theatrical version didn't do as well because it took a character people were familiar with (from Pitch Black) and expanded it to the nth degree without any background explanation!  What makes a "Furian" so special? Where the heck did Necromongers come from! These 15 minutes go a long way to fleshing it out (not to mention the deleted scene with Aereon that should've gone in the director's cut). A new character is included in the footage that gives insight to the Furians and the extras provide a deeper mythos for the Riddick world, making you beg for a sequel.<br /><br />Critics panned Diesel's performance, but really, was Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in the Terminator any better?  No.  Diesel acts as well as any other "action" star--see this movie for the action and adrenaline, not an oscar performance. Buy it!<br /><br />One thing: the movie begins with an introduction by the director explaining that when new/expanded scenes appear there will be some disruption to the scene.  I never noticed anything of the sort.  The movie flowed seemlessly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much from all the bad reviews but I really enjoyed this movie. I liked it even more than Pitch Black surprisingly. Riddick is Vin Diesel's best character period. He's super cool and  deadly and Diesel plays him extremely well. The villains are weak with this silly name. They look like a rip-off of something from Stargate.<br /><br />  I don't know why Judi Denches performance gets knocked though. She's a lot better than a lot of the other supporting actors. Colm Feore (Storm of the Century) as the head villain is a lot worse. Thandie Newton (Mission Impossible 2), is bad too as this sneaky 2 faced women who is conspiring against him. Alexa Davalos isn't bad though as the Jack character from the first one all grown-up. Her character wanted to be like Riddick in Pitch Black and now her fighting skills a lot like his and she's pretty deadly herself. Anyway this movie is a lot of fun and always entertaining due to Diesel's performance. Script wise though, the Riddick video game even has a better story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Vin Diesal has made some pretty good movies (Boiler Room, The Fast and the Furious, XXX).  This unfortunately, is not one of his better acting efforts.  The story has a lot of action though and some of the fight scenes are good.  Diesal's character is has a smug attitude that sometimes makes it difficult to root for him.  He does have an intimidating pressence that makes the bad guys miss, or perhaps they are all just bad shots.<br /><br />The special effects are not high tech but they seem good for what they are.  There is some narration at the beginning that is important not to miss because, without it, you will have a hard time following the story.  Overall I would give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>i loved this movie. i liked pitch black allot but i never thought this would be better. it was awesome and i would have paid to see it but i had the free ticket that came with my pitch black DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Vin Diesel returns as the character Riddick introduced in the earlier sci-fi film "Pitch Black". The film is grand in terms of concept and special effects, but its script and direction is less than stellar.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Riddick's character is one-dimensional: there's no change or revelation in his character which is the basis for solving any sort of mystery or riddle. This is the typical theme structure of an epic narrative/movie. The film's epic status attempts are evident in the plot structure. Our hero is an outcast or in the shadows; people come to him as their last hope to save the world; he has to face an unknown threat alone; he overcomes the threat because of some revelation/transformation and becomes a changed man. The film's plot fails to carry such a theme because Riddick doesn't change as a character and doesn't really seem to be challenged too much. The film actually follows more a comic-book structure where the protagonist is simply an out-of-the-box perfect superhero who goes into a grand finale with an arch-villain and wins.<br /><br />In short, the film has an interesting story line and great special effects but fails to live up to its potential. The plot is weak and supports only an incomplete theme that's based on a one-dimensional character.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>This movie is set supposedly five years after Pitch Black.  Now, the wanted criminal Riddick (Diesel) arrives on a planet called New Mecca, and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers, an army that plans to convert or kill all humans in the universe.<br /><br />All in all, this is a drab, dull effort that basically has only a couple of redeeming features; one of them, of course, is Diesel.  Without Vin Diesel, this would have been a colossal mess. Apart from that, the only other credit are the special effects and the slightly average fight scenes. But apart from that, it's well, downhill. Overall, a silly plot and some watered-down dialogue drag this film down and put a worse name of Pitch Black that was a good sci-fi thriller. The Chronicles of Riddick had potential. None of it shows.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Schwarzenegger wanna-be Vin Diesel reprises his role as Richard Riddick; the character whom he played in Pitch Black which actually wasn't too bad.  The Chronicles of Riddick however, find Diesel and writer/director David Twohy in the center of a glorified B-movie with A plus special effects, and the character development of Diesel's Riddick, which really attempted to go somewhere in Pitch Black, gets thrown out the window here.  Riddick finds himself with a massive bounty on his head, and he is also thrown into a full scale war with a fascist master race bent on, what else, domination of the universe.  Colm Feore provides an antagonistical villain, while Lord of the Rings' Karl Urban is given a meaty role, and Thandie Newton and Judi Dench are wasted in their roles.  The CGI effects are spectacular, but Diesel proves to be the biggest special effect of them all; flexing his way towards a forseeable conclusion that leaves the door open for another "Chronicle".  This is the franchise that Diesel chose over his profitable XXX film, and even though I don't expect much from anything with Vin Diesel as the main attraction, I did expect something more from David Twohy.  If you want mindless action and CGI, check this out, but if you wan't a movie with brains you should avoid this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Chronicles Of Riddick" is a great movie! It has excellent special effects and a beautiful production and costume design. This movie is the sequel to "Pitch Black" (2000) Vin Diesel (who also produced the film) is back as Richard B. Riddick, the escaped convict and murderer who escaped off the planet safely from the aliens in "Pitch Black" (2000). David Twohy, who directed and co-wrote "Pitch Black" (2000) is back as well, this time, it is just his name on the screenplay and story. Keith David is back as well, too, as Imam, who escaped off the planet safely from the aliens with Riddick, as well. Alexa Davalos plays a character from the original whose name is different than it was in the original. She plays Jack, whose name is now Kyra, who also escaped off the planet safely from the aliens with Riddick and Imam. The composer, who did the music from "Pitch Black", Graeme Revell, is back as well, composing a intriguing score in this movie. This movie is as great as its original "Pitch Black". It's fresh and it is a well-designed film. This well-rounded cast also includes Colm Feore as Lord Marshal, Thandie Newton as Dame Vaako, Judi Dench as Aereon, and Karl Urban as Vaako. The cinematography by Hugh Johnson, who did the cinematography to the Ridley Scott films, "White Squall" (1996) and "G.I. Jane" (1997), is excellent. The casting by Anne McCarthy (who was one of the casting directors for "Pitch Black" (2000) & Mary Selway is excellent. The film editing by Tracy Adams, Martin Hunter, & Dennis Virkler is excellent. The production design by Holger Gross and costume design by Michael Dennison & Ellen Mirojnick is excellent and beautiful-looking. As is the art direction by Kevin Ishioka, Mark W. Mansbridge, & Sandi Tanaka & set decoration by Peter Lando. The visual effects by Rhythm & Hues, CIS Hollywood, Industrial Light & Magic, The Farm West, Double Negative, Cobalt F/X, Hammerhead Productions, is beautifully excellent. The stunts are excellent and well done. This movie was well made and well designed, visually. Go see this movie if you want to. Go see it before "Spider-Man 2" (2004) comes out into theaters Wednesday, June 30, if you want to.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Vin Diesel is back as Riddick, savior of the universe, in this titanic sci-fi blowout! He's not just up against hordes of  flesh-stripping monsters this time around. Nope, this time he's stumbled into the middle of a galactic takeover. Riddick must somehow face the Necromongers, an army of planet-killing warriors, bent on converting all to their insane religion or simply wiping out those who dare to resist. Riddick appears to be up against an unstoppable force here! Fortunately, he's also got a destiny that even he knows nothing about. Riddick is here for a reason. His very purpose is tied to this overwhelming army of zealots! The Necromongers have messed with the wrong guy! THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK is big, loud, and very entertaining.

I mean just to see Diesel and the great Judy Dench in the same sceen is worth the DVD purchase.  This movie is very well done, the special effects are first rate and the story is fascinating.  I had not seen Pitch Black so i was a bit lost at first, but the movie gets you up to speed quickly.  I didnt go into this movie expecting much, so i was shocked at how well i liked it.  The DVD extras are good, they explain some of the back ground on the characters and locations, which i appreciated, because the movie moves fast.

I did not feel any real interest in it, no connection!<br /><br />I felt like my eyes were gliding over pictures on the screen, and not much was absorbed, my eyes weren't hungry for this movie at all.<br /><br />The main character is a cool guy, and he kicks ass nicely, but other than that, I felt like I lost over 2 hours of my life on this CG movie.<br /><br />Most of the background was done on the computer, and it had a cheap feeling/look to it.<br /><br />One thing I liked was the costumes, the Necromongers had this great medieval/meets new age warrior stuff on, and it certainly saved this from being a totally horrible experience.<br /><br />Really, the simple fact of writing a review of this is putting me to sleep. It's a bit of a dozer.....</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>While I fall short of championing "The Chronicles of Riddick", I didn't find it as bad as most critics did when it was released. The theatrical release, most likely at studio insistence, was handed a PG-13 rating. The DVD version is the director's cut, which runs 15 minutes longer and would undoubtedly have gave been given an R rating. [It's unrated.] Perhaps this more violent version is also more cohesive.<br /><br />I don't condone violence. I'm of those wimps who believes in some sort of gun control and who was against the invasion of Iraq. But I know ours is a society that has always condoned - and, in many ways - lionized violence.<br /><br />The movies have always reflected our values. Gangsters - and, later, the Mafioso - were enshrined as cultural icons. Westerns gleefully depicted the near genocide of Native Americans. Cartoon shorts, which I love, are quite violent. [Bugs vs. Elmer, The Road Runner vs. The Coyote, Daffy Duck vs. anyone who crosses his path, etc.]<br /><br />This movie is violent, but the killing is more in synch with today's video games than it is with the real world. [Again, Hollywood's reflecting today's culture.]<br /><br />The story is nonsensical, but is no dumber than the plots of either of the two modern "Mummy" movies or of "Starship Troopers". If anything, the movie is far more sumptuous visually than any of those movies. The screenwriters may have been asleep at the wheel, but the digital special effect people were not.<br /><br />The main reason for the failure of "The Chronicles of Riddick", both with critics and with the public, may be the Hollywood publicity machine. The machine is now totally corporate. Said machine has been intent on making Vin Diesel an action star a la Arnold Schwazenegger or Stallone. What the machine does not understand is that, while Diesel may be a true action star, he is being propelled by a machine, rather than by a series of wise career choices.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>I bought The Chronicles of Riddick on DVD for my brother for Christmas, but due to a mix-up he already had it, and I never achieved a chance to return it upon my return from Canada. So, I finally pulled it out and watched it yesterday evening. Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />Dame Judi: You're an Oscar-winner, your talents were wasted here.<br /><br />Vin Diesel: Perhaps you should have insisted on a more thoughtful plot? The plot in this movie tried to portray itself as clever, but with exchanges like "How did you know that's what they did?" "Because that was my plan." you can't expect me to take the plot seriously, can you? Vin, it's a space opera, they're all about timing, and this movie had none, and tried to cover it up with "cleverness". Next time, check out Star Trek II for timing lessons and a more appropriate mix of action, contemplation, big ideas, and personal sacrifice.<br /><br />Thandie Newton: Finally, I am convinced that you can act. Well, your tongue can, at least, in a non-speaking role.<br /><br />Karl Urban: My comment is similar to that for Judi. After The Lord of the Rings, I expected better, at least in terms of movie selections.<br /><br />Nice special effects were wasted on a poorly scripted and directed movie about a man who brings down a galactic jihad. This DVD is going out for resale.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>So, Judi Dench plays "Puck" in this semi-tribute to Bill's "Midsummer Knight's Dream".

I never actually realized how much of a highly anticipated movie this was, considering the new Director's Cut of Pitch Black was released and an animated series of films called Dark Fury.  Vin Diesel is back as Richard B. Riddick in this action-packed, special effects extravaganza.  I tried to make some sort of plot but I just couldn't find one.  The story while completely incoherrent is luckily saved with some dazzling<br />special effects and hot action.  The planet Helion Prime is invaded by the Necromongers led by Lord Marshall (played nicely by Colm Feore).  The Necromongers are a deadly force, destroying all life in their path.  Riddick must stop them.  I must say that this is one of the most entertaining sci-fi flicks<br />I've seen since the Matrix trilogy.  The rest of the cast includes Thandie Newton, Dame Judi Dench (guess she needed money), Alexa Davolos, Karl Urban and others.  The sets are astonishing and the budget (I'm not sure of what it is) really does show.<br />  The Chronicles of Riddick has been getting mostly negative reviews but it's a fun movie, one which obviously shouldn't be taken too seroiusly.  I must say I had some doubts when I leared that this film was rated PG-13, considering Pitch Black was "R" and had some gore, though the fights were a lot more intense and there were more of them. The film is rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Violent Action and Some Language.  The action in this movie does bring to mind the movie "The Matrix," but the action is still cool and intense.  There are quite a few fight sequences (more action than in the first movie)  with impaling but the fights remain bloodless and nongraphic.  There is some occasional profanity, not too strong as well as mild sexual innuendo.  Overall, a fun enjoyable sci-fi sequel which I<br />fun in watching, worth seeing in theatres, but if you chose not too, definitely check out at Blockbuster.  See Pitch Black if you haven't yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>This sequel-of-sorts to Pitch Black finds Riddick (Diesel) arriving on New Mecca, there to battle an invading empire of Borg-style Necromongers (!), aliens who seek to eradicate the entire human race.

Same thing with 'special effects' .... trust me ... you havent seen special effects until you pop this DVD into the player.<br /><br />I understand that Van Diesel was very much involved in the creative process of this movie and most certainly it's his acting that makes it both believable and work. Unfortunately I can't say that I'm an 'aficionado' of the series or the genre and I was lucky enough to have my son with me when we watched to film to explain some of the undercurrents ..... The DVD itself has numerous bonus tracks for those of you that have to see this film 'cold' ..... The extra tracks are superb and you'll be able to call yourself a Riddick 'expert' in a flash .....<br /><br />Since it's not the kind of movie that spoon feeds the viewer, slapping you in the face with the obvious, I have a fear that it may be a while till the next of this series is cut.

Not because of the opulent sets and costumes but simply because for the first 30 minutes or so I had absolutely no idea what was going on.<br /><br />Now keep in mind I saw and loved the previous film Pitch Black (And if there was any justice in Hollywood Pitch Black star Rahda Mitchell would be getting 20 million dollar paychecks and Van Diesel would be doing walk on roles in Colin Farrell vehicles) and I saw that 30-minute anime that was supposed to fill in the plot (needless to say it doesn't).<br /><br />The film Dune was criticized for its ponderous 15 minute opening narration and while I wouldn't inflict that particular torture on any other movie some idea of what is going on was clearly in order. Chronicles of Riddick on the other hand starts of mired in confusion. Even for those that had seen the previous film(s).<br /><br />It then quickly hits a low point with seizure inducing battle flashes and a little girl melting Riddick's heart in a scene right out of the Grinch that Stole Christmas. But as soon as I was reaching for the eject button the movie strangely morph's into Alien 3 (or Star Trek VI the Undiscovered Country take your pick.)<br /><br />See Riddick was going to save Jack the twelve year old girl who pretended to be a boy and now looks and dresses like a supermodel because she is safely located in an otherwise all male prison. Yeah that one kind of lost me too. However the action scenes pick up again and enough back story drifts in so that the biblical/Shakespearian plot comes into focus.<br /><br />You see Riddick was born on a planet called Krypton, and then he was placed in the reeds to escape the pharaoh or was it King Herod'. anyway the guy married to Lady MacBeth. No! Not the one with the Billy Ray Cyrus mullet. He was Lady MacBeth's lover Lancelot. See clear as day.<br /><br />Sure the bad guy wears that mask from Amadeus and his troops look like Gwar started a dance troop. But many of the sets and costumes carry the day. The special effects are very well done (with the possible exception of the CGI Hellhounds) and the music certainly could have been worse.<br /><br />The basic problem is the three main characters left over from Pitch Black have gotten the warm and fuzzies. I've explained supermodel Jack above and I understand why the Imam character had to be significantly toned down post 9/11 but why change Riddick?<br /><br />He hugs puppies (okay Hellhounds) and children. All the appeal of the character from the first movie seems to be missing. He still talks the talk but the walk is very different. Looks like someone lost a pair.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Riddick is sci-fi heaven. This movie has it all. An awesome anti hero/hero.

It is the complete package, and brings a much needed darker space opera world to the big screen.<br /><br />Call the Chronicles of Riddick the anti-Star Wars, if you will. I mean that as a compliment. I love Star Wars, but this is definately the anti-hero version. The Chronicles of Riddick is gritty, dark and intense. There are no "beww, beww" laser beams here. Nope.

The story is a bit complicated but understandable and interesting.  The performances aren't to good here, vin does a belivable but kind of boring performance, and no body else really shines, the old lady is alright, but vin probably gives the best performance.  Overall its a very well done sci fi action movie, the f/x and fights stand out more then anything else(which is a good thing, but maybe the rest of the movie could use a little more attention) so i give it an 8 out of a 10, and its definetly worth a look, i would wait for the extended dvd though the director already said he is goin to release a longer version of the film which is what i plan to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>I can imagine the the meetings... Did you know Hollywood producers and scum use the term "urban market" to avoid being called racist.

I don't quite get how people look at cgi and think it looks real.<br />I suppose it is a very willful suspension of disbelief. Give it a few years and all these cgi movies will look fake and terrible and people will laugh at them.<br /><br />The plot is messy, the dialog not too bright. The acting campy. But it is a fun ride. I admit it grew on me. Saw some on TV and it doesn't stink as much as I first thought. It looked as if a boardroom in Hollywood had come to the conclusion they need a more urban, "hip" hero for today's youth market or something. Like the scene with the pitbull alien beast.

Riddick in search of refugee finds help from one of the survivors of the first movie Abu "Imam" al-Walid (Keith David) it seems the refugee is futile, this is due to the unexpected attack by some outlanders known as Necromongers; their task is to conquer,conquer like the romans..funny thing is they are dressed in a similiar fashion.<br /><br />anyways the movie does have some good points,such as descent visual effects,nicely choreographed fight scenes. but the rest is stupidity beyond imagination. the acting is stale,the lines are that of someone with no experience. the ending is abrupt and tedious. Its beyond me how both Thandie Newton and Judi Dench acepted to work in this garbage. as i said the effects are cool,so is the designing of the whole movie...but thats it;the remaining of the film is just crap and more crap. the editing is also very cheap..which is wierd for a big budget movie like this one. just watch it if you are a fan of the first,dont exprect a masterpiece,expect a dumb sci-fi movie.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 1 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's not interesting in my opinion.

Diesel sleepwalks through the part of Riddick, barely managing to sputter out even the few paltry lines of dialogue the screenwriter has seen fit to assign to him.  About the only point of interest in the otherwise dull and tedious enterprise is why the classy Judi Dench chose this particular neighborhood to go slumming in.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Oops, should be one star. Why can't we change that?<br /><br />First of all, the movie itself was tedious. Watching Diesel in those goggles is painful. Hearing him deliver those lines ... more painful. Not that anyone in this movie fares much better; there is a lot of grimacing and gritting of teeth - probably a physical reaction from having to deliver those lines - while the numerous sci-fi cliches play out (the prison being the most tired of all).<br /><br />But in the core of the movie, there's a surprise!<br /><br />Let's see ... the guards of Helion Prime look like Christian Knights ... there's that Muslim Imam from Pitch Black ... Judi Dench talks about fire and water, air and earth, perhaps representing paganism or Greek philosophy ... or, as she says, calculation, which would be cold logic ...<br /><br />Oddly enough, this movie seems to be an allegory - Darwinism's (or liberalism's) long war against religion and reason - convert to our way or die. No other faiths are allowed, as in Richard Dawkins' wildest fantasies. (Dawkins has intimated that doubters of evolutionism are evil or wicked. As Behe has pointed out, it's not a big step from saying people are wicked to doing something about that wickedness.)<br /><br />The Darwinist's weapons are technological, perhaps representing their faith in science and progress. Their reasoning is soupy and, along with their faith, is quasi-religious, demanding the surrender of individual reason and choice. Conversion is not of the mind of heart, but by coercion. Join or die; like join or your career dies, like that of Virginia Steen-McIntyre, whose radiometric dates for ancient tools were a couple of hundred thousand years too old and was banned from her field of science, or the hapless graduate students who dared to write papers pointing out Darwinism's flaws.<br /><br />Thus the Lord Marshall's "Take it on faith," the Darwinist mantra.<br /><br />The Necromongers' fascination with death mirrors the neo-liberal culture of death, and Darwinism's faith in the creative power of death. The communication device using some sort of human being brings to mind Darwinism's and Marxism's machinistic view of human life - we are just tools to spread our genes, we are just instruments of the State.<br /><br />As the Lord Marshall has seen the Underverse and returned, so has Darwinism died a thousand deaths, stabbed to death by evidence ("Forbidden Archeology" by Cremo, OOPARTS, etc.) and reason ("Darwin's Black Box" by Behe), only to be resurrected by unreason.<br /><br />Who would've thought?</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie although I wasn't familiar with Riddick from my sci-fi reading--I assume it's an idea from the graphic novel genre. The story visually and thematically combines elements of Egyptian theology, Greek iconography, and good old Roman military theory and ideals, along with some tried and true elements derived from traditional fantasy and science fiction. Along with the stunning visual effects, the result is a visually appealing and action filled movie that held my interest for the full two hours.<br /><br />I don't know who designed all the sets or the visuals, but he did a spectacular job, and the whole the movie has a unified and consistent look that is very convincing. The prison world is also very well done. The escape scene on the prison world where they show the effects of the deadly solar terminator is just terrific. Vin Diesel is perfect in the role of Riddick and seemed made for the part. Overall, I thought this was an exciting and entertaining movie based on the Riddick story line that I'm sure won't disappoint the fans. I give it four stars here, but really, I think it rates four and a half.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"The Chronicles of Riddick" is a very watchable Sci-Fi action movie that is the last in the Riddick series (following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RTCP1A">Pitch Black  [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001O3YA8">Dark Fury - The Chronicles of Riddick (Animated)</a>). While it does have a few characters from the the first two movies, it could almost stand on its own since the back-story really isn't too important to the main plot line.<br /><br />No spoilers from me; Vin Diesel reprises his role as the fugitive Riddick, a very tough, no nonsense survivalist in the truest sense of the word. There are a lot of new elements added the Riddick universe, including a few new races, and issues much grander in scope than the previous movies. While Riddick is a very cold killer who is capable of explosive violence, he also is very loyal to those he considers worthwhile.<br /><br />The special effects are very impressive in places and I really liked the feel of the environments created for the movie, with some of the Necromonger technology being the creepiest I have ever seen. The various fight scenes are all well done and are some of the best in any movie in this genre.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Vin Diesel reprises his role as Riddick in THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK.  The character first came to life in the movie PITCH BLACK.  In the first movie, Riddick is portrayed as a cold-hearted killer who happens to have the skills to get himself and a few survivors off a deadly world.  In CHRONICLES, he gets remade into a brooding loner/anti-hero whose destiny is to save worlds.  It's a huge step, and not one most moviegoers -- including fans -- can take in a single swallow.<br /><br />On the other hand, the upgrade to cutting-edge computer generated imagery is absolutely stellar.  When you see Helion Prime and the other worlds and sets on the screen, the tendency is to believe that they really exist.  The world just comes across as incredibly real.<br /><br />The problem is that the film is somewhat lackluster, depending on the star power of Diesel (not a bad bet) and some of the other supporting actors and actresses to move the story along.  Unfortunately, not much character comes to light.  Riddick is busy telling everybody that the fight with the Necromongers (who come entirely too close to the Borg from Star Trek for my liking) isn't his.  He tells them this while standing in the doomed city the Necromongers are currently taking over.  Talk about timing!<br /><br />Personally if I'd been Riddick, I'd have just found a new place to hide and disappeared for another five years.<br /><br />Still, the film delivers on more than the CG and visual splash.  There are plenty of over-the-top fights and near-death escapdes that will keep you in your seat waiting to see how it all turns out.<br /><br />There's a cliffhanger of an ending, though, but Diesel has stated that there will be two more films in the Riddick continuity.  He hasn't said when those will be coming out.  But for a B-grade SF movie night with your buddies and a generous portion of whiz-bang graphics to show off your new HD DVD player, you can't go wrong with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I thought this movie wasn't bad. It did start a little slow, but soon thereafter caught my full attention. I had to change mental gears from expecting a Pitch Black sequel/clone, but not in a bad way at all. And there ARE tie-ins with Pitch Black plainly evident unless you aren't particularly observant or haven't seen Pitch Black. I thought the special effects were some of the best I have seen quite some time, and after I began to become adjusted to the more involved background story, I found it engrossing. I felt that the characters had some depth to them. Enough for me to care a little about a few of them anyway, and Riddick became a little less of a cardboard cut-out, and a little more intricate in this movie. Some of the action sequences are also pretty impressive. I find it quite disappointing that this did not do better in theaters.  I hope that they continue the series with the next one? or two? movies that have been rumored to be following.<br /><br />Those who found the movie itself disappointing, I would guess would be: 1) Hardcore sci-fi, or action movie fans who spent way too much time making mental comparisons to their favorite storyline/universe, or acting star during a movie to actually just enjoy the movie. 2) People who just wanted straight up action without all of the intricate details of a sci-fi storyline. 3) People expecting a sequel to Pitch black that didn't grow or expand on the storyline or character, who couldn't switch gears.<br /><br />I took this film as THIS film, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not spend the entire movie making mental comparisons to other sci-fi or action movies or stars. Yes some of its ideas have been used before. So what? Plumbing was an idea used by the ancient Greek and roman civilizations. Should we not use plumbing, because someone else used it before? If you spend all of the time during the movie making comparisons, then you might not give the movie the full attention it deserves.<br /><br />For any who enjoy a good sci-fi action movie with a little thought behind it, and don't have some holy grail to compare it with, I would highly recommend this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>But when it was done, all I wanted to do was re-write it. Fix it, make it better. It was, to be honest, awful. Absolutely nothing like Pitch Black, which was a solid Sci-Fi movie; this was a sort of sci-fi-fnatasy-horror-mix, and a badly done one. It could have been so good, if only the'd done a bit more reasoning and a bit less wandering around.<br /><br />Riddick is living alone on an ice world when bounty hunters chase him down - blah, blah - the plot gets complicated (unnecessarily so) from there on out. Oh, I SO want to fix this movie. It really had so much potential and it wasted all of it. Just, someone, give me a budget and I swear I'll make it all better...<br /><br />It makes me angry just thinking about it. Grrrr. If Vin Deisel were here I'd yell at him.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>What I mean is this film is one of the best action films of the year, and I'm not comparing this to Kill Bill. "The Chronicles of Riddick" has no character development, no plot, in fact the video game is way better. In fact all Vin diesel does is trash talk, show his muscles, and adds no demension to the character. I want to know more about Riddick, I want to think more about Riddick, did he have a family before he became what he is, or are they just going to subject us to mindless action and no plot. Hopefully they'll add a third intallment, so I can find out. This film needs better acting and more meaning behind the action. "Kill Bill" showed that behind all of that blood thirsty action that there was a love story in the middle of it all. Why can't we get the same treatment and let it be entertaining as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Able to leap thirty feet into the air in a single bound! Faster than The Matrix! Stronger than the California Governor! Look, it's a rocket! It's a super-fast computer program! No, it's Riddick! <p>Science Fiction afficionados will undoubtedly have fun examining THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK for its hidden layers and (hopefully) for what the next installment in the chronicles might hold. <p>This film is loosely based on the director's-David Twohy-2000 sleeper hit, PITCH BLACK, which introduced us to the butt-kicking, muscle-bound, dark hero Riddick, a conflicted man with a suspicious past and a "shine" in his eye that allows him to see in the dark.<p>In this new Summer release we get to see more of Riddick and learn about his sketchy past. Apparently he's a Furian (a thought-to-be extinct group of humans with...well...I'm not sure what. But he sure can move fast, fight fast and kill fast. Oh! Maybe THAT'S what a Furian is!). And he's been prompted to join in a fight against a group of world conquerors known as The Necromongers (think Gladiators with high tech armor that looks like something from the film Stargate). <p>When Riddick is `summoned' to the planet Helion Prime he discovers that the planet is under imminent threat of attack by The Necromongers and, before he can leave, the planet is indeed attacked. Riddick is captured (thanks to a beautiful Necromonger played by Thandie Newton) and brought in front of The Lord Marshall of the Necromongers (played by a pretty sinister Colm Feore) for a kind of reverse mind melding where, to the horror of The Lord Marshall, it is discovered that Riddick is the last of the Furians. Since The Lord Marshall was foretold that he would be killed by a Furian, he orders the immediate death of Riddick. But before this can happen, our reluctant hero makes an amazing escape and flees to (or rather is captured by mercenaries and taken to) the planet Crematoria, a small planetary body where it's 700 degrees in direct sunlight and minus-300 degrees in the dark. Here we encounter Jack, the boy who was a girl in PITCH BLACK, all grown up and trying to be a carbon copy of Riddick. <p>Meanwhile, back on Helion Prime, an Air Elemental creature that wisps from here to there like a gaseous anomaly (I've always wanted to say that!), played surprisingly well by Dame Judi Dench, is captured by The Necromongers and is being used by The Lord Marshall to discover if Riddick really IS a Furian and where he might be and if he's still alive. <p>A blurring set of battles and eye-popping CGI pulls the story along as Riddick and a group of runaway prisoners escape from Crematoria and head back to Helion Prime in an attempt to rescue Jack (who was captured during the battle), the ONE person that Riddick cares most about. <p>Does this sound like a lot of information? It is and, in truth, I haven't even scratched the surface of this film's layers. There are new religions introduced, strange technologies, traitorous activities, and the beginnings of the next film, all encapsulated in this oddly stilted movie. <p>Complaints: My concerns would have to be directed toward the lack of information about certain aspects in plot. For example: What exactly ARE the Furians? Where did they come from? And the "Elementals?" Are there Fire Elementals and Earth Elementals as well as Air Elementals? What type of religion is it that The Necromongers practice? We never see any ceremonies or religious symbolism. The Necromongers strive to find their place in something called `The Underverse', but we are never told what or where this place is and exactly WHY The Necromongers are so steadfast in getting there.<p>Usually, when you start a series or `chronicles', you set up the aforementioned items, giving some backstory while drawing the viewer in. Maybe Mr. Twohy will do this in his next installment, but to me this seems kind of backward.  <p>Maybe it's just me, though.<p>B-minus rating</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>Although I liked Pitch Black more because of its darker nature, Chronicles of Riddick is absolutely an entertaining movie to watch. It is a little disturbing that the character of Riddick was changed into somekind of SF Chuck Norris, but still the movie holds together very well as the special effects and the costumes look impressive. If they could find a director that is able to return to the atmoshere of Pitch Black, I even think there could be a succesfull part three. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Riddick (David Twohy, 2004)<br /><br />You can't go into a film with a name like The Chronicles of Riddick and not know it's going to be cheesy as all get-out. If you take it in that light, it's not a bad movie at all. If you go in expecting Pitch Black, however, you're in for quite a disappointment.<br /><br />All the things Twohy did wrong about Pitch Black are still here (especially the confusing rapid-fire camera-angle cutting combined with lack of storyline; the same technique used to confuse and annoy the viewer during Pitch Black's crash-landing makes an appearance at the beginning of this film, as well. In Twohy's defense, he does a much better job of it about two-thirds of the way through this film), but a lot of what was right about the first film is missing. Some of that has to do with the scope of the picture; it's much easier to build complex characters when your whole cast is seven people. Riddick has a cast of thousands, and it shows; very few characters here are more than cardboard, including some of the main characters. Judi Dench is utterly wasted here (more for lack of screen time than anything inherent in her character), and Karl Urban, as the necromonger (I mean, come on, the movie has a race called necromongers. Cheese city!) sent to kill Riddick, could have had a wonderful part. Instead, he's played as two-dimensionally as possible. Etc.<br /><br />Still, if you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off action flick, you could do worse. And did you ever think you'd see Vin Diesel with hair, much less dreadlocks? **</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>I was very suprised that this film really strayed from "Pitch Black."  That film was exciting, scary, and really fun.  I thought another film with Riddick might be fun, but it wasn't a lot of fun.  This is an overlong, overexposed, and over narrative sci fi yarn that looked good, but was empty inside.  The film made little sense, and took itself far too seriously.  Judi Densch must have lost a bet to stay in this dribble that is only saved by some well staged fight scenes and some brisk direction in spots to move it along.  The acting is wooden, and the screenplay introduces a lot of new characters, but fails to develop them, nor make them likable enough that we care what happens to them.  Only die hard sci fi fans will enjoy, otherwise it still is worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>With "The Chronicles of Riddick" director David Twohy takes the same approach as James Cameron did with "Aliens"--change the focus of the story and don't make a sequel as much as an extension of the first film. While the first film borrowed from "Alien" (as much as "Alien" borrowed from "It! The Terror from Beyond Space" or the atmospheric "Planet of the Vampires" and other B-movies), "The Chronicles of Riddick" builds a mythology for Riddick, Jack and Imam. Riddick is very much an anti-hero in the mold of the Man with No Name. Like that character it appears that Riddick develops a conscience--coming closer to his abandoned humanity through his encounters with Jack, Imam and others.<br /><br />Five years have passed since "Pitch Black". Riddick, still on the run, is being hunted by more Mercs for a big payout. One of the people searching for him is Imam one of the survivors who befriended Riddick in "Pitch Black". Imam needs Riddick's help in opposing the Necromongers a race that worships death and destruction. The Lord Marshall (Colm Feore marvelous as always)has plans to conquer the known universe and using those resources to take his followers to the Underverse a mysterious place that changes the essential nature of humanity in a dark way.<br /><br />Imam knows the legend that only a Furion may defeat the Lord Marshall. He hopes that Riddick will help the people of his adopted world fight back and survive the coming attack. Urged on by one of the Elementals (Judi Dench), Riddick considers their offer and rejects it. He just wants to get on with his life. As in "Pitch Black" Riddick gets drawn into the conflict because those that he learns to care about are threatened by the Necromongers. When the Lord Marshall discovers Riddick's identity he tries to have him killed when he won't serve him.<br /><br />Now Riddick must find Jack (Alexa Davalos)now known as Kyra who has gone to a prison planet in search of him, save her and get revenge for the killing of those he cares about.<br /><br />A marvelous space opera, Twohy has crafted a suspenseful film that manages to channel the best elements of the Spagetti Westerns, 50's science fiction space operas like "This Island Earth", science fiction pulp stories from the 40's and 50's and has merged them into an entertaining larger than life story that provides the epic scope of a "Lord of the Rings" within a space opera context. It's a fun movie that has great action, stunts and optical effects. It's not meant to be deep although, like Sergio Leone's westerns, there's more here than meets the eye and dismissing it out of hand is unfair.<br /><br />The "Unrated Director's Cut" is the better of the two versions. it has fifteen minutes of additional footage, character development and background on Riddick's people and what happened to them. While the picture occasionally jumps when segueing from the theatrical cut to the "Director's Cut" (due to cuts made to the negative), it's not disruptive enough to disturb the story. Twohy has proven himself an adept director with supernatural thrillers ("Below")and other science fiction thrillers ("The Arrival") to his credit. He creates a compelete world for Riddick that was lacking in the suspense thriller "Pitch Black". It's a much bigger film with a much different type of story but, essentially, the same character at its core.<br /><br />The film sports an outstanding high definition transfer. There's also an audio commentary track full of fascinating tid bits featuring Karl Urban (also from "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Bourne Supremacy" as well as a deadringer for a young David Gilmour of Pink Floyd fame), Alexa Davalos ("Jack" or "Kyra") and director Twohy. It's full of interesting trivia about the genesis of the project through the end of production. There's also quite a bit of discussion on the background of characters, changes to the script prior to production and some of the physical challenges the actors and director faced during production.<br /><br />The featurettes include "Toombs Chase Logs" (he's one of the Mercs aka Mercenary bounty hunters hunting Riddick), a virtual guide that pulls in viewers into Riddick's world from the various perspectives of the characters. "Riddick Insider Facts on Demand" provides scene specific trivia about various parts of the film and the characters. "Riddick's World" features Vin Diesel on a tour behind-the-scenes along with 360 degree virtual glimpse at the various sets from the film.<br /><br />A marvelous and underrated space opera adventure, "The Chronicles of Riddick" is quite a different film from "Pitch Black" and the anime prequel. The fact that Twohy wasn't willing to just repeat himself and came up with new and challenging material is to his credit. It's also why the film is as solid an action adventure saga as it is. Give "The Chronicles of Riddick" a chance and disregard the mainstream critics. You won't be sorry you did.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Universal / Region Free<br />VC-1 BD-50 / AACS<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />Running time: 2:14:06 (Director's cut) / 1:59:00 (Theatrical cut)<br />Feature size: 24,87 GB (DC)<br />Disc size: 49,00 GB<br />Total bit rate: 24.73 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 14.01 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4364 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 4364 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br />DTS Express  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Express  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / 24-bit<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French<br />Number of chapters: 28<br /><br />Special features presented in standard definition<br /><br />#An Introduction by David Twohy (0:45)<br />#Commentary with Writer/Director David Twohy and Actors Karl Urban & Alexa Davalo<br />#Deleted Scenes (14:06)<br />#Virtual Guide to Chronicles of Riddick (7:40)<br />#Toombs Chase Log (9:56)<br />#Creation of New Mecca (11:12)<br />#Riddick Rises (13:26)<br />#Keep What You Kill (17:30)<br />#U-Control - Picture-in-Picture<br />--Cast and crew interviews<br />--Complete Chronicles<br />--Chronicles Compendium<br />--Anatomy of a Fight<br />#BD-Live enabled</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>The Theatrical version is actually better than the director's version.

This is the easily Vin Diesel's best role as it was playing the same character in "Pitch Black." The story is a little too detailed for this type of film, but it actually makes the film seem more for us people with an IQ of at least 100, which is much better than seeing a pure brainless Sci-Fi affair. There is some comedy (Diesel has some great one-liners) and the Special Effects are very good. The 100 Million dollar price tag on this film obviously went to Vin Diesel and the SFX. I was worried the PG-13 would detract from the enjoyment I had of actually seeing a little gore like in "Pitch Black," but the action scenes were full of so much energy and Diesel's powerful movements that I did not miss all the blood and guts that really were not needed in this movie. So in short, grab a few of your friends and head to see this Sci-Fi/Action Adventure while it is still on the Big Screen!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Five years ago, escaped convict Richard B.

After five years wandering across the outskirts of the galaxy and being hunted by bounty hunters calming the bounty on his head, Riddick arrives on the colonized planet New Mecca, he learns Imam placed the bounty on his head and Jack has been imprisoned on the prison planet "Crematoria" for murder. Riddick learns from Aereon, ambassador of the Elemental race is seeking out Furians, a race of warriors in a bid to balance the universe, as a warrior army known as The Necromongers led by the evil undead Lord Marshal are invading every planet in the galaxy and cleansing all of humanity in their goal for universal conquest.

Can you believe the madness?<br /><br />"The Chronicles of Riddick" continues the story of a Furian boldly named Riddick (Vin Diesel). Riddick from "Pitch Black" fame emerges from hiding due to an aggressive, money hungry bounty hunter Toombs (Nick Chinlund). Riddick slashes his way back into the limelight on the planet Helion Prime. He confronts a world conquering Lord Marshal (Colm Feore), a Necromonger, who is trying to assimilate planets into his Underverse way of life. The Necromongers are "Death from above" brainwashed assimilated, conquered planet members. (What's that?)<br /><br />Riddick jumps to the forefront to help save the world from being conquered. With his night vision sight and unfazed confidence, Riddick fights his way to the final showdown. (Sight unseen)<br /><br />This movie has awesome special effects and fight scenes. The very hot, hot Crematoria planet jail escape is like putting your hand in a freezer for an hour, then in a butane blue torch flame.<br /><br />I will patiently wait in line to purchase this DVD as pure entertainment. Enough said!</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I am among those who The Chronicles of Riddick so I jumped at the chance to have the director's cut of the film, which includes 15 additional minutes.  The new footage may not be noticed by everyone but it does make a subtle difference.  For example, Kyra (Riddick's love interest) in introduced by a short sequence of her arrival at the planet prison Cremitoria.  The scene helps the viewer to connect later references to her before Riddick ends up at the prison.<br /><br />The reviews here are sharply divided into those who like the film and those who don't see anything good in it.  The story is similar to other plot lines: an unscrupulous militaristic master race is taking over world after world and stripping it of resources.  They are also a group that forces the conquered people to become one of them.  This sounds something like a cross between Independence Day and Star Trek.  The Chronicles of Riddick has some very impressive special effects.  The Necromongers travel in space ships with anthropomorphic figures that lend them a coldness befitting military conquerors.  The ghost-like quality of Judi Dench's character is very well done as are the lightening quick movements of the Lord Marshall.  Calling this a realization of a lavish graphic novel is close to the mark.<br /><br />The performances are good: Vin Diesel does a fine job as the Furian anti-hero; Colm Feore (as he is usually cast) makes a fine villain.  It was interesting for me to see Karl Urban as Vaako out of his Lord of the Rings makeup and Thandie Newton was a nice addition as his ambitious wife.  Judi Dench may be thought wasted in Riddick but must we compare her performance in this film to something like Shakespeare in Love?  Judging by what she said about making the film, Ms Dench had a lot of fun.  And, yes, Vin Diesel does wear goggles, but the reason he wears them is part of his character not just a mindless prop.  In other supporting roles, Nick Chinlund, who plays the leader of the mercenaries that capture Riddick, does a great job as the indecisive and sleazy Toombs.<br /><br />I don't think critics care much for movie that just seeks to entertain.  So I can recommend this movie for the wild ride that it is - just plain fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Well, no, not really, I'm not. But Riddick's enemies---and by Furia, he has a passle of them in "The Chronicles of Riddick", David Twohy's follow-up to the rousing monster-mash "Pitch Black"---should be. Oh yes indeed.<br /><br />Riddick (good old shaven-pated Vin Diesel doing his raspy, surly, growly thang), if you remember, is that amoral piece of space-trash, former Level 3 Max-Lockup prisoner, that intergalactic rogue who was all in it for himself, Devil take the hindmost, lead, follow, or get out of the way. Oh, and he had those funky eyes (chiefly covered up by his hip goggles) that fixed the old boy up with nightvision. So when the Going gets Dark, Riddick gets Going.<br /><br />Boy does he ever: he slices, he dices, he does double flips, he twists and leaps and hurdles, he kicks and tears and shoves blades in just about every possible spot you'd think to shove a blade. So yeah, if I'm facing down Riddick, I'm afraid of the Dark.<br /><br />It's a few years after the fun wholesome family carnage in "Pitch Black". Riddick has been camped out on the amusingly named UV-6, presumably chasing Taun-Tauns and making snow-angels. Bad boy bounty hunter Toombs shows up, Riddick does his thing, and ends up heading across the galaxy to Helion Prime, to find out exactly why somebody from his past put a very big bounty on his shiny bald head.<br /><br />Riddick hooks up briefly with his old space-traveling Muslim pal Imam (Keith David, who looks like he's channeling up Malcolm X), and then gets a way impressive introduction to the Galaxy's latest Axis of Evil (they even bring their own Axis): the Necromongers. Convert or Kill, and Keep what you Kill: that's the Necromonger way.<br /><br />The Necromongers are real party-poopers, by the way. They introduce themselves by crashing their huge phallus-shaped spaceships into your planet, kill or convert everybody, give boring speeches about "verses" (yeah, the Helion Prime people were scared, but when Linus Roache's Necromonger Purifier starts babbling about "other verses" you could see their eyes glaze over...mine did....zzzz...shut up or kill me), then burn the planet to the ground. Their leader, the Lord Marshall (Colm Feore), is also big into boring speeches and zig-zagging around his helpless victims. Show-off.<br /><br />Not even the hotty Lady Macbeth-like Necromonger princess Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) has much fun: she works hard at giving her lover/pawn Lord Vaako Karl Urban a spine, and puts her eye-makeup on with a Bic lighter. Blegh.<br /><br />Can't an old space pirate just find a little hooch and a place to flop? Well, you know what happens when you get between a rogue like Riddick and a hot meal: Riddick does what he does best, which is thrash.<br /><br />Frankly, I saw "Chronicles" after about a case of very good Laphroaig, and it made no sense; after I sobered up, I saw it again. It still makes no sense. But frankly, that's all good: all I wanted was a movie in which Riddick would snarl, slaughter some foolish mortals, rinse, repeat. I got it!<br /><br />And the movie is indeed a pretty thing: stuff blows up, Riddick and his buddies run across the prison-planet Crematoria from a really ambitious sun, there are gunfights and massacres and guttings galore, Twohy shows off all the eye-candy at his disposal, and Judy Dench floats around a lot. I still have no idea what she was doing, but hey: the point is, it all looks pretty. It has lots of slaughter. Alexa Davalos (Kyra/Jack) is cute and deadly, always a nice combo.<br /><br />Diesel's goggles alone should win an Oscar: the man takes them off, shoves them back on, takes them off, and not once does he have to clean 'em! I want a pair.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>I normally hate to compare a film to its sequel(s), but for Chronicles of Riddick I will have to because it just doesn't stand on its own.  Having an understanding of the back story from Pitch Black is necessary to navigate through this choppy  plot - but since I assume that a large portion of viewers will be purchasing this film expecting a continuation of the characters and quality from that movie, I think it is my duty to point out how very much COR deviates.<br /><br />COR takes place several years after the events in PB.  Riddick has been on the run from various people in that time, but at the opening of the film he is running from bounty hunters hired by a private party for a very choice sum.  Of course Riddick has to find out who and why, which takes him across space to look up an old friend.  Coincidentally, that very planet is attacked shortly after he arrives.  It would seem that an evil death-worshipping religion has been sweeping the universe, killing all who will not convert, and a rogue being called an Elemental has purposefully lured Riddick there so that she can enlist his help in fighting them.  Through various flashbacks and offhand remarks from other characters we learn that Riddick is one of the few survivors of a race from the planet Furia which was also devastated by the Necromags, so naturally, he'd want revenge, right?  And of course he can be expected to singlehandedly defeat an evil empire if he wanted to.  But Furions are also contrarians, and Riddick is a confirmed loner, baby.  He can't be tied down, has to be free, blah blah.  But then the Necromongers annoy him by killing his pal, so watch out, now it's personal!<br /><br />I think that fans of PB will find that the pace, plot and tight storytelling of that first film is absent here.  COR shifts focus constantly, jumping around visions and events and leaving holes in the plot which I can only assume are due to bad editing.  The story tries to take on too much subject matter - a whole occultic warrior culture, Riddick's conflicted relationship with Jack/Kira from PB, the mysteries of Furia, Furions, and the race of Elementals - in too short a time.  I'm not any dumber than the average viewer, but this was a very confusing experience for me.<br /><br />By far the thing that threw me the most was how differently the character of Riddick was portrayed by the same actor in this film  Our anti-hero lost his mystery and much of his appeal this time around.  Vin Diesel was chilling and unfathomable in PB; now he starts to seem like any other super alpha male on an ultraviolent killing rampage.  Oh yes, there's lots of that going on, but this time humans compose the body count instead of monsters.  Riddick is now a modern action movie clich&eacute;.  I found it hard to root for him.<br /><br />The most impressive part of COR was evident in the high-budget art direction.  The set and costume designs for the Necromongers were convincingly dark and beautiful in the tradition of Giger (Alien/Aliens).  The special effects were good, the fiery scenes on the surface of the planet Crematoria were believable.  Lots of eye candy to be had.<br /><br />The end of this film strongly suggests that there is an opening for another sequel in the works.  Gads, I hope not...unless the editor can get his act together.  I suspect that the director's version  of COR is better than this theatrical release, and that maybe the third film will learn from the mistakes of the second.  My advice:  if you are still fan enough of Riddick to brave COR, check out the director's cut and skip this one.<br /><br />--Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>So, now we're introduced to the epic world of Riddick's universe (underverse).  I think it's a little strange now that the titles of the three movies in order go like this:  The Chronicles of Riddick:  Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, and The Chronicles of Riddick.  Anyway, I feel that Keith David's talent and character were completely wasted in this film.  It just seems like something Paul Anderson would do (not giving anything away).  Another thing is the fact that this universe is SOOOO different from the more dirty/realistic atmosphere of the first movie, and even Dark Fury really can't explain this.  Another thing is that there's no talk of superhuman armies taking over galaxies in Pitch Black, you'd think something like that would be big news but it just sort of jumps out at us in this film.  It just feels a little too epic compared to the first movie.  Anyway, the action and special effects completely make up for this.  One thing I don't understand is why Universal releases 2 seperate versions of the films.  Theatrical and Director's Cut.  That's really dumb IMO.  Well, when the 3rd Riddick movie comes out there'll be a box set, and that's when I'll get the DVD's.</p></br></body></html>

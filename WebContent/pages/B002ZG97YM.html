In the small island of Berk, a scrawny but inventive teenage Viking named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) hopes of earning the respect of his father (Gerard Butler) and the rest of the village by slaying his first dragon, but when he stumbles upon a frightened and injured beast, he can't bring himself to kill it. Hiccup defies centuries of tradition by befriending the dragon he calls Toothless and learns that he must convince his village the errors of their ways. "How to Train Your Dragon" is an interesting and utterly charming family spectacle from the creators of "Shrek" and "Kung Fu Panda". Though the story is pretty straightforward, the animated film is a heartfelt mix of adventure and comedy. The characters are amusing and well developed. The computer animation is certainly stunning. "How to Train Your Dragon" also stars America Ferrara, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Craig Ferguson.<br /><br />DreamWorks has maintain a solid record with the Blu-ray releases of its computer-generated movies and with "How to Train Your Dragon", the studio continues to bring out some must-have additions to your Blu-ray collection. The animated adventure is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen format. The picture quality is flawless with fabulous detail. The DTS-HD 5.1 audio is truly reference-quality. Though a 3-D copy is not included in this release, the Blu-ray features a DVD copy of the film and great extras like the animated short "Legend of the BoneKnapper Dragon", several behind-the-scenes featurettes (Viking-Sized Cast, The Technical Artistry of Dragon, The Story Behind the Story & How to Draw a Dragon), deleted scenes and a commentary track with directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, and producer Bonnie Arnold. Overall, "How to Train Your Dragon" scores an "A-".</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>I have to say that when a Dreamworks Animation film is released my hopes aren't high. From my point of view, they aim mostly for cheap laughs with mediocre stories. However, sometimes they do hit the right string and deliver a throughfully entertaining film with great visuals, characters and story. So far, from the 20-plus films that Dreamworks had released since its foundation, I found only five worth seeing and owning (Shrek, Shrek 2, Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit and Kung Fu Panda). When I walked to a Dreamworks film I never have high hopes like when I enter a Pixar film (all of which are excellent). This year was not the exception and when I saw trailers for How to Train Your Dragon, I never got too much excited about it. All I have to say is that I couldn't be more wrong!!<br /><br />For the first time, I feel that Dreamworks did a film that can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. I haven't seen such a great film produced by Dreamworks since the first Shrek was released. This movie is an instant classic!!<br /><br />Instead of aiming for sitcom-esque jokes like most of his films, HTTYD has what all Pixar films have: a wide appeal. This film can be enjoyed by every member of the family and has a good quality humor and most important of all, a heart (a thing that is usually missing from Dreamworks). Add breathtaking visuals, a magnificent score, action, great characters and you have one of the most compelling animated films of all time. I still think Pixar is better and in fact I think Toy Story 3 is better than this one but without a doubt with HTTYD, Dreamworks make a huge step formward and became closer to Pixar (a step that may have gone backwards again with the fourth and hopefully last Shrek). Do I have more confidence in Dreamworks films? Not really, we'll have to see how Megamind and future films stand. But even if is the beginning of a new era for Dreamworks or an isolated success, HTTYD is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is gorgoeus.You can see every detail in the screen, absolutely magnificent. The 5.1 dolby true HD is equally impressive. The are many nice bonus features (including a new short). Most of them are short but they are fun to watch nontheless.<br /><br />The DVD provided here also looks great for SD but is no match for the BD quality.<br /><br />How To Train Your Dragon is an excellent film that is completely recommended (even if you don? have kids like myself). Congratulations to Dreamworks for showing us that when they want to, they can do great things. Let's hope more films like this one will come in the future from this studio.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Hiccup, the spindly son of a Viking chieftain who does not fit in with the others, lives in a village eternally at war with dragons.  He accidentally grounds a young one during a night attack, tracks it down, and ultimately befriends it.<br /><br />This is a terrific entertainment for kids who aren't too easily scared.  There are plenty of laughs and eye-popping action scenes as well as good messages for young viewers, such as the importance of valuing differences in others, the necessity of cooperation, conquering fear by conquering ignorance, and the fact that it is often braver to put down one's weapons and work for peace than to keep on fighting.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 5:17 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews "How to Train Your Dragon", the latest animated 3D movie from Dreamworks. It stars the voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, and Craig Ferguson.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Who knew that Jay Baruchel sounds exactly like Christian Slater? I mean my wife and I we're shocked when the credits rolled and saw that the lead voice of Hiccup was played by Jay, um, uh, Barawho and not Slater. Anyway....<br /><br />How to Train Your Dragon is a great family movie and it came recommended to me by several friends that don't even have kids. Now, I've seen some animated features (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I654UI">The Incredibles</a>) that could potentially make my all time list of favorite movies, but I'd have to think hard about any animated movie that would make it into my top 20 of all time. And of my top 20 favorite movies half would likely only get 4 versus 5 stars. Dragon would land on a separate list somewhere only in about the middle of the pack of just my favorite "animated" movies. It's a good movie...but classic? Nah.<br /><br />Against his father's will, the timid Hiccup sneaks out with a new weapon he designed. Turns out the weapon works pretty well and he brings down the most feared dragon in the land with it. The weapon doesn't kill the beast, and as the title of the movie might suggest, Hiccup instead forms a friendship with the monster that could change human/dragon relations forever.<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained. My wife thought it was okay. My kids...they liked it. No one was wowed. Perhaps I've spoiled my family with my liberal stance of letting them watch pretty much anything they want (within reason). Or maybe we've all just overdosed on reruns of the early <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DYJTVW">SpongeBob Episodes</a> on DVD. Cuz, I'll tell ya what, if you said to me that Nick is running a marathon of the first 50 SpongeBob episodes or Cartoon Network is premiering How to Train Your Dragon, I'd been tuning into Nick.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIZ4M">Toy Story</a> is a 5 star animated movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXJ">Shrek</a> is a 5 star animated movie. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LVCM">A Bug's Life</a> is a 5 star animated movie. How to Train Your Dragon is a really good animated feature that will soon be forgotten by all who watched on my TV set. Don't get me wrong...Dragon is definitely a worthy rental at minimum. It's just not a classic. But as of this writing about 90% of the other reviewers here might disagree with me, so please take my review for what it's worth: an opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`How to Train our Dragon' has such charming buoyancy about it, a delightful air of warmth that sucks you in and keeps you glued to every frame.  Taking the source material and using it as a mere foundation for a far more accessible story, `How to Train Your Dragon' is one of those rare films that gets the clich&eacute;s just right.  I'm certainly a skeptic when it comes to clich&eacute;s, but certain films underscore them in a way that makes them feel pertinent to the story, and that is the case here.  Instead of transferring the oddly uninspired prose developed in the children's book to the big screen, `How to Train Your Dragon' is something completely different and far more effective thanks to the sharp changes made to the story itself.<br /><br />The film follows an unlikely hero, Hiccup.  Hiccup is a Viking, son to the chief and yet he is, well, not very Viking-like.  He's small and scrawny and peaceable, as opposed to big and brawny and violent.  When all of Hiccup's fellow villagers are waging war against the dragons, slaying them left and right and training their hardest to defend their livelihoods, Hiccup is befriending them.  Soon it becomes apparent to Hiccup that the misconception surrounding these winged beasts needs to be addressed, and changed for the betterment of the Viking people and for the dragons themselves.  With his newfound friend, a rare and dangerous dragon he names Toothless, Hiccup attempts to change the minds of his people, but that is easier said than done.<br /><br />One thing of note regarding this film; it is visually arresting.  The CGI animation is superb, truly.  The character details are wonderful (Toothless himself being a wonder to the eyes) and the editing is as sharp as they come; splicing through scenes with marvelous effect.<br /><br />The story, one of acceptance and love and growth, is exemplified by the simplistic approach to the script.  Like I said, it is one of those films that takes advantage of the clich&eacute;s it possesses.  Having read the source material (and not caring for it much at all), it is nice to see the themes presented in a much farer fashion in this splendid film.  The humor is subtle, yet effective, never beating the audience over the head with manipulated gags and one-liners.  Instead, the film allows the softness of the story to transcend.<br /><br />The themes of loyalty and love are given a nice touch with each passing frame.<br /><br />With tons of excitement and charm to boot, with a story that will appease both kid and adults, `How to Train Your Dragon' is yet another notch in the animation belt of 2010 (god, what a great year for animated films).  Don't worry too much about the thrills here either, as the action is presented in a way that the humor can shine and the scares don't last.  You'll little ones won't be hiding under the blanket or complaining of nightmares here.<br /><br />This one is all fun and games!</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>How to Train Your Dragon is the latest from the stable of Dreamworks, but apart from the animation style, you'd never know it.<br /><br />How to Train Your Dragon is the story of Hiccup, a Viking who feels out of place since he's not a fan of killing the dragons the Viking's world so revolves around in. But, when Hiccup captures the rare Night Fury Dragon and inadvertently injures it, the two become fast friends and attempt to bridge the gap of understanding between the Dragons & the Vikings. It may not sound like much, but things are deeper than they may seem here, and they are 3 reasons you need to go out and watch this movie right now.<br /><br />1: Casting: Having seen Jay Baruchel as a geeky character in the film Fanboys, this film only solidifies for me the fact that Baruchel makes cliched characters feel real & brings traits out they wouldn't have otherwise, and this fact is very evident here. The same is true for the rest of the cast. In Shrek 2, Larry King was wasted in a long-running and painful transvestite joke. Here, Craig Ferguson is perfect in the role not only because he's Scottish, but he brings the appropriate mix of eccentric leadership needed for the right-hand man of Gerard Butler's character, who is also well cast. The same goes for the rest of the cast with the possible exception of Jonah Hill, who always feels out of place in almost every movie he's in.<br /><br />2: Visual Effects & 3D: Now this may because the Viking environment hasn't been portrayed much on screen before, but the film is stunningly beautiful, and that's only reinforced by the 3D which is used better than Avatar in some cases, especially in the case of the flying sequences.<br /><br />3: The Emotion/Uniqueness of the Film in Animation Today: The story gives way to many emotional moments in the film, all of which are played perfectly. And, not to give too much away, but at the end of the film something happens the to main character that was not only shocking to me, since I'd never seen something of its magnitude done in animation period, but to me it was also one of the most tear-jerking moments, especially in relation to what it does to the relationships & similarities between Hiccup & his dragon in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, how do you train your dragon? With charm, love, understanding, amazing visuals & stunning 3-D flying sequences. This film ranks up there with Pixar's best, and if I had any criticism towards the movie, it would be the fact that it's made by Dreamworks, and with their quality lately, you don't have high expectation entering this film. Nevertheless, How to Train Your Dragon gets a fire-breathing 5 out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda were both very close to Pixar level in terms of storytelling, but How to Train Your Dragon is the best by far from Dreamworks. The animation is very high in detail, especially in IMAX 3-D, and the characters are not only likeable, but memorable. The main dragon, Toothless, is one of the greatest animated characters in a long time, and like Wall-E, he doesn't even talk. All of the other species of dragons also have unique looks and personalities. The flying sequences here really show the power of 3-D as a tool to put the viewer in the movie, not just a gimmick. I would say it's second only to Avatar when viewed through those funny looking glasses.<br /><br />This film is more serious in tone than laugh out loud funny, much like the latest from Pixar (UP, Wall-E, etc.), but it does have quite a few laughs that come naturally, not forced. I'm so glad they stayed away from pop culture references. Both kids and parents will love How to Train Your Dragon equally and probably for much different reasons. The only thing that I didn't care for were the first 10 minutes or so. Not that they are bad in any way, but it felt a little rushed. Once the film settles and Hiccup (the boy viking) meets the dragon, everything begins to click. The only other negative is that every kid is going to want a pet dragon for their birthday. Good luck with that!<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Vikings are by all accounts burly, hairy, looming, and fierce, and that's probably just the womenfolk. Hiccup, the movie's sometime narrator, isn't your average tough and brawly Viking. Hiccup happens to be a hapless, noodly-figured, often scorned Viking teenager, and that his father is the intimidating village chief is maybe the sole reason why he isn't kicked more to the curb. Hiccup spends most of his days trying to prove himself to the warrior community. He only keeps on embarrassing himself. He's often relegated to the smithy, indoors and safe as the blacksmith's lowly apprentice.<br /><br />Hiccup's village sits on a desolate island, and it's a bleak living, made even more arduous by frequent encroachments of ravaging, fire-breathing dragons. Hundreds of years have seen these battle-craving Vikings hunting down these dragons, and Hiccup is expected to step into this manly habit. Except that Hiccup, an outsider and more introspective than most, will sort of accidentally topsy turvy that age-old tradition. But that's only if he makes it thru dragon slaying school. And if he survives his efforts to befriend the elusive Night Fury dragon.<br /><br />DreamWorks Animation still lags behind Pixar, but HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON goes a ways in garnering street cred for DreamWorks. It's real easy to get behind the story, its themes and philosophies, and the likable central character. The best things - or, rather, my favorite bits - about this film all have to do with Hiccup hanging out with his dragon and incidentally picking up invaluable insights in dealing with dragons. Toothless the Night Fury dragon is awesome and wonderfully expressive. Whenever Toothless springs into action, the film pulses with an exhilarating sense of adventure. These moments are when we're reminded that Toothless may be adorable but he's still very much a formidable presence. The message of tolerance and open-mindedness is naturally integrated into the story, so thankfully this doesn't at all feel like one of those very special Blossom episodes.<br /><br />The animation is really excellent, with the CG artists opting for more playful, more exaggerated renditions of the human characters and the dragons. The most realistically rendered elements turn out to be the atmospheric land-, sea-, and skyscapes. The dragon flights in this film are as breathtaking as those we saw in AVATAR. It makes me wish I'd seen this in 3D. I don't know why these Vikings have burry Scottish accents, but it does give us a chance to listen to the always funny Craig Ferguson (Gobber), so it's all good. Gerard Butler, who plays Hiccup's bullish father, channels his roaring persona from 300.<br /><br />So I've got the 2-DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and the following bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio commentary with Filmmakers Chris Sanders, Dean DeBlois, and Bonnie Arnold<br /><br />- "Viking-Sized Cast" has interviews with the voice actors (00:11:44 minutes long)<br /><br />- "The Technical Artistry of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON" - a focus on the film's state-of-the-art CG technology (00:10:13)<br /><br />- "Get Your Game On" previews the HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and KUNG FU PANDA WORLD video games<br /><br />- Trailers to SHREK FOREVER AFTER, THE PENGUINS OF MADAGASCAR, THE LAST AIRBENDER, and the upcoming MEGAMIND<br /><br />- The trailer to and a Behind the Scenes segment on SHREK THE MUSICAL<br /><br />The second DVD offers the fun animated short, LEGEND OF THE BONEKNAPPER DRAGON. It runs at around 16 minutes long. Taking place some time after the events in the film, this one tells of how the blacksmith Gobber, Hiccup and his young Viking friends embark on a quest across the icy seas for the mythical Boneknapper dragon. But they end up stranded on a barren rock formation. This short also features moments of old school 2D animation (whenever Gobber is flashing back to one of his rather far-fetched stories). My biggest beef with this short: Toothless is barely in this one.<br /><br />Bonus material for this second DVD:<br /><br />- 3 Deleted Scenes from the feature film, done in rough storyboard sketches, with intros from Director/Co-Writer Dean DeBlois (total running time: 00:07:34 minutes)<br /><br />- "The Story Behind the Story" presents an interview with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON author Cressida Cowell (00:07:40 minutes)<br /><br />- ""Racing for the Gold" is a fun, quick, animated peek into four categories within the Viking Winter Games (bobsledding, speed skating, ski jumping, and snowboarding) and also the medal ceremony for that greatest of Viking sports, Dragon Training (the top medal is made out of ham)<br /><br />- Animator Gabe Hordos instructs on "How to Draw Toothless" (00:10:57)<br /><br />- "Take the Viking Personality Test" - Take a multiple-choice survey to learn which of the characters in the film you're most like<br /><br />- "DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox" allows you to click on songs from previous DreamWorks animated flicks: "I'm a Believer" (SHREK), "I Like To Move It, Move It" (MADAGASCAR), "Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting" (KUNG FU PANDA), "Rockin' the Suburbs" (OVER THE HEDGE), and "Here Comes the Sun" (BEE MOVIE)<br /><br />- "Dragon Activity Center" - Insert this DVD into your PC and access the following DVD-ROM activities: "Build Your Own Dragons" (construct a life-size Toothless, a 3D Gronckle, a 3D Terrible Terror, and a 3D Night Fury) and "Viking Zone" (a peek at Viking Accessories, Viking & Dragon Masks, Flashlight Patterns, Growth Chart, Coloring Pages, and Stickers)</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"How to Train Your Dragon" is a fantasy adventure film from DreamWorks Animation. Unlike hilarious "Shrek" (I'm talking about the first one), the company's new computer animated film does not rearrange or subvert the genre's conventions much. Instead, with the straightforward narrative suitable for the material, "How to Train Your Dragon" tells a good story in a compelling way; in short, thrilling actions, likable characters and great animation.<br /><br />Set in the Viking village of Berk, the story begins with a young boy Hiccup (voice by Jay Baruchel, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"), who wants to be a real warrior, despite his obvious lack of skills, if not courage. One night, during the dragons' attacks on his village, Hiccup sets out to fight on his own with a weapon of his own making though his father and village leader Stoick (Gerard Butler) orders him to stay inside. Hiccup's reckless action results in the friendship between him and a wounded dragon the Night Fury or "Toothless."<br /><br />The story takes an unexpected turn when Hiccup realizes that dragons "have to" raid the village. The film is orthodox in its storytelling - a son who wants to impress his father, a feisty girl who wants to prove herself, rivalry and romance between them, etc. - but with the well-drawn characters you relate to, the film is never boring. Also, the film's exciting aerial sequences should not be missed.<br /><br />"How to Train Your Dragon" is directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, a team known for their joyful Disney animation film "Lilo & Stitch." The film adaptation of "How to Train Your Dragon" is exactly what you expect from the creators of those two lovable characters. Enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"How to Train Your Dragon" is a fun animated Dreamwork's flick to just sit back and enjoy.  It is based on the book by Cressida Cowell and the hero is shy "Hiccup"  (Full name is Hiccup Horrendus Haddock III).  He is the skinny 13 year old son of a big and mighty Viking leader.  As part of Viking culture he must kill a dragon to prove he has warrior qualities and will be able to succeed his hero father in the Viking kingdom.  After Hiccup downs a dragon beast, he finds he cannot kill it.  He names it toothless and they become buddies as they help each other out.  The story shows how the kingdom has dragons of every ilk and many of them to boot!  It keeps you interested as the tide of opinion turns and a fantastic ending.  The only criticism I have is that the Vikings seem to have a Scottish accent instead of Nordic, and Hiccup's is just as American as can be.  That does not take away from the movie but older viewers may notice.  A nice adventure for the kids.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this is a great movie i love this movie and i love the characters. i wish i had a pet dragon like toothless that would be cool. and the boneknapper movie is awesome to. i love these movies. great for all ages</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>I wasn't very engrossed by the first twenty minutes or so, but then it seemed to really gel and I loved the rest. The animation is typically fine Dreamworks stuff, though I wish I'd seen this in 3D in theaters, as many shots are clearly set up to highlight those effects, and while they look fine in 2D, it's clear that we're missing another semi-dimension. But that's no big deal, as the film is in general quite winning.<br /><br />The voice work is all good, with Gerard Butler the most convincing. I really liked Toothless' look, and the highlight of the film is the boy-and-his-dragon aspect; it's always kind of funny when animation makes you tear up a bit. But anyone who's ever really loved an animal friend knows how that goes.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is quite good, though not quite as amazingly crisp as Up or Kung Fu Panda. There are a few extras, a brief doc on the voices, but it's not an especially great BD package, merely decent.<br /><br />All in all, a very good-looking, heartfelt movie, one of the best animated films of 2010 that I've seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A visually arresting 3D animated adventure about a young man who has grown up as a bit of a misfit in a Viking village. He has a strained relationship with his Father, the tribe's chief, because of his lack of physical gifts. During the course of the film, he encounters the most feared dragon species, befriending the creature. The film is engaging, funny, exciting, and the animation is top notch. This is an outstanding piece of work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This is a graphics feast for your eyes. There is a lot of breath taking wide shots of meticulously created seaside and mountain top scenes. It takes you on a virtual ride on the back of a dragon and the film is a thrill ride in more ways than one.<br /><br />The story centers around a youth called Hiccup (Jay Baruchel also of Sorcerer's Apprentice) who is an under-achiever as far as the ways of the Vikings go. Unlike his father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler also of The Ugly Truth) who is a much accomplished fighter and dragon killer, Hiccup is more of a brains than brawn type of guy.<br /><br />With his technical skills his is able to construct a device that is able to capture the mysterious Night Fury dragon (that no-one have ever been able to capture or kill). However, the device damages the dragon's tail, and he is no longer able to fly properly. Hiccup soon constructs an artificial tail piece for the dragon, and then he also makes a harness for the dragon and learns to ride it.<br /><br />Each time he goes for a ride on the dragon, it is like a surreal adventure in the skies. The adventure element of this film is pretty high, but there is also a lot of action sequences as the story develops.<br /><br />The voice acting is superb, and Jay's voice of uncertainty/frustration adds depth to his character and conveys his odd situations quite well, Gerard also does a very good job.<br /><br />The underlying message of this movie is not to judge anyone too quickly without knowing the full circumstances under which they are making their decisions.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Hiccup's got a good heart and a bright mind, and likes to try new things.  Unfortunately none of those traits are in demand among the Vikings ... and, as it turns out, he's a young Viking.  They pride themselves on brawn, rather than brain.  They value the ruthless and courageous, the dragon killers, rather than the clever and kind and empathetic.  Of course, since he's the star of the movie, we know he's going to show that what he has is what they need, and that he'll save his village and prove himself to his father along the way.  It's the same tried and true formula that has formed the emotional core of so many animated films, about an out-of-place young person who proves himself to his people and his parent(s) by being completely different from them and doing just what they would never do.  It's what made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A345E4">Rudolph's</a> nose bright, what made Remy's nose sensitive (in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBJEEG">Ratatouille</a>), and what made Flik so clever (in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LVCM">A Bug's Life</a>).  What keeps folks following the formula is that it works.  We all root for the under-appreciated underdog, because, at bottom, we all think we are one, but what we really want for the outsider is that he or she (and we) be accepted by the insiders.  The formula, though, feels fresh enough here to work quite well.<br /><br />With this film and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECQ75A">Kung Fu Panda</a>, it seems the Dreamworks folks have finally learned that the the easy laughs that come with the endless pop cultural references (of shows like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006JMLRK">Shark Tale</a>) just make a movie seem stale on a second or third viewing.  While that one was amusing enough the first time in theaters, by the time it came out on dvd it just felt lame.  Kung Fu Panda, though, feels fresh after a few viewings, and I'm certain this one will too.  The range of personalities among the Vikings makes them all consistently interesting, the dragons, especially in flight, are delightfully rendered; there are moments of awe and there are slow moments where you can really connect with the characters.  While I wouldn't consider this a flawless film - the final showdown and the final revelations about the dragons that came with it seemed a bit too easy and contrived - it is nevertheless a beautifully animated and very enjoyable film.  My kids loved it, and I liked it a lot.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>I fell madly in love with this movie the first time my sister-in-law insisted I see it.  As a person who has read Cressida Cowell's series, I will be the first to admit this has not a single thing to do with its source book, but wow, this is an animated movie of heart among animated movies.  It's wonderfully simple while still boasting plenty of emotion. It's funny.  It's snappy.  The animation and music are gorgeous.  And hey, who doesn't love dragons?<br /><br />The story is of a Viking boy named Hiccup who is the worst Viking of his tribe. He's shrimpy, too smart-alecky for his own good, and he happens to be the over-protected son of the chief.  The tribe has been waging a centuries-old war with the dragons who prey on the same food suppy, so Hiccup believes that if he kills a dragon he will finally earn some respect.  So he invents a machine to shoot down a dragon, accomplishes the conceptual goal, and sets about killing it.  Only he is unable to.  Instead, he winds up making a pet out of the dragon he names Toothless.<br /><br />This movie is, by all definitions, adorable.  The kids will love the cute dragons, the teen set will love the hint of teen romance and all the action, and as an adult I was intrigued by both the relationships in the movie as well as the pure movie-making art.  Truly, there is something for everyone.<br /><br />The blu-ray/dvd is standard and suitable blu-ray/dvd entertainment, though it seemed most of the good stuff was added to the blu-ray, leaving the dvd itself with very little.  Still, we get the commentary (I love commentary), a pop-up fact track (lots of fun), deleted scenes (always interesting) as well as a fun little Viking personality quiz.  Not to mention the short movie, which I found quite enjoyable.  Nothing terribly special, but certainly worthy.<br /><br />Still, the reason to buy anything is the movie itself.  It's enchanting.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>There's so much to like about this that I'm not even sure where to start. First, the animation: Superb, as always, and things like hair and fur just get better at every turn of technology. Second, the plot: inept boy makes good despite the wrong-headed grownups, and the cute girl likes him in the end (as does everyone else).  Third, the misfits who just happen to fit together very well. You'll find out about that when you see it. Like a great chef making wonderful pastry from ordinary ingredients, Dreamworks cooks up these common elements into a delectable treat.<br /><br />So much for the big things, which all come together well. The little things really make this movie. For instance, there's the grizzled old wardog explaining that he lost his leg to a dragon because he's delicious, but that's just one moment in the ongoing banter. The fearsomely capable girl is good too, even if that role has become a commonplace. She'd whomp our hero at any known skill, so he comes out ahead using unknown skills. The awkwardness between dad and teen son has warmth enough, in a way that might bring the viewer's own past awkwardness back to life for just a moment. The dragons have as much personality as the humans, if not more, together with a few charming feline traits. And the hat ... again, you'll have to see that one for yourself.<br /><br />Art, story, characters: it all comes together in a great family entertainment. I'll see this one again.<br /><br />- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I am really surprised that HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON did not do better in the theatres.  My husband, 13 and 5 year old daughters, and I selected this movie for family movie night a few weeks ago, and we all liked it very much.  HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is a sweet, adorable movie, beautifully rendered, with a kind-hearted messages.<br /><br />DreamWorks really did a nice job with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.  In HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, we meet Hiccup, the son of a Viking chief.  Hiccup is, well, different that the other Viking kids; he is skinny, smart, and not particularly interesting in killing things.  Unfortunately, their village is constantly under attack by dragons, and all children must learn to become dragon hunters.  Hiccup does try to kill dragons, but he always fails, often times making things worse for his village.  Finally, through a stroke of pure luck, Hiccup manages to bring down a dreaded Night Fury dragon; but, of course, no one sees it happen.  Not even his father believes his story.  Tenderhearted Hiccup cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, who he names Toothless.  Instead the two bond and form a fast friendship, Hiccup learns how to tame dragons without killing them, and in the end, saves his village and his people from an even worse threat.<br /><br />The plot of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is story we have all heard before, countless times, but, quite frankly, we didn't care at all.  The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are quite talented, and the tale is very charmingly told.  My 5 year old loved it (and wants repeated viewings), the 13 year old declared it okay (which at this age is EXTREMELY high praise), and my husband and I enjoyed ourselves.  The messages are clear and kid appropriate:  1. Don't do things just because they've always been done that way.  2.  Think for yourself.  3.  Get to know your enemy.  If you can't remember why you are fighting, it might be time to stop.<br /><br />HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is good family entertainment, perfect for a quiet evening at home.  My kids now want pet dragons.  Hmm...  I wonder if I can fit 2 dragons in the backyard...</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>Hiccup is a Viking ahead of his time. He is able to look at his own society much as an outsider would view it (Similar to "Eric, the Viking"). The village is besieged by dragons, but such is life for a Viking. Hiccup, as an intellectual Viking creates a weapon that is able to injure the infamous Night Fury Dragon, one that has never been seen by his people. Hiccup tracks the injured dragon on his own, however is unable to slaughter it when it lays defenseless trapped in ropes from his own weapon. Rather he cuts the dragon loose. They become friends as he brings it food. Hiccup splits his time caring from the dragon he names Toothless, and attending dragon school. He learns secrets by about dragons by caring for one. He applies what he has learned to dragon school, much to the amazement of his fellow students and instructors, becoming a child hero and legend. There is a young blond Viking lass he wants to impress. The plot is predictable and the movie is wonderful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>Dreamworks comes up big with How To Train Your Dragon. It is a very simple to follow story about a boy who's father is of major importance in the time of Vikings. Yet Hiccup does not inherit the strong burly momentum that his father does. So instead of going up against his tribes enemies, the dragons he is sent to work as the lowest of the low in the fight, until he decided to accidentially trap one of the rarest of the rare. When his father finds out he did he is proclaimed a hero and when he finds his catch he tries to do something none of his tribe has ever done...learn to befriend it and understand it. What Hiccup uncovers is a major secret in the world of Dragons and that there is a way to put a stop to years and years of rivalry.<br /><br />This movie will make you laugh and make you feel true emotions as it portrays a classic Father Son tale. The cast is amazing from the leading role played by Jay Barruchel all the way to Craig Ferrgeson. Dreamworks, while they don't always create a gem like Pixar tends to do, comes up strong with this one. It is a great movie and you will definitely enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>The viking genre is a perennial one in Hollywood, with about one major release per year.  Previous releases include Beowulf, Pathfinder, The 13th Warrior among others.  All these previous movies shared one result; bad reviews.  Now Dreamworks takes a stab at the genre with an animated comedy, and scores one of the biggest hits of 2010; How to Train Your Dragon.  Unlike Shrek, Over the Hedge, Antz and Dreamwork's previous animated films, this one focuses primarily on human characters and their relationships, with only one key non-human involved, the dragon Toothless.  And interestingly, Toothless does not talk, which is rare in animated films.  Yet the combination works out.  The movie is funny, the storyline is extremely original, and the characters have depth and create empathy among the audience.  Most of the comedy is either slapstick action comedy involving the dragons, or humorous dialogue between the viking characters; all of which is appropriate for even the youngest children.<br /><br />I consider this one of the best movies of 2010.  This would have been the best animated film of 2010 if Toy Story 3 was not around.  But since both films came out this year, we might see 2 animated nominations for the Best Picture at the Academy Awards come February.  Both the Blu-Ray and regular DVD come with an additional short film featuring most of the main, human characters from the main movie.  This short film is quite entertaining, though it is pure comedy and lacks some of the heart of the feature film.  There are no additional scenes in the movie, just the standard features that come with a DVD, such as interviews with cast members, and a history of the effort it took to go from book to film.  Overall, worth the time to watch it, and the money to buy this set.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>How to Train Your Dragon is simply superb. It's a wonderfully heart-warming and beautifully animated film that's not only fun for kids, but also for adults. Of course, kids will love the big smashy Vikings and dragons, but for parents, grown-up kids and animation fans, there's plenty of other things to love: a kooky cast of characters, some witty and sarcastic dialog, and the lush and lovingly-rendered CG visuals. Dreamworks grows by leaps and bounds with each successive film in terms of animation technology, and this is their best work yet, looking even better than the fantastic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168OINK">Kung Fu Panda [Blu-ray</a>]. But besides that, it's got an entertaining story that audiences of all ages can appreciate.<br /><br />This is the story of a scrawny, wimpy boy named Hiccup, who lives in the village of Berk. The film begins with him introducing us to his miserable island "twelve days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death" and its pest problem-- dragons! Here's where the dragons come in and the scene quickly changes to one of comic chaos. As the Vikings run around fending off the fire-breathing raiders, Hiccup is told by everyone to get out of the way and get back inside. He desperately wants to impress the people of his village and earn their respect, especially his father, Stoick the Vast, the leader of their tribe and a brave Viking, who sees his son as a nuisance at best and a disappointment. During the raid, he makes a mess trying to help, but not without shooting down a rare and mysterious Night Fury first (the fiercest of them all). Problem is, no one believes him because he's such a bungler.<br /><br />Afterwards, Hiccup sneaks off to the woods to find the injured dragon with the intent of finishing the job and proving his Vikingness. He is unable to and over time, he befriends the dragon, who he names Toothless. He uses his blacksmithing skills to create a tail fin for his injured buddy and through Toothless, he learns a lot about taming and training dragons (hence the film's title). Hiccup eventually becomes proud of who he is and earns the respect of all his friends and villagers. At the end, we are treated to a spectacular fight in gorgeous 3D CG and he returns home a hero. Everyone is happy. Village is safe, father-son issues resolved, boy gets girl.<br /><br />It's all very wholesome entertainment with a good, positive story for kids and adults. Amusingly, the Viking characters all have Scottish accents, which is a stroke of genius. Many of the funnier, sarcastic lines are delivered by Gobbler (voiced by comedian Craig Ferguson), the one armed, one legged blacksmith, Stoick's 2nd in command, and Hiccup's mentor. Stoick himself is voiced by Gerard Butler (another Scot), who has played a Norse warrior before in the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UYX4OK">Beowulf & Grendel [Blu-ray</a>]. Stoick's animated mannerisms and gestures are perfectly captured! They look exactly like Butler's movements and facial expressions from other films and the animators did an excellent job bringing all the nuances to life onscreen. Ferguson and Butler's voices add a lot of personality to the film. The only thing I found annoying was Hiccup's voice (Jay Baruchel), who speaks in a nasal monotone and self-deprecating deadpan most of the time. I also didn't care for any of the other kid characters in the film. They are dull and forgettable, without really any memorable lines, funny moments, or interesting accents to set them apart.<br /><br />The sets, camerawork and lush detailing of all the characters, props, environments, and dragons is top-notch and it's clear a lot of love and attention went into making this film. The Nordic ship designs, for example, are particularly well done. How To Train Your Dragon is a fun movie and well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"How to Train Your Dragon" -- I saw this animated film on an Imax screen in 3D, and it was a delightful experience. The setting is a Viking village where the men are big, brawny, husky warriors, and the wives are pretty imposing as well. The village is besieged by dragons in all sizes, shapes and colors who swoop down and take away livestock and anything else edible. Hiccup is a nerdy kid whose father does not have faith in him as a dragon-slayer. The kid does bring down a dragon, but no one believes him.<br /> He goes hunting for the downed dragon and finds that he has only wounded it, shot off one of its tail fins so it is unable to fly. The kid miraculously befriends the dragon, and clever boy that he is makes a new rudder-operated tailfin for the dragon. The boy learns that dragons are basically friendly, and they can be tamed and made into pets.<br /> The scenes where the boy on his home-made saddle goes soaring through the air on the back of the dragon are worthy of scenes in "Avatar." He wins over a girlfriend by showing her his prowess with dragons. The boy is clever, resourceful, a good artist, and compassionate.<br /> Most animated films made primarily for children have worthy lessons to impart which are embedded in the story. They don't preach but they do teach. Hiccup's super-macho father comes to admire and respect the boy's skills, and they are brought closer together.<br /> The movie is a mixture of daredevil action sequences, comedy, pathos, and the need for empathy between man and natural creatures. Kids, I think, will learn a lot about Viking ships, costumes, customs, food, and the world of the early Norse society where men were men, and the women were hefty too.<br /> The movie becomes somewhat cutesy in the old Disney style when the dragon becomes endearing and coy. I highly recommend this movie for all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>This film endeared itself to me from the moment I heard the name of the young hero - Hiccup! Yes, apparently, in Viking lore, the more unpleasant one's name, the greater the chances of avoiding trolls and all manner of unpleasantness. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a young Viking lad, who lives in an isolated Viking village far from the rest of civilization, and where most of the population is engaged in defending their village from marauding dragons of all kinds. Hiccup feels he is a disappointment to his father, Viking leader Stoick (voiced by Scotsman Gerard Butler) whose sole purpose in life is to kill dragons. Hiccup initially believes the way to his father's heart and that of a comely Viking lass, Astrid (America Ferrara), is to prove himself by killing a dragon. Since he possesses a small build, his only hope of killing a dragon is through ingenious means, and Hiccup invents a contraption that elicits derision from others, but one night, during a fierce dragon attack, Hiccup actually manages to catch a dragon. Unfortunately for Hiccup, the dragon disappears into the forest and no one believes him.<br /><br />Later, Hiccup who has already been labeled a hopeless case by his peers and fellow villagers is compelled to enter dragon-fighting training - with fellow trainees Astrid, Fishlegs (Christopher Mintze-Plasse), Snotlout (Jonah Hill), and twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut (Kristen Wiig and T.J. MIller). This is also the time Hiccup discovers the missing dragon, which turns out to be of the Night Fury variety of dragon - so swift that never has one been captured and nothing is known of it.<br /><br />The story moves along at a suitable pace and never lags - nor is it paced too fast. The story is allowed to develop as well as the characters- especially of the dragon "Toothless" and the boy Hiccup. The evolving relationship between dragon and boy is one of the sweetest highlights of the movie. The viewer gets to witness the slow progression from mistrust and suspicion (on the part of the dragon) and fear (on Hiccup's side) to gradual friendship, trust, and a deep, abiding sense of loyalty. The dragons featured in this film do not speak, which to me is a bonus - they convey their emotions through their eyes (and boy, does Toothless have a pair of expressive ones) and actions.<br /><br />The dragons are a joy to watch - there are all sorts of varieties, from the clumsy, stocky ones to the long-necked, elegant ones, and truly ferocious, mean-looking ones. The twist halfway through the story kept the plot interesting and fresh. There's also a startling twist towards the end that challenges the traditional manner of approaching kid's movies (to say more would constitute a spoiler).<br /><br />The humor is pitched at an appropriate level - kids will get most of it, and adults will find some amusing bits as well, though this is very much a kids' movie (no pop culture references here) and a movie for the kids in all of us. I loved the messages conveyed in this movie - that it's okay to be different, in fact marching to the beat of a different drum (as portrayed by Hiccup's character) is something desirable and not to be mocked at or belittled. The movie also provides educational insights - Hiccup's methods in gaining Toothless' trust and obedience is reminiscent of how humans train dogs/horses, and his various experiments in determining what repels dragons will encourage inquiry thinking in young children (great discussion point for parents and children here).<br />The concept of hands-on learning is prevalent throughout the movie. The themes of friendship, loyalty, and communication between parent and child are also strongly emphasized to good effect.<br /><br />The effects are amazing - watching dragons in flight, especially in 3-D is pure poetry and the battle scenes are well done, without going over the top on the violent bits. The movie is rated PG for sequences of intense action and some scary scenes, and brief mild language. I did not find anything in this movie which was offensive, and we (husband and I) took our 5-year-old to watch it - all three of us enjoyed it immensely. The movie runs about 98 minutes. Final verdict - fun and wonderful entertainment for the entire family, and certainly worth splurging on the 3-D.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>This movie is great fun.  They manage to keep even the scary moments kind of "cute" so it is not too much for young children.  I really enjoyed it and so did my children.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>In the tradition of some of our better animated films, "How to Train Your Dragon" establishes a thoroughly engaging friendship between a boy and an animal -- so engaging that we do in fact hurt when it appears that one or both is in grave danger. Animated films have always had that kind of power over audiences, maybe because an animal gives the filmmaker the perfect opportunity to convey emotions at their most fundamental. When they're happy, they're completely happy. When they're sad, they're completely sad. When they suffer, they express themselves so clearly that we suffer right along with them. It matters not that, in this case, the animal is a dragon, which doesn't exist; in the world of an animated film, entertainment tends to take precedence over reality.<br /><br />The boy is a Viking teenager named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), an outcast amongst his people for being too short, too skinny, too clumsy, and too nonviolent in a village where dragon slaying is practically a religion. He thinks he wants nothing more than to be a mighty warrior, and for a good portion of time, he tries to get by in training, in which he's pitted against caged dragons in an arena of sorts. But after injuring and ensnaring a dragon all on his own -- an elusive and (supposedly) lethal kind, classified as Night Fury -- he finds he doesn't have the heart to kill it. He then befriends it, humorously dubbing it Toothless, and quickly realizes that his people have it all wrong: Dragons are not evil beasts that must be destroyed, but merely frightened creatures who are provoked into violence.<br /><br />Toothless, who hides in a clearing beyond a waterfall, is large, graceful, majestic, and ever so slightly cute. This is good, not only for the children in the audience, but also because we need to care for him just as much as Hiccup does. And speaking of Hiccup, he's now faced with the task of leading a double life. To everyone else, including his crotchety trainer Gobber the Belch (voiced by Craig Ferguson), he seems to have transformed himself from a village disgrace into one of the best dragon fighters the people have ever seen. This doesn't sit too well with the tough, athletic, determined Astrid (voiced by America Ferrera), Hiccup's secret crush; she becomes increasingly suspicious of him, especially since his methods of subduing the dragons are not exactly what one would call violent.<br /><br />Matters are further complicated by Hiccup's father, the brawny Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler), who up until now has always been disappointed in his son. Unfortunately, he has become proud for all the wrong reasons. He has yet to find out about Toothless, and he still doesn't understand that Hiccup has absolutely no intention of ever killing a dragon in battle. It's a classic case of the reluctant parent struggling to understand his child, of never listening to the child when he's trying to say something he feels is important.<br /><br />Indeed, the general plot is a classic case, relying on themes of friendship, acceptance, and courage to get its point across. But what this movie lacks in original ideas it more than makes up for in heart, humor, and sheer visual spectacle, made stronger by its presentation in 3-D. Some of the film's most impressive scenes involve Hiccup riding on Toothless' back as he soars triumphantly above clouds, through craggy peaks, and over the sea; they're not merely stunning examples of camerawork and computer imagery, they're also exhilarating. And yes, there are a number of frenetic battle scenes, especially in the latter half of the film, at which point the Vikings are pitted against a monstrosity the likes of which no one has ever seen.<br /><br />All this is in good fun. But for my money, the strongest element of "How to Train Your Dragon" was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless, who against all odds became the best of friends. There is nothing here we haven't seen before, but can you honestly say you weren't touched at some level? The moment when Toothless is finally trusting enough to butt his head against Hiccup's hand made my heart glad. Maybe I'm too sentimental, but there you have it. There are also some genuinely funny moments involving Hiccup's attempts to feed Toothless, one of them ending in a less than appetizing way.<br /><br />One could easily fault the minor details. Could any Viking, however muscular and well armed, physically defeat a gigantic winged reptile capable of breathing fire? Could anyone keep a large, noisy dragon a secret for as long as Hiccup did? Would no one have discovered the secret dragon nest long ago? If you think these questions are worth asking, you'd probably be better off seeing a different movie. "How to Train Your Dragon," adapted from Cressida Cowell's book, is terrific family entertainment -- fun, heartfelt, and a pleasure to look at. Its greatest achievement is its ability to resonate emotionally, something all stories about unlikely friendships need in order to work. Without it, you'd have nothing more than a mindless action piece, with plenty to see but little to identify with.</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>Craig Ferguson's voice is a perfect natural for this 2010 release Viking based, animation film, "How To Train Your Dragon."  Yes you need to bring your imagination and let go of being too much of an adult as you view this 2010 release.  Dreamworks gets a big kudos from me for their efforts sharing the epic story of Hiccup (Viking young lad) befriending a dangerously lethal, special forces dragon he names "Toothless" (retractable teeth).<br /><br />We all have a sentimental romantic concept of what and who the Vikings were back there in the Dark Ages from 800 A.D. to 1000 A.D. with their two handed battle axes that could split armor and shields with ease, arriving by longboats in or around regions such as Constantinople, Iceland, Russia, Greenland, Newfoundland, Ireland, Britain and other parts of Europe known as Scandinavian (Norse) savages, explorers, warriors, merchants, and pirates, and one of my favorite depictions of those rough hewn enduring epic folklore people was brought to the screen in a 2005 film named "Beowulf & Grendel" starring (pay attention) Stellan Skarsgard, Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson, Gunnar Eyjolfsson, Philip Whitchurch, Ronan Vibert, Rory McCann, Hring ur Ingvarsson, Elva Osk Olafsdottir, Olafur Darri Olafsson, Steinunn Olina Persteinsdottir, (I'm not kidding) and one other name that helped make this earlier epic saga film authentic and believable, which of course was the outstanding actor Gerard Butler.<br /><br />Well, heed my warning about that 2005 version of "Beowulf & Grendel" being not for the squeamish or easily-given-nightmares type viewer.  THAT film isn't animation, it uses real people, with real places, and realistic terror.  Although not as terrifying as the 1999 release of "The 13th Warrior" with Antonio Banderas (also an epic saga about Vikings), "Beowulf & Grendel" (2005 release with Gerard Butler) still has its moments.<br /><br />On the other hand, "How To Train Your Dragon" is animated.  Therefore it by default isn't intended to be as frightening to the point of heart stopping dread and intrepidation.  It still can be pretty scary at times though for any child under 10 years of age.  The ancient dragon king that comes out of the abyss can be interpreted by impressionable minds as equivalent to the devil out of hell (which is terrifying for the deeply religious).  I'm just giving you a heads up for that potential, I'm not saying it was intentional by the makers of "How To Train Your Dragon."<br /><br />Gerard Butler is the voice of a main character (the dad) in this 2010 animated film, and has obviously studied the Viking culture.  Whereas I will readily agree you can't help but fall in love with the dragon dubbed "Toothless" I also have to add my perspective that it isn't only the weak, frail, timid, and outcast kid (who fails at almost everything else) who can and does have wisdom and empathy enough to consider sentient life worth respect and having a charitable "live and let live" objectivity as a good way of discovering that everybody else's enemy isn't necessarily your enemy too.  But putting aside the idea that a fierce, deadly, gruesome "night fury" dragon can be trusted unconditionally to love a helpless boy enough to team up with an otherwise useless failure personality and become heroes (which has a spectrum of connotations that almost gave me an aneurysm), if you can overlook how a father who disowns his son and gives up on mentoring him to be equipped for survival and acceptance among his own people, then later on after the son does the most rebellious, against-the-grain thing imaginable, the dad tells him how he's proud of him, well then if you can overlook those details, then yes this is a good movie.<br /><br />The point I'm trying to make is you can over analyze anything.  This movie is supposed to be an escape from reality, softening and conquering what frightens us, overcoming brutal ignorance from those who would barricade our dreams, and making friends out of otherwise potentially deadly enemies.  Come away with Hiccup to an island called Berk, where he wins the heart of his overly macho village champion father by making friends with a few of the dragon creatures who make a habit of destroying their homes and food supplies, and maim their fellow villagers who manage to survive.  Try to forget the psychological impetus possibilities off on whatever tangent, and just enjoy the awesome depiction of camaraderie that you don't have in your own reality.  It is a cartoon for crying out loud.  Let go of logic, and step into fantasy.  You know, like believing your boss knows how valuable you are on your real life job.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, fun, and I wish I had a dragon friend like "Toothless."  Buy this DVD movie and enjoy it over and over with the family (except kids under 10 who might have nightmares).  Bravo Dreamworks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"How To Train Your Dragon" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: A Viking teenager named Hiccup lives on the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. The teen's smarts and offbeat sense of humor don't sit too well with his tribe or its chief... who just happens to be Hiccup's father. However, when Hiccup is included in Dragon Training with the other Viking teens, he sees his chance to prove he has what it takes to be a fighter. But when he encounters (and ultimately befriends) an injured dragon, his world is flipped upside down, and what started out as Hiccup's one shot to prove himself turns into an opportunity to set a new course for the future of the entire tribe.<br /><br />The voice cast led by Jay Baruchel (as Hiccup) & Gerard Butler (as Stoick) is excellent!

Miller and Kristen Wiig<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: William Davies, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders; based on the novel by Cressida Cowell<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders<br /><br />Rated: PG<br />Genre: Animation / Fantasy<br />Release Date: 26 March 2010<br />Review Date: 27 May 2010<br /><br />It's amazing how far animation has come; literally milestones from where it originated. It allows us to go on adventures no real life characters or actual movie sets could take us to. There are virtually no limitations in its magical world and How to Train Your Dragon dabbles in this splendid availability relentlessly.<br /><br />There's a reason movies like this and Avatar and Alice in Wonderland are raking in all the profits of consumers; they are the most fun to see in theaters. While I still remain a loyal patron to an abundance of movie stars, the days of an actor's name alone, filling seats are long gone for the majority of moviegoers. They want to be dazzled visually more than anything; thus the recent big to-do over 3-D and IMAX presentations. Bigger, brighter, and louder has now become better.<br /><br />The animation style is something we haven't seen very much of. The characters are all generated to look slightly less perfect than we know they could. Big eyes, obscure heads and hairdos, and their personalities are all modernized while the film has them placed back in the Viking era.<br /><br />Our hero is a boy named Hiccup and is ideally voiced by Jay Baruchel. Hiccups Dad is a massive burly Viking played by Gerard Butler and Hiccup may never live up to his manly expectations. His dad slays dragons and expects the same from him, and Hiccup just doesn't have the ambition to do this.<br /><br />That is lessened even more, when he befriends a dragon in the forest. The two meet when no one is around and soon begin meeting in secret on a regularly basis. Of course the dragon has a wounded wing, and Hiccup tends to it and earns the beast's trust.<br /><br />But what else would you have happen between a boy and a dragon? The film does not disappoint in making their connection enduring and fun-filled as the two take to the skies and bring us along for the ride. If there was ever a film worth paying an extra five bucks to see in 3-D, it's this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>This film is a masterpiece in the "kidult" (kid/adult) movie category. All family will find something to love here - younger children will love the funny dragons and Vikings, teenagers will most probably be seduced by humour and music and the adults will certainly appreciate the most excellent dialogues and especially this incredible first date during which the main hero steals forever the heart of the girl who just one hour earlier furiously, insanely, visceraly and totally hated his guts!<br /><br />Without providing too many SPOILERS, I will try to describe the appeal of this film focusing on four points: the main hero, the First Contact with an alien intelligence, the PERFECT First Date and the PERFECTION of the scenario.<br /><br />1. The hero. From the first moments of the film it is simply impossible to not like, at least a little, a young boy named Hiccup the Useless (a.k.a Hiccup the Horrendous), son of Stoic the Vast, of the tribe of Hairy Hooligans, from the land of Berk...))) Living amongst possibly the proudest and fiercest tribe of all the Vikings, Hiccup has problems to fit in, as he has less muscles and natural born ferocity than his kinsmen.<br /><br />Having suffered from social isolation for most of his life, he developped a very sarcastic and bitter sense of humour, a solid complex of inferiority and a taste for staying away from others, in the safe haven of the workshop of the blacksmith Gobber, of whom he is the only apprentice.<br /><br />It would be however difficult to see him as a loser, as he spend most of his time since early childhood working very hard and also intensely studying - which made him into the chief tinkerer of the whole Viking village and a very promising future blacksmith. However, his love for extravagant contraptions put him in a lot of trouble many times and many Vikings of Berk consider him almost as a threat to the public safety...)))<br /><br />Now, the Vikings of Berk are tough customers, because since 300 years they wage a desperate war against the local dragons. The land of Berk is poor in natural resources and dragons try daily to steal every scrap of food they can find in Viking village - sheep, fish and even chicken are stolen at the first opportunity. Unwilling to starve, the Vikings developped weapons and tactics to fight the various dragons and until now managed to survive. But the fight is getting tougher and tougher and when the story begins the food supplies are running exceptionally low - and the long and cruel winter will be coming soon... In such hard times everybody is needed to fight to the best of his abilities and Hiccup is send finally into military training together with other youths of his age: Fishlegs, Snotlout, twins Tuffnut and Ruffnut and especially Astrid, the girl with whom he is hopelessly in love like since always - and who despises him openly and comes even to hate him passionately...<br /><br />Now, Hiccup, although being weaker and less bloodthirsty than other Vikings, is definitely not a peacenik. He certainly likes tinkering - but what he builds are war engines! He is also all in favour of waging the war - but as the story develops he will realise that it is crucial that his tribe starts waging the RIGHT KIND of war... And ultimately it will become clear that far from being a loser, he is in fact the greatest warrior of his tribe as he will face, defeat and slay the most powerful, terrifying and evil creature that his tribe has ever met! And there are some moments in the story, in which he displays a steel strong determination and he even can be a little bit ruthless... Combined with wits, humour, honor, courage and generous heart, all this makes him a very likeable and exceptionnal hero of a movie for kids... Small wonder that he finally manages to tame the (lovely and clever) shrew whom he loved from the first sight when they were both barely out of their diapers...<br /><br />2. The First Contact with an alien intelligence. Of all the dragons the Vikings of Berk ever faced, there is one, which even the most ferocious warriors fear - the Night Fury! Nobody ever saw the Night Fury and lived to tell the tale, so even after 300 years of war, nobody has any idea how this dragon looks like... But it exists, that much is certain and it is an absolutely deadly creature. The Night Fury is so fast, that it is impossible to see it clearly in the night sky (it comes out of its secret lair only after sunset) and it creates supersonic blasts when it accelerates! Also, its flame blast is exceptionally powerful - so hot, that it is white-blue and so fast, that it hits the target before even people on the ground realise that they are being shot at. And the Night Fury is also more clever than other dragons, always avoiding traps and always attacking in the weak spots of Viking defences. In one word, Night Fury is death.<br /><br />But because of his intelligence and courage (and also a little bit of luck) Hiccup will manage to see this particular dragon - and even better than just see... During the film the teenager and the deadly but intelligent alien creature will establish a truce, then an understanding, then an alliance - and finally a very deep and sincere friendship. This gradual process is shown with a breathtking perfection, a great intelligence and attention to details and tons of humour - and it is very, very touching...<br /><br />3. The PERFECT first date. I will not enter into details here, because it is important that you discover this great moment of cinema unspoiled, but this is one of the most beautiful scenes I saw in a film ever. I am now a married man and a father of two children (so not really a teenager anymore) but the PERFECT first date from this film very pleasantly reminded me of this time in life when the world seems to smile to us, when the sky is singing, when nothing else counts that this magic moment and when everything is good, pure, beautiful and exactly as it should be... Allow yourself to open your heart beginning with the scene in which Astrid beats Hiccup with her fists and the handle of her battleaxe (definitely a required thing for the PERFECT first date) and let yourself be seduced by the magic of everything that follows. Believe me, you will not regret it...<br /><br />4. The perfection of the scenario. The film makes a full circle and the ending of the story connects perfectly with its beginning (including a very clever use of words "pest" and "pet"). There is not even one moment of weakness. There is absolutely no one scene which could be deleted without harming the film and I can hardly imagine what else could have been added. The dialogues are simply perfect - full of wit and humour, they all have their importance. All characters are very well developped - other than Hiccup, Astrid and the Night Fury, those who are the most crucial are Stoic the Vast and Gobber. A good thing is that the film doesn't bash any characters - there is no "bad guys" amongst the Vikings and even when Stoic the Vast makes a huge mistake of judgment we can actually very well understand his reasons - and also there is no doubt that although pigheaded and very conservative, he is nevertheless a very brave and absolutely selfless man, entirely dedicated to the survival of his tribe. A very succesful character is Fishlegs, a somehow obese young Viking who clearly played too much "Dungeons and Dragons", as he knows all the dragon statistics by heart... As a long time ADD player myself I laughed out loud during all his nerdy comments and interventions...)))<br /><br />The story gets quite serious towards the end, by showing that the real evil (with capital E, V, I, L and an exclamation mark) can not be ignored, escaped or appeased - it must be faced, fought, defeated and mercilessly eraditcated. But when there is a fight there are casualties on both sides and there is no blodless victories - and so even the greatest triumph brings its part of grief, loss and sorrow. The great thing about "How to train your dragon" is that although there is a happy ending, it is not precisely an eezy peezy pink candy sweet kind of happy ending - it is a surprisingly serious happy ending in which relief, happiness and cheerfulness are mixed with just a tiny little bit of sadness (not enough to make little kids cry though).<br /><br />Bottom line, this film is a treasure and a pleasure. If you didn't see it, go get it. It will make you laugh a lot, cheer you up no matter how bad was your day. And the PERFECT first date scene will mend many wounds that time unavoidably inflicted to your heart (as it did to all of us) and certainly make you smile with just the right kind of nostalgy (if you are a fully grown up adult) ot just the right kind of expectation (if you are still in your early teens). ENJOY!</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>What was already one of the most lovingly crafted and moving stories - however misleading the title - is just entralling and lifted to perfection by great 3D! A story with many themes and sub themes, all of which - of themselves - are tender and child-pleasing (of any age)  and create a movie that is and will remain a masterpiece of the simplicity of the role of real love in our lives.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A lean, mean story - not a wasted moment and every moment is important. This is a fine movie well worth seeing in 2D; even more so in 3D because there is some very good animation that takes advantage of 3D without distracting from the story by being done just to say "Hey, we're in 3D". The movie starts out looking like it will be just your average Dreamworks animated throwaway but keeps building the world and the characters and the story rapidly surpassing our expectations and then just continues getting better right to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>I went out one day on a whim and decided to see this when it was in the theatre and I loved it!  I don't often always see a lot of the animated movies in the theatre, but instead wait until dollar theatre or Netflix or something, but I had seen everything else at the theatre at the time I wanted to see and wound up seeing this.  Loved it!  It was among one of the better animated movies I had seen around that time, other than like Toy Story 3, and later Rango and Kung Fu Panda 2.  I bought this up on Blu-Ray right when it came out and have watched it several times since.  If you're at all into animated movies, this is definitely one to watch.  It's overall pretty good for kids, though there are a couple of parts that might be scary.  I'd say it's good for maybe ages 5+.  In any case though, this is a must see animated movie!  I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I turned on the television yesterday and this movie was on. I had no intention of watching the whole thing, but after a few minutes, I was hooked! "How to Train Your Dragon" is a wonderful story about a young Viking boy, Hiccup, who never warms to his people's love of fighting and killing dragons. Hiccup eventually encounters and befriends a dragon, who he names Toothless. (And let me tell you, this dragon is adorable...reminds me of my cat for some reason.) Together, Hiccup and Toothless join together to save Hiccup's people from certain doom.<br /><br />This is such a wonderful story about friendship, morality, and about being kind to animals. I really enjoyed it and think it's a movie that all parents should watch with their kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>DreamWorks has hit an absolute homerun with How to Train Your Dragon.  Holding its own against anything from Pixar, the animation is nearly unparalleled.  The story of Hiccup (Baruchel), a gangly Viking teen with pipe-cleaner arms, is one of courage, understanding, and acceptance.  When all other Vikings are learning to engage in war or actually battling the evil dragons alongside Hiccup's conspicuously-named father Stoick (Butler), young Hiccup must ignore his fears and unfortunate name to show the others a more delicate and ultimately superior approach toward winning over the dragons.<br /><br />The primary draw of HTTYD is of course the animation.  One scene in particular shows multiple characters flying over an ocean that literally made me want to dive in.  The waves, the colors, the breakers, the motion, it was all perfect.  The water itself could have been replaced in any non-animated movie and not a sole would have noticed.  The rest of the animation came in a close second, with amazing detail in every blade of grass, every eyebrow raise, every gust of wind.  Stunning.<br /><br />Not simply a movie for the kids, this is perfect for all ages.  It's truly wonderful, with all facets of comparably good films represented.  The score is magnificent, allowing a viewer to be absorbed into the action.  The characters are well developed, diverse, interesting, and heartwarming; they blend perfectly.  The story itself is a classic tale of underdog winning by unorthodox methods to save the day, become famous, and get the girl.  Nearly everything works together seamlessly.<br /><br />In my opinion, there are only minor negatives of the film.  First and foremost, Jay Baruchel's nasally, whining voice fits the character, but comes across as fingernails on a chalkboard.  The other flaw as I see it, and it is admittedly minor, is the grayed moral relativism.  The primary antagonist was doing nothing wrong, merely surviving, and I couldn't help but compare her/it to Bambi's mother as an innocent character who met its demise.  Is it only sad when an ugly character or creature suffers?<br /><br />Nonetheless, I can't praise this movie enough.  I give it my highest possible recommendation.  There is a story and lesson for every age.  DreamWorks has really produced an outstanding movie that deserves repeat viewings.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>I just recently entered the world of Blu-ray and I picked this movie as my first disc. I was not disappointed! The movie itself is amazing with stunning visuals, great humor, and real adventure (not to mention a powerful score by John Powell).The movie on blu-ray looks absolutely stunning. The animated water looks so real, as if the drawings were placed on photographs. Not only am I very pleased with the quality of the movie, but this blu-ray disc is confirmation that I'll never go back to standard definition. If you haven't purchased a blu-ray player, this movie is a great reason to experience hi-def movie watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />In this day and age when quality animated features are the rule rather than the exception, "How to Train Your Dragon" still manages to beat all comers with its charm, imagination and honest sentiment.<br /><br />Based on the story by Cressida Cowell, the movie focuses on Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Jay Baruchel), the scrawny young son of a Viking leader (Gerard Butler) who worries that his boy may not possess the mettle a true Viking warrior must have to smite the many dragons that periodically swoop in on the village to steal its food.  It's not that Hiccup doesn't WANT to be a dragon-slayer; heck, he's even enrolled in a dragon-slaying course replete with real dragons for the students to practice their moves on.  No, the problem is that Hiccup has met and made friends with an injured dragon in the wild (a beast he calls Toothless) and the lad soon discovers that dragons are not the natural-born enemies to Man that he and the other Vikings thought they were.<br /><br />Beyond its glorious visuals, eye-popping action sequences, and terrific voiceover work, "How to Train Your Dragon," written and directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, emerges as a surprisingly compelling human tale of a boy who wants desperately to live up to the high standards his demanding father has set for him, but who just can't betray his new-found best friend in order to do so.  Without getting sappy about it, the movie provides fine moral lessons for the youngsters - though, one should point out that the intensity of the action scenes may prove a tad disturbing for the very littlest in the audience.  Its soaring flight scenes are some of the best we've ever encountered in an animated movie, and its canny combination of humor, adventure and sentiment catapult it to the head of the class among recent animated films (along with "Toy Story 3," that is).</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>How to Train Your Dragon has all of the best qualities of Pixar/Dreamworks movies: the lovable characters, great CG graphics, and comedy. While the overall design of the dragons is comic, their skin looks incredibly realistic. I did however take one star off for lack of originality. In many respects, the plot is pretty predictable and the same as many other "boy-meets-the-enemy" type movies. The boy befriends the dragon a bit too easily, first with food then healing his broken tail fin. Overall, it's a cute story, and families will surely enjoy it, but I don't know how much enduring appeal it will have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>I grew up in a household that fully embraced things like mythical creatures. That's not to say that it caused me to believe unicorns actually existed or anything like that, but just that the idea was something imaginative and fun to think about rather than being evil and stupid or some nonsense. But dragons were always something we came back to. They've always been considered cool in my family. You could say that they were a big part of my childhood. While a film featuring dragons doesn't automatically make it a good one, How to Train Your Dragon managed to speak to that inner kid in me and always had the potential to be something extraordinary. Thankfully first impressions can be right every so often.<br /><br />Most DreamWorks Animation films are fairly lackluster at best outside of the first Shrek film and the Kung Fu Panda films. That along with the incredible reputation How to Train Your Dragon has (8.2 on IMDb, 74/100 on MetaCritic, 98% on Rotten Tomatoes) were both fairly overwhelming. There was no way this film could possibly live up to the praise and hype people were giving this thing. Well junior, my subconscious told myself after viewing the film, it is. So get over yourself.<br /><br />A strong point for any animated film is its animation, obviously. How well it's animated can be a major factor in the film being enjoyable or not, but How to Train Your Dragon delivers in every way imaginable. Colors are rich and motions are fluid; the water in the film looks incredibly realistic. I honestly wasn't a big fan of the human character designs at first. They seemed kinda childish, goofy, and underwhelming, but it really doesn't take long for them to win you over as each one of them has their own eccentric traits to give them likeable personalities. You get absorbed into this world and the island of Berk so easily, which is all any film should aim for. The film must look amazing on Blu-ray and must've been a glorious ride in theaters in 3-D.<br /><br />Hiccup's story is really the backbone of the film. It brings emotion, meaning, and most of all heart to what is otherwise just Vikings versus dragons up until that point. Hiccup's relationship with Toothless is what makes the film special. Their interactions with each other make you laugh at times and break your heart at others in a way that none of the rest of the film can really measure up to. And if none of that is able to win you over the scenes where Hiccup rides Toothless will. Just about everyone has dreamt of flying at some point. This throws you directly into that sensation and pulls it off flawlessly.<br /><br />How to Train Your Dragon is a truly spectacular animated film featuring fantastic animation and an engrossing story. Along with its engaging characters and an emotionally thrilling relationship between a boy and his pet, it's easily one of the best animated films of the past few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON (2010) is a delightful and beautifully animated fantasy-themed story, the story of Viking teen Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) and his endeavors to fit in with his village. Also, they have the usual nasty dragon infestation and that turns out being the key to Hiccup's success.<br /><br />This is one of the most beautifully finished, well-shot animated features I've seen since THE INCREDIBLES and SURF'S UP. While it is slightly lacking in vocal talent (the best they could do was Jay Baruchel and America Ferrara as their lead voices??) it certainly isn't lacking in story, humor, charm or pure animation accomplishment. While I will not spoil anything further, I have to skewer the animators on one point: why is the most important dragon in this film made to look like Stitch from LILO AND STITCH?<br /><br />The details, though, make that well worth enduring; I loved all the different funny dragons and the Runic book which Hiccup is studying intently during his dragonslayer training. Saying which, though this film does borrow a bit too liberally from DRAGONHEART, young viewers won't notice - and won't care.<br /><br />All I can add is this film brought a sorely needed smile to my face, and is one of the best animated features I've seen in years. With the bizarre happenings at Pixar and Dream Works taking over the field, I was wondering when the next animated extravaganza would appear. Well, here it is, warts and all, and I love it. Kids from 3 to 103 are going to adore this great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>How to Train Your Dragon (Single Disc Edition) is an amazing animated movie from Dreamworks.

Highly recommended. 5/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Based on a nine novel series by Cressida Cowell.  Focus is on a geeky viking boy who doesn't fit in with his rough and ready father's brute dudes.  Along the way of trying to prove himself he wounds and then later befriends one of the toughest of dragon types that eventually lets him ride it.  This is basically a well done tale of a boy and his "dog" with themes of acceptance at the forefront.  My nieces and nephews loved this one.  Adults should like it in varying degrees as well.  The ending, which was bittersweet, came as a surprise.  I didn't think they would push it that far but they did.  The twins are the best kid supporting characters.

The story we actually saw had more depth and more surprises than what I was expecting from an animated movie. I'm not going to go into the story. It is well documented. If you haven't read those reviews I don't want to be the one to provide the spoilers, but to be brief a Viking boy who is smart but a failure as a beefy warrior winds up with a different experience with the dragons his village has been at war with than his fellow villagers are having. You'll have a lot of fun as he learns to deal with his new situation, and astounds others with his new learned abilities.<br /><br />The voice performances were convincing, and the animation was just plain fun. It was a more cartoon style animation than some of the more realistically based animated movies that have been produced recently, but that was just fine. The 3D in the theater was fun, but the Blu Ray will not disappoint. Colors in this movie are rich. Some of the dragons look dragon-scary, but some of them are silly and funny. Since this is a movie primarily for kids, the silly and funny dragons are just fine.<br /><br />Highly recommended for family viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>Both my wife and I really enjoyed this film; now that's saying a lot, especially where my wife is concerned as she will often walk out on a video we are watching after the first few minutes if she doesn't like it. This is a captivating family film that features a compelling story and interesting characters.<br /><br />Both the video and audio are top notch with the action battle scenes with the dragons dramatically involving the surround speakers; one definitely gets a feeling of being in the middle of the action!<br /><br />I believe this one will bear up to repeated viewings even for the adults, it's a fun movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Who knew that Jay Baruchel sounds exactly like Christian Slater? I mean my wife and I we're shocked when the credits rolled and saw that the lead voice of Hiccup was played by Jay, um, uh, Barawho and not Slater. Anyway....<br /><br />How to Train Your Dragon is a great family movie and it came recommended to me by several friends that don't even have kids. Now, I've seen some animated features (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I654UI">The Incredibles</a>) that could potentially make my all time list of favorite movies, but I'd have to think hard about any animated movie that would make it into my top 20 of all time. And of my top 20 favorite movies half would likely only get 4 versus 5 stars. Dragon would land on a separate list somewhere only in about the middle of the pack of just my favorite "animated" movies. It's a good movie...but classic? Nah.<br /><br />Against his father's will, the timid Hiccup sneaks out with a new weapon he designed. Turns out the weapon works pretty well and he brings down the most feared dragon in the land with it. The weapon doesn't kill the beast, and as the title of the movie might suggest, Hiccup instead forms a friendship with the monster that could change human/dragon relations forever.<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained. My wife thought it was okay. My kids...they liked it. No one was wowed. Perhaps I've spoiled my family with my liberal stance of letting them watch pretty much anything they want (within reason). Or maybe we've all just overdosed on reruns of the early <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DYJTVW">SpongeBob Episodes</a> on DVD. Cuz, I'll tell ya what, if you said to me that Nick is running a marathon of the first 50 SpongeBob episodes or Cartoon Network is premiering How to Train Your Dragon, I'd been tuning into Nick.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIZ4M">Toy Story</a> is a 5 star animated movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXJ">Shrek</a> is a 5 star animated movie. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LVCM">A Bug's Life</a> is a 5 star animated movie. How to Train Your Dragon is a really good animated feature that will soon be forgotten by all who watched on my TV set. Don't get me wrong...Dragon is definitely a worthy rental at minimum. It's just not a classic. But as of this writing about 90% of the other reviewers here might disagree with me, so please take my review for what it's worth: an opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>After all the rave reviews, I was disappointed, and I love Dragon themes. It does have great animation and it is great for kids, but lacks the humor of Shrek. I will watch it again to verify my conclusions. Shrek I have watched several times just for the fun of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>For me, this was by far the best of the 3-D animated films to reach the big screen this year.  Not much is lost in the hi-def 2-D version now available. There are sweeping vistas, believable characters and a majestic sense of flying with the dragons.<br /><br />The story is simple. Hiccup, a young Viking, defies tradition by befriending a deadly foe, a ferocious dragon he calls Toothless.  Together they must fight tradition and find a way to save both their worlds.<br /><br />Superbly designed in all aspects -- the characters, the world and the story come together to create a wondrously entertaining diversion for all ages.  I don't say that loosely.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Basic story is that a young Viking, from the North on the Island of Berk, who was keen on hunting trolls, gets his opportunity at an elusive dragon. When he confronts his Viking ways he must decide for himself weather to dispatch his prey or will he come to an understanding of the true nature of the beast.  If you own cats you can see the dilemma and the conflict. Not that any feline is in danger of being dispatched.<br /><br />There is nothing unique about this movie.  The story is old as the hills. The animation while not intrusive to the message is not unique either. There are no news truths or insights or anything.  There is the standard minus and a boy coming of age with others attempting to do so also. It is refreshing to find the single family parent is the father however it is the old single parent family conflict. The one big flaw in the story is that the only dragon that could use befriending was targeted for dispatching by everyone including fellow dragons; what kind of message does that send?  I have to admit I did not read the book so I cannot compare the book/movie.<br /><br />On the positive side they picked some good voices (see the DVD extras) for the individual characters. They did not constantly bombard the movie with unrelated background music. There attempt at cute contemporary dialog works pretty well. The dialog was not drummed down as most of the later Disney movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>Oh my god. How to train your dragon is amazing. I love it. I wish there was another chapter of the story. I'm in luv! Legend of the  BoneKnapper Dragon was 16 minutes in length, 13? minutes of which was the movie itself. It is too short and the story feels too simple, and undone. It could be a lot better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), a puny Viking boy wants to kill dragons to impress his fellow vikings and to prove he's as tough as one of them. However, he finds that he's more of a dragon trainer than he is a dragon killer when he captures a dragon. His gentle pet dragon teaches Hiccup that his people were wrong about dragons all along. But can Hiccup get the point across to his macho dragon hunting father (Gerald Butler) ?<br /><br />  How to Train Your Dragon is easily one of Dreamworks best. Hell, I think I even enjoyed it more than anything else they have done. The movie is funny, exciting and even some-what moving. The animation is also top notch. The story may be similar to live action dragon films like Dragonheart and Eragon but this movie is much better than both of those films. The story is better executed and the action is more exciting.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>... there lived a boy who couldn't quite live up to the bar his father set for him in his life. Despite his efforts, he usually failed to the chagrin of the town and the man (his father) who was its leader. Hiccup (a quite apt and funny name for this lad) one night decides to prove himself by launching a trap for the nefarious "Night Fury" dragon, and surprise, he snags one. Finding it wounded in the forest, the boy learns not only how to care for and train his dragon, but also, how to find his own unique footing in his life. Such is the tale of the heart warming and wonderfully vivid family family, "How to Train Your Dragon."<br /><br />Created by Dreamworks, which always seems to be in the shadows of the superstar Pixar, has finally come into its own with this cinematic experience. One of the first things you might notice is the spectacular flying sequences between Hiccup and Toothless. The magic of the animation is spotless, and what even makes it more breathtaking is the fact that there is little to no dialogue in these scenes. That adds to the splendor of seeing Hiccup fly, both literally and symbolically, over his village and life.<br /><br />Dreamworks concentrated on the usual Pixar strengths, of story, of character, of heart. This movie has all three, and all three in spades. The ending of the movie, which shant be revealed here, is one worthy of a few Kleenex. I, a somewhat cynical and hardened viewer to sentimental scenes, was totally taken off kilter by the enchanting surprise of emotion embedded in the context of the film. Dreamworks nailed it.<br /><br />Parents, be wary of very young kids seeing this film. I would have no problems having my second grader on up seeing this film, but anyone younger may have trouble with some scary dragon scenes, especially towards the end, warranting the PG rating.<br /><br />However, what lingers with me after seeing this movie is the strong relationship threaded throughout, esepcially between our hapless hero Hiccup and his man-killing dragon Toothless. For "How to Train Your Dragon" is in itself a wonderful metaphor, for never judging people too harshly before one gets to know them a little bit, and the benefits reaped when one does. A bit adventure, a bit fun, a bit emotional, all makes for a wonderful time at the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> Who knew? Fire-breathing dragons deep down inside are really touchy-feely creatures as long as you know how to train them right. That essentially is the premise of the much-acclaimed Dreamworks animated film, 'How to Train Your Dragon'. Of course there's a deeper message here (quoting the late Rodney King): "Why can't we all get along?".<br /><br />This is perhaps the first film I can remember where the great pillaging clan of Vikings are not pitted against human opponents and hence their reputation as a group of sadistic, murderous thugs is tempered by the aggression of their dragon antagonists. Leave it to the film's protagonist, Hiccup, the young nerdy son of the Viking leader, Stoick the Vast (curiously voiced by Gerard Butler, with a Scottish accent!), to teach his community an important lesson: it's better to use your brains instead of brawn.<br /><br />It takes a while for 'Dragon' to get going as the break into the second act doesn't occur until Hiccup begins nursing 'Toothless', the cute but hyperactive dragon (that he's responsible for injuring), back to health. Toothless looks like a leopard with wings but appears to have the temperament of a lovable canine. It turns out that the dragons have an excuse for all their bad behavior: they're beholden to a giant 'killer' dragon who the Vikings fear but who have never seen. Hiccup uncovers the mystery of this frightening behemoth when he flies into its lair after figuring out how to pilot Toothless, without falling off of him, in the air.<br /><br />Meanwhile back at the Viking village, Hiccup, much to his chagrin, is forced to participate in dragon training school with a coterie of fellow young misfits. Voiced by such comic luminaries as Jonah Hill and Kirsten Wiig, Hiccup's 'associates' all follow the 'macho' Viking line: kill the unpleasant dragons at any cost. Much of the antics of the youngsters are rather one-note, as they parrot the macho posturing of the community at large. Finally, Hiccup, through his sensitive handling of the out of control creatures, turns his colleagues around and trains them how to calm the dragons down, without killing them.<br /><br />The stakes are raised when Hiccup refuses to kill a dragon at the end of the training and his father disowns him. Stoick, raises an armada of his heavily armed Vikings, and with Toothless in tow (now chained on board the lead vessel), head out to the island where the big, bad monster awaits them. Leave it to Hiccup and his buddies to save the day by flying out to the island on board the formerly imprisoned dragons (back at the training school) and eliminate the monster in a rousing fight to the finish.<br /><br />With the bad dragon eliminated, the dragon population 'understands' that the Vikings are really on their side and are now quite amenable to being house trained. And of course, even macho Stoick, sees the light and ends up apologizing to his son. I suppose all this is an acceptable children's story but adults will feel a little less satisfied. If underneath, this is a tale about how humans treat animals, it's a rather fanciful conceit that leopards or tigers (which the dragons seemingly represent), can so easily be domesticated. If on the other hand, if the dragons represent a misunderstood group of humans (demonized by the Vikings who lack the insight into their nature), the fact that they ALL suddenly become peaceful (because they're now treated with 'sensitivity' by humans), hardly seems to reflect the reality of true human-to-human interactions. Throughout history, attempts to mollify belligerent peoples through appeasement, have resulted in disastrous consequences.<br /><br />In short, 'How to Train Your Dragon', is a feel-good tale, politically correct tale, best suited for children. Adults, however, will still be much impressed by the excellent, sumptuous animation, painstakingly created over a number of years by a group of highly talented animators. Whether the animation is enough for the viewer to overlook the rather lackluster story, is a matter of personal taste. For me, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is worth a look, decidedly for its impressive technical achievements, as opposed to its rather predictable narrative.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>How to Train Your Dragon has all of the best qualities of Pixar/Dreamworks movies: the lovable characters, great CG graphics, and comedy. While the overall design of the dragons is comic, their skin looks incredibly realistic. I did however take one star off for lack of originality. In many respects, the plot is pretty predictable and the same as many other "boy-meets-the-enemy" type movies. The boy befriends the dragon a bit too easily, first with food then healing his broken tail fin. Overall, it's a cute story, and families will surely enjoy it, but I don't know how much enduring appeal it will have.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this movie.<br /><br />And it does have engaging things.<br /><br />The Night Fury dragon, Toothless, that Hiccup adopts is cute and likable.  In the commentary, the animators talk a long time about how hard they had to work to fashion a cute, yet still scary, face.<br /><br />One look at "Stitch" from "Lilo and Stitch" will show that they needn't have worked so hard.  They could have stolen Stitch's (maybe they did).<br /><br />Likewise, the moral is engaging: better to understand and befriend than demonize and kill.<br /><br />Also, Astrid is cute, and the love-story is humorously un-romantic.<br /><br />But still, I had a hard time liking it.<br /><br />One reason was Jay Baruchel's voice for Hiccup.  In the commentary, Baruchel becomes effusive with what a super, great, life-changing and world-changing movie this was.  But it isn't.  I can't tell if Baruchel actually believes this, or is just protesting too much.  Baruchel gets the "Christian-Slater-Talk-Alike" award, but his whinyness gets old fast.<br /><br />Another reason is the static appearance of Stoick, Hiccup's father.  Yes, he is mildly engaging, but only mildly.  The animators talk at length about what a breakthrough he is, but his braided beard and furry coat look merely painted on, and his body moves like a robot.<br /><br />The dragons are uniformly cute and interesting, but the human characters are uniformly monotonous.<br /><br />Despite the raves of all the people who worked on the movie (in the commentary), really it is nothing special to look at.  And even if it were, mere appearance can never make up for mediocre characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Beautifully filmed and using good actors for voice performances, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON was a big box office draw in 2010.  It has eye-popping visuals and lots of high-powered action sequences to frame it's all too familiar tale of a young Viking lad who befriends an injured dragon and achieves his manhood.<br />I enjoyed most of the film, but there's nothing new here and even kids minds may wander.  Certainly it's a well-done if routine film.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I've been recommended this film many times since it was released, and it has tons of glowing reviews, so I expected to love it.  I'm obviously in the minority, but I do not think this even comes close to rivaling a Pixar film for quality.  My husband and my mom watched this with me (no kids).  We have enjoyed many Pixar films, but all agreed this was disappointing.  Yes, this is an excellent film for kids, but not for adults.  I did love that the dragons had cat-like characteristics.  It was an interesting take on them that brought some humor to the story.  Plus, the graphics were top notch.  Visually, the movie is great.  However, it is the story that falls short.<br /><br />This felt like a 30 minute film had been stretched to an hour and a half.  The entire first hour was very slow, even boring at times.  It's almost 45 minutes in before Hiccup even starts training the dragon.  And the story has a "been there, done that" feel.  Scrawny kid that no one respects, bullied by his peers, uses intelligence to save the day.  A great lesson sure, but lacking originality.  Plus, none of the characters stand out besides Hiccup.  After watching the film, I cannot recall the name of any other character besides him and Toothless!  What saved the film for me, and the reason I gave it 3 stars, is that the last 20-25 minutes were fantastic.  It was a very exciting, action-packed happily-ever-after conclusion. I would watch that part again.  Overall I am glad I did not pay theatre prices to see this.  I understand that a sequel has already been green-lit. I might give it a try if it has a more original storyline.  Recommended for families.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>How to Train a Dragon is a coming of age movie. The usual stuff. The overbearing father, with the son who embarrasses him because of his lack of mini-me-ness, tries to force said son to man-it-up and get on with it already. Son does the one thing he can think of to impress his whole village but screws even that up. But while doing so he discovers truth that will change everything his dad, his whole village, his whole world believed. Add humor, fighting, action and a few scary moments, make it animated, throw in a love interest and lots of dragons and you've got an entertaining movie. My Viking fanatic friend would have a hissy regarding the Viking hats. Apparently the Vikings did not have horns on their helmets. But I digress.<br /><br />My one complaint. It's a kid movie with enough stuff to draw in the adults and keep their attention, too, but they took it beyond dragons. There is a mini makeout scene. And the tough girl love interest throws out some very realistic stand-in "cuss" words during a temper tantrum. Not needed. I don't know if those elements are thrown in for teens, to get them interested. But for the 8-10 year old little boys, all it would take is the dragons....</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>1.  Nothing like Americans to retroactively cram their values down the throats of alien cultures.  Like I'm so sure the Viking women are gonna be donning battle gear and launching out on dragon-slaying expeditions right along with the men.<br /><br />2.  Ultimately just another predictable "our enemies aren't so bad if we'd just take the trouble to understand them" flick.  Hard to believe this stuff gets made during what is, after all, wartime.  I wonder how vets returning from Iraq and Afghanistan feel about this trend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Dreamworks has scored a major hit with this fun movie that the entire family will enjoy.<br /><br />Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a young viking-in-training.  Pressured by his father Stoick the Great (Gerard Butler), Hiccup is supposed to learn how to slay dragons like all vikings do. Hiccup has been led to believe that all dragons are evil and must be killed before the dragons kill them.  Believing what he's been hearing, Hiccup makes a special weapon of his own to bring down one of the feared dragons.<br /><br />Hiccup manages to bring down a night fury; the most feared dragon of all.  But instead of being excited for his deed, Hiccup feels bad for the injured dragon.  Soon, the two have become close friends, and Hiccup has named him Toothless.  In no time, Hiccup has fashioned a saddle and is soaring high in the sky on Toothless' back.<br /><br />But, Hiccup still has his father to deal with.  Stoick, thrilled at Hiccup's bringing down the dragon, has insisted that he begin formal dragon training.  The only thing that Hiccup likes about it is that he gets to be near Astrid (America Ferrera).  During the course of his training, Hiccup begins to learn that the dragons aren't really evil at all; they are just like the vikings, hoping to survive.  However, convincing his father will be another matter.  Hiccup and Toothless soon discover that the dragons are merely pawns in a larger game controlled by a huge, menacing creature.  Will Hiccup, Astrid, and the others be able to save the dragons, or will the creature destroy both the dragons and the vikings?<br /><br />I've seen numerous animated movies with my children, and I have to rate "How to Train Your Dragon" as one of the best.  The special effects are excellent, and the story is good, too.  I enjoyed watching the relationship develop between Hiccup and Toothless, and the comedy left me laughing out loud.  My three kids are big fans, too.  For a fun family movie, watch "How to Train Your Dragon".  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>With a review title as ambitious as mine, some justification is definitely in order.  See unlike Pixar (with a little help of the Disney promotion machine), animated hits with the potential to become pop culture icons aren't a given for DreamWorks.  Sure they've had Shrek but ask anyone and you'll discover that 4 feature films and a variety of spin-offs have milked the franchise past its worth.  Kung-Fu Panda came next with signs of brilliance.  Proponents however were quick to point out the fact that marital-arts references simply aren't universal enough (however hilarious) to challenge the clever-ness of your average Pixar piece.<br /><br />Enter How to Train Your Dragon, a 2010 animated work based loosely on a 2003 children's book by Cressida Cowell of the same name.  Coming in at a runtime of 98-minutes, Dragon gained enough critical acclaim to warrant a video game series, a sequel planned for release sometime in the summer of 2013, a Cartoon Network animated weekly series beginning in 2012, plans for a live-tour, and the Blu-ray earning a spot in Samsung's Home 3D Starter Kit.<br /><br />I was vaguely aware of the hype surrounding this one going in, and even so came away absolutely dazzled with the end result.  But before digging into what it is that makes this motion picture a crowning achievement, let's assemble a small summary of the plot, shall we?<br /><br />The story takes place in a mythical Norse world called Berk and follows the exploits of a skinny Viking teenager named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel).  Residing in a land torn by constant threat of brutal dragon invasion, Hiccup finds himself struggling to gain the approval of his gruff father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler).<br /><br />Insisting on entering into battle (to prove his valor), Hiccup ends up using one of his inventions to take down a mysterious and highly feared Night Fury class dragon but is seen by the villagers as only the cause of unnecessary destruction.<br /><br />The next day, after tracking his fallen prey, Hiccup is faced with the fact that he can't bring himself to kill the beast (and hence instantly gain the respect he wants most out of life).<br /><br />Instead, Hiccup and the black dragon, whom, thanks to retractable teeth he dubs Toothless, forge a friendship that leads to his discovering that humans have misjudged the entire species.<br /><br />Further complicating the relationship is the fact that Hiccup finds himself enrolled in Dragon Training; a gamut of human versus captive dragon barbarism that ends with one of the students having to slay a dragon before the blood-hungry town.<br /><br />It turns out that in Berk, just like in reality, a better understanding of one's enemy can often prove more impactual than centuries of doing battle with them.<br /><br />So if right now you're thinking this all sounds cute and clich&eacute;, rest assured that there is charm in this one no summary will be able to capture accurately.  The direction and pacing are absolutely spot-on here, so much so in fact that it often becomes difficult to even remember that this is an animated film (often considered the ultimate compliment to any animator).<br /><br />The characters and corresponding cast is marvelous with enough passion and range to keep the viewer's attention precisely where it should be (on the story).<br /><br />Visuals, as one might expect on a film that cost an estimated $165 million, are stunning- especially the fire effects and flight sequences (that look amazing on the home screen in hi-def even without the much ballyhooed 3D).<br /><br />Additionally noteworthy is the fact that overly expressive animal eyes and the development of the bond between Hiccup and Toothless is conveyed here virtually without dialogue, which suggests that DreamWorks has been paying close attention to Pixar's mastery of the medium.<br /><br />John Powell's score adds to the delicious flavor with its heart-thumping tension on down to heart wrenching intimateness and everything in between.<br /><br />In all, even a film as hyped as this one can stand to have a bit more praise heaped upon it simply because it delivers in just about every conceivable level.  Truly the business-model driven DreamWorks has its masterpiece that even the nerd-farm that is Pixar need be envious of.  Don't miss this, one of the finest specimens the genre has to offer!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"How To Train Your Dragon" may be the best non-"Shrek" animated film DreamWorks has produced. It is a funny, charming, well-animated film using 3-D to enhance everything about it.<br /><br />A small Viking village constantly battles a number of dragons that repeatedly attack their small seaside hamlet. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel, "She's Out of My League", "Knocked Up") is the thin, slight young man who wants to play a bigger part in his town's defenses. But every time he steps outside of the family cottage, he ends up causing trouble. His dad, Stoic (Gerard Butler), a big, commanding Viking who is in charge of the town, wants him to remain at the blacksmith shop, under the watchful eye of his friend, Bogger (Craig Ferguson). But the dragons continue to attack and they need to train new recruits, so Stoic sneaks into a new training class and meets Astrid (America Ferrera, TV's "Ugly Betty") and they form a rivalry. Bogger throws every species of dragon at them and Astrid handily beats them while Stoic has to pay attention to keep from tripping over his own feet. One night, during an attack, Stoic tests an invention and seems to strike one of the infamous black Night Flyer dragons, hard to see when they attack at night. The next day, he escapes to the forest and finds the felled beast. They form a friendship, naming his new friend Toothless, and Hiccup begins to learn how to handle the beasts that have plagued his village for so long.<br /><br />Directed by Dean Debois and Chris Sanders (the team behind "Lilo & Stitch"), "Dragon" takes a welcome step back. Instead of trying to make everything super-realistic, the film is designed to look cartoonish. The male Vikings are big, but top heavy with broad chests and full beards. Hiccup is a tiny, gangly kid. Each of the types of dragons is different with a personality of their own.<br /><br />When Hiccup meets the Night Flyer dragon he has injured, he first tries to kill the beast, but he is unable to. Dubbing his new friend Toothless, they start to form a friendship and Hiccup learns about the other dragons his friend knows too well, using this knowledge to impress Astrid, Bogger and ultimately his father, Stoic.<br /><br />As their friendship grows, Hiccup learns the dragons are really just trying to protect themselves. In fact, they would rather just fly and play and cavort through the skies and forest. Just as this happens, his dad, Stoic, leads a group to infiltrate the hidden dragon lair, they have finally learned of the location. Hiccup tries to intervene, but his dad is determined to put a stop to the attacks.<br /><br />As Hiccup and Toothless become more familiar with one another, they become friends, and eventually play with one another. These scenes are the most endearing to me because Toothless (and the other dragons for that matter) have the characteristics or kittens and puppies. Toothless' behaviors and mannerisms could have been modeled on my cat; he prances around and pretends to hide, playfully waiting to attack Hiccup, a sly grin on his face, ready to roll around and play. The animators have done a great job of capturing this look and feel and translating it to these creatures, making them appear more familiar to us.<br /><br />Jay Baruchel does a great job providing the voice for Hiccup; he perfectly captures the pre-adolescent gravely voice reinforcing the fact he is barely a teenager, yet he lives in a society forcing these kids to become men before their time. Despite his scratchy voice, he is eager and willing to become a Viking, to fight the dragons, to use his inventions to help his father and their fellow villagers battle these beasts. Later, when he meets Toothless, he realizes he has something he never had before. A friend. Also, his friendship with Toothless provides him with an empowering freedom he has never enjoyed. As Hiccup rides his new friend, they fly through the skies. Initially, Hiccup is terrified, but he quickly learns to appreciate this newfound freedom. In fact, he seems to savor the new freedom.<br /><br />Gerard Butler's gravelly voice is perfect for Stoic, the leader of the Viking village. At times, his voice is so 'Scottish', you might mistake it for Mike Meyers doing a riff on his "Shrek" voice. In fact, I initially thought it was Meyers, as I watched the trailer the first few times. Later, when I learned it was Butler, it seemed odd two animated films from the same studio would have such similar voices. But watching the film, I quickly forgot these initial thoughts and went along with Butler. Butler's voice is so thick he seems the perfect choice to play the leader of this Viking kingdom. His character is exaggerated in the right places (overly broad torso, tiny waist, big arms), giving him the most complete feel of a cartoon character I have seen in some time.<br /><br />Craig Ferguson is also good as Bogger. Honestly, I didn't realize it was Craig Ferguson providing the voice for this character until I read the credits. Often, movie and television stars appear in animated films and simply retain their own speaking voice. When this happens, you have to ask, "what's the point?" If they aren't going to add anything to the character, couldn't anyone play the part? In Ferguson's case, he does a great job building a character and hiding himself behind the fa?ade of this Viking's voice.<br /><br />America Ferrera plays Astrid. Astrid is a fun character; a woman in a male-dominated society, she constantly wants to prove herself and make everyone realize how tough she is. As she has a reputation among her classmates, she is confident she will be able to excel at the dragon taming classes. She knows everything and is fearless enough. But Hiccup begins to use his newly acquired knowledge and quickly becomes the star pupil. Astrid becomes jealous and inquisitive and sets out to find his secret.<br /><br />Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse play the other two students in the class. They are OK, but don't really have enough time to create very memorable characters.<br /><br />"Dragon" combines a lot of elements typical to animated films, even some things that could be considered stereotypical or overdone. The beauty of this effort is these same elements are handled with a great deal of skill, making them seem interesting, seamless and believable. At the heart of the film is a fairly standard story about a boy trying to prove to his dad he isn't a loser. We've seen this a million times, but in this film, it seems more endearing somehow. Perhaps because the characters are so un-realistic and "animated", the film reminds us we are watching an animated movie, we are basically watching a moving picture book. And because of this, I found myself remembering simpler, more magical times.</p></br></body></html>

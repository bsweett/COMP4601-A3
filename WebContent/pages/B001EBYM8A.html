Excellent cast here with Harrison Ford in the title role, who gives the character the realism and depth needed to pull a challenging film like this off. Also in the cast is Tommy Lee Jones who is equally excellent as the ruthless cop on the trail of Ford and also Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano and Julianne Moore.<p>Keith Barish and Arnold Ropelson pull off this thriller triumphantly.

But he didn't do it!  Through an accident, he escapes and Federal marshal Girard goes after him, played seriously by Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />TV versus Movie!<br /><br />On TV it was a continuing series with Kimball disguising himself and avoiding Girard, going through various areas where he would use his medical knowledge to help others and became a master of disguise while he was at it.  Girard was obsessed when others gave up.<br /><br />The film has some of these elements, but seems more concerned with medical malpractice and how some doctors can go crooked.  This was the good part.  And Tommy Lee, though plays it in a wisecracking way, plays a pretty good cop.<br /><br />There were some pretty farfetched scenes:  Jumping off a waterfall would kill a normal man but not Richard Kimball!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Action and adventure, though Girard is not as obsessive as the TV series, the crooked medical men hiding behind their reputations is intense.<br /><br />Check out the TV series:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUSE">The Fugitive: Season One, Vol. 1</a></p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Every time I'm in a Ross Store I like to go to the ultra-bargain DVD rack and see what I can find. It's fun! I know, I can afford the regular price but when I can pick up "The Fugitive" DVD for under four bills, it just makes the viewing all that more pleasurable. OK. I'm a bit eccentric, but one has to have some method of choosing movies to watch late at night.<br /><br />"The Fugitive" stars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in an action-packed chase movie. It begins with Ford (playing a prominent surgeon) having his beautiful and loving wife murdered and with him getting the blame, found guilty and imprisoned. Then, while he's getting transported from one site to another, he's inadvertently involved in a train wreck and freed. Enter Jones, a super-cop from the U.S. Marshall's office, and the  chase is on. Will Ford, the chasee, escape and be able to simultaneously solve the mystery of his wife's death and invalidate his prison sentence? Or will Jones. the chaser, and his super-efficient team catch the fugitive? Well, the chaser is amazingly close to the chasee throughout the remaining 3/4 of the movie until all is finally resolved at the end. It's a fun movie to watch. Lot's of spectacular action. Good visuals and interesting characters.<br /><br />The cops (ie., federal marshals) are just incredibly efficient, so efficient that it defies credibility. Well, it's just a movie, but if cops were this good almost all of us would be in jail. I know, I know, I can suspend belief in some movies but I had trouble with the federal police in this case. Funny, sometimes things will win me over and I won't even notice the discrepancies. In this film, I noticed and it distracted from the story. In any case, the film was a good value and I'll probably watch it again sometime in the future.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Nothing to add to the many reviews of this successful pictur, save that it is no flash-in-the-pan. It looks as good today as when it was first to be seen, as a first run movie, on television, and, then, on disc. The chase for an innocent man, seeking only to prove his innocence, is right up there with the best, although not the best among them. Ford is perfectly cast as the hero without "side", without the arrogance of a man of achievement, without the loss of humanity, to which nature predisposes any person in his situation. Repetition has taken some of the luster off the Award winning Tommy Lee Jones performance; he still fits the bill, pretty well, in the role of man-hunter. There is enough action to keep up the pace and more than adequate acting skill, by the supporting cas,t ably to reinforce the stars performance.<br />Those who have never seen the movie, and who like action thrillers, should enjoy this one.  Those who have not seen it for some time, should be able to see it again with almost all the initial pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Wow! Harrison Ford really shines in this movie, doing an incredible job as a man accused and arrested for murder but who, through a remarkable freak accident, manages to escape captivity and is not idle in his stolen freedom - even as he goes in hiding, he still tries to figure out who really killed his wife. Great action scenes and intrigue - this movie is a solid class and is worth watching more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>The Fugitive is a great thriller of a movie, but holds a special place with me.  Part of this film was shot in my hometown of Sylva, NC plus many of the other surrounding areas.  This is a small town not many have heard of, small enough to be used in this film as a small town somewhere in backwoods Illinois.  I didn't know there were mountains in Illinois anyways?  The train wreck scene, which is one of the most spectacular action sequences of the film, I have had the enjoyment of seeing the preserved wreckage in person on a train ride that you can take in the area.  The scene where Harrison Ford jumps from the dam is actually Fontana Dam, located about 45 minutes west of Sylva.  Anyways, enough of the details about those scenes, but in case you were wondering, thats where they were shot.<br /><br />As a whole this movie is extremely well crafted.  You've basically got an edge of your seat thriller, updated from the 1960's tv series.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones both deliever first rate performances and have great chemistry, something that keeps this movie strong till the very end.  The story is well written and executed, and is complex enough to keep you thinking on your toes, but not too complex to ever feel left out.  The action scenes are wonderfully shot, and the chases and elements of suspense are tight.<br /><br />There's little more to say about this film, it is very good in all areas.  It doesn't contain the best story written, the best cast of characters, or the greatest action scenes of all time.  But it does have a dose of all of that, and with a very solid feel in the end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>1993's "The Fugitive" stars Harrison Ford as the title character in a very worthwhile movie remake of the 1960's television series that starred David Janssen.<br /><br />As in the TV series, Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is falsely convicted of having murdered his wife but escapes from custody during a spectacular train wreck.  Kimble returns to Chicago to seek the one-armed man who really killed his wife, while trying to stay one step ahead of his relentless pursuer.  Tommy Lee Jones reprises the role of Gerrard, the obsessed detective of the TV series.  Kimble's search for the real killer will end in a dead heat with Gerrard's pursuit of the runaway doctor inside a Chicago hotel.<br /><br />Although obviously lacking the extended suspense of the four-year TV series, the movie captures the essential elements of its predecessor.  The Fugitive tracks the real killer through a thin string of clues. At the same time, he must stay on the move and off the grid to avoid his relentless police pursuer.  Along the way, his random acts of kindness for total strangers convince the viewer of his real innocence.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is entirely credible as the doctor on the run, in a more emotional portrayal than the stoic David Janssen.  Tommy Lee Jones as the pursuing U.S. Marshal is a more complete and sympathetic character than Barry Morse's grim, humorless rendition in the original series, enough so to rate a OSCAR and his own sequel (U.S. Marshals).<br /><br />The availability of modern special effects and the need to pack the story into a feature length movie makes for breathless pacing, as the Fugitive makes a series of spectacular escapes from the law, beginning with the train wreck that saves him from the death house.  Of necessity, Kimble's trail of clues is fairly intact and leads him fairly quickly to the one-armed man, and to an unsuspected and deadly conspiracy.<br /><br />Fans of the 1960's TV program will enjoy this well-done movie if they can handle the time compression; viewers arriving fresh to the story will find this a breathless and thrilling chase with a surprising ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>This movie with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones no doubt will leave you on the edge of your seat! From the moment it begins to the end it is first rate drama. Well worth the two hours of your attention! Best drama movie around for my money!!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Movies based on television shows are frustrating for the creative team behind the adaptation and often prove to be somewhat hit and miss.  The reason is because in a TV show the writer/director gets to spread his/her story over the course of multiple episodes or even an entire season.  In a movie you only get an average of 2 hours to get your story out, which can cause problems when adapting a television series, whether it be a long-running or short lived show, for theaters because you just don't have the luxury of time.  There have been some successful adaptations, "Starsky & Hutch", `Star Trek', `Mission: Impossible', and even `Charlie's Angels' (though I didn't care for either incarnation of the franchise), along with the success there have been those that failed "The Avengers" was lackluster, and "The Dukes of Hazzard" was the most recent, and possibly the worst adaptation I have seen in a long while.  In 1993, Warner Brothers felt the calling to try their collective hand at an adaptation, and their choice was the hit TV series "The Fugitive".  To assist in the success of their endeavor the WB enlisted top-notch, veteran acting talents Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and hired director Andrew Davis hot off his highly successful submarine action film, "Under Siege".<br /><br />"The Fugitive" tells the story of Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who after a charity event arrives home to find an intruder in his house and his wife murdered.  After fighting off the intruder, Kimble alerts the police, and upon their arrival Kimble is surprised by the fact that he is arrested for the murder of his own wife.  After being found guilty at his trial and sentenced to prison, the prison bus Kimble is being transported by crashes in front of an oncoming train.  After being freed by a correctional officer to assist with the other prisoners, Dr. Kimble flees in hopes of tracking down the one-armed murderer and proving his innocence.  However, hot on Richard's trail is a relentless U.S. Marshal, Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), and his team of deputies, who will stop at nothing until their man is caught.  Let the chase begin!<br /><br />Clearly the executives at Warner Brothers made an excellent decision to make this adaptation, and managed to find the perfect cast, writer, and director to pull it off.  The cast, led by Harrison Ford (an actor that delivers a terrific performance every time) and Tommy Lee Jones (who was great in this role and was rewarded with the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), all give excellent performances, fleshing out each individual character and making the movie believable and real to the audience.  The story by David Twohy ("Pitch Black" and "The Chronicles of Riddick") is full of twists and turns, with riveting drama and action along with bits of comedy sprinkled about to lighten things up just a bit.  The direction of Andrew Davis, though not flashy by any means, delivers a very tight, well-paced manhunt movie that keeps the audience fully engrossed from start to finish, even though they already have a pretty good guess what the outcome will be, based on the source material.<br /><br />As I stated earlier some adaptations of TV shows to movies work out well and some don't, and the reasons generally stem from what I pointed out in the beginning of this review, but sometimes the results may vary depending on how committed to the project the cast/crew and the studio are.  It's nice to see that for "The Fugitive" all parties involved in the making of this picture gave their best, and the fruits of the labor paid off big time, making this movie one of the best TV series adaptations to ever be made.<br /><br />"The Fugitive" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>...that is the message from this rather illogical but fast-moving film. Poor old (wrongly convicted) Dr. Richard Kimble escapes from State Prison, and through some inexplicable legal quirk, the Federal Government takes jurisdiction for capturing him. Good thing too, since (according to this film) all state cops and other State and Local authorities are venal idiots, and the Feds, by contrast, are hyper-competent and masterful Law Enforcement Professionals (capital letters). I love the scene where Tommy Lee Jones (a Federal Marshal, no less) almost captures Kimble (Harrison Ford)... Get Down On Your Knees Richard, if you don't want to get shot!... (you can almost hear him think: "this is the proper position for ANYONE when in the presence of the all-mighty Federal Government..." By the way, fugitive Richard Kimble has not committed the ultimate crime of criticizing an incumbent politician within 30 days of an election in violation of McCain-Feingold. No, he is (wrongly) convicted of murdering his wife.<br /><br />When referring to a large drug company, Tommy Lee Jones (embodying the Federal Government) remarks "that company does nine billion dollars in sales a year... it is a monster" ... you can almost hear him say "...the kind of monster that Bill and Hillary have been fighting all their lives."<br /><br />Despite the heavy-handed portrayal as the Federal Government as the rightful Master of Us All, this is a fast-paced action film that holds the viewer's interest. Harrison Ford is as appealing as always, and Tommy Lee Jones shows us that we don't really need laws or judges to restrain the Federal Government, because it has contempt for these things anyway. After all, as Jones points out, he wants wiretaps on everyone, including Kimball's lawyer, and he will justify this later, "if I'm in a good mood." Hey, who needs the Constitution?<br /><br />Yes, I admit it, I've got an attitude about this film. I still enjoyed it though. Go figure.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL: THINK "NORTH BY NORTHWEST" AT LIGHT-SPEED & YOU'VE GOT "THE FUGITIVE"<br /><br />"North by Northwest" featured Cary Grant who had been a huge star, especially at the box-office, a lot like Harrison Ford, the star of "The Fugitive." Instead of the bi-plane that flies into and causes the gas tanker to explode with Cary Grant racing from the scene, we've got the mother of all train wrecks which Harrison Ford literally leaps from a nanosecond prior to impact!<br /><br />----- AND WE'VE GOT THE WRONG MAN! -----<br /><br />BUT THERE'S MORE -- A LOT MORE TO "THE FUGITIVE":<br /><br />Richard Kimble did not kill his wife. We knew that when we entered the theatre because we had all heard of the TV series by that name and some of us even saw the hourly mystery program when it ran in the 1960s. We knew about the one-armed man, the conviction of Dr. Kimble, and his quest to prove that a one-armed man had committed the horrific deed.<br /><br />NEVERTHELESS - "THE FUGITIVE" DELIVERS SURPRISES - SUSPENSE & RESOLUTION!<br /><br />---------------------------- WARNING - PLOT SPOILERS TO FOLLOW --------<br /><br />Somehow this very seemingly very tired theme came alive and caught my attention very early. Although I found the opening sequence a bit lurid and disturbing, it was captivating nevertheless. With an obvious sense of pacing, the trial of Dr. Richard Kimble was as rapid [on-screen] as a disclosure of the basic facts of Mrs. Kimble's murder allowed.<br /><br />From Kimble's conviction, we are jettisoned to the biggest and most visceral TRAIN WRECK sequence I have ever seen on film. More importantly, it established sympathy for Kimble as he not only barely escaped death, but he saved one of the guards in the process. This incredible action sequence led directly to the introduction of Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Marshall Sam Gerard and the unbelievable chase scenes that followed.<br /><br />The action sequences and suspense are so genuine that even the mundane scenes, like when Kimble was going through the one-armed man's private papers, were intense. No matter how many times I watch this film, I am amazed by how enthralled I am with the action and characters, despite knowing the complete storyline. I dare say that even the Master of Suspense himself couldn't have done better!<br /><br />----- THE ACTORS -<br /><br />Harrison Ford  - Dr. Richard Kimble<br />Tommy Lee Jones  - Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard<br />Sela Ward  - Helen Kimble<br />Joe Pantoliano  - Cosmo Renfro<br />Jeroen Krabbe  - Dr. Charles Nichols<br />Julianne Moore  - Dr. Anne Eastman<br />Andreas Katsulas  - Sykes "One Armed Man"<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: SPECIAL EDITION - WIDESCREEN - DIGITAL TRANSFER<br /><br />Digital transfer in Widescreen.

A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by a fast talking agent (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious "one-armed man."<br /><br />Despite the esteem the film has achieved over the years, Harrison Ford has gotten a bad rap for his very understated performance as Richard Kimble. While Tommy Lee Jones certainly had a far flashier role, Ford's intent wasn't to play "Indiana Jones", but a man whose whole life was dedicated to his career as a surgeon and his wife. Seeing his wife brutally murdered devastated him (his scene in the police interrogation room, going to pieces, was largely improvised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting) and his search for the killer was not the confident quest of an action hero, but based on uncertain, spur-of-the-moment decisions made by a desperate man, whose medical background was his only tool.  Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character.  Jones, as Marshal Sam Gerard, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran, the best at what he did, and pursuing a fugitive was 'old hat' for him. With a confidence bordering on arrogance, he ordered people about like chess pieces, multi-tasked without breaking a sweat, and still could charm with a wicked smile and sarcastic remark.  He creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent, as his only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin.<br /><br />Director Andrew Davis has not been known for exemplary work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked interest within the film industry.  With such films as "Under Siege," "Code of Silence," and "Above the Law," he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris), while here he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot).  The film is brilliantly scripted by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, who manage to remain faithful to the plot of the original show, while updating it for contemporary audiences and condensing it into a two hour narrative. James Newton Howard also does a fabulous job with his score, which is emotional and exciting at all the right moments. The story is paced very thoughtfully, so that the characters are introduced and developed meaningfully, without tedium setting in while the viewers await the action. "The Fugitive" is a terrific film, totally absorbing and exciting from beginning to end, and easily one of the best action films of its year.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>It has been said that frequently the reality overpasses the fiction. And this is precisely, the point of departure for this intriguing film, deeply enrooted in the Noir Film grounds. During his absence the wife of Dr. Kimble is being murdered, he arrives to crime scene and fights daringly with the one arm assassin but there is nothing to do. Desperately he makes all what you must not do, leaving his fingerprints around every corner of the room. The killer disappears and obviously he seems to be the main suspect.<br /><br />The train accident is by far one of the most electrifying sequences in the cinema story, magnificently gotten by the Special Effects Team. This twist of fate allows him to escape to prove his innocence.  But the Lieutenant Gerard admirably played by Tommy Lee Jones (Best Supporting Actor) will not rest until he captures to Kimble no matter how.<br /><br />The impressive human chase is only surpassed by Rambo 1, but the final result is major than the sum of its parts. Fabulous action sequences and to my mind the best performance of Harrison Ford in his career, to date.<br /><br />Well deserved acknowledgement to Andrew Davis, a talented film maker, who by the way, is almost disappeared from the map.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.<br /><br />PD. After you leave the hall, are you able to affirm (without blinking) a similar case can not be happening in any region of the world at this moment?</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>The Fugitive is one thriller that you can't go wrong with.

Richard returns home from a fund-raiser to find that his wife has been brutally murdered, and a man is still in his house.  Richard, who soon discovers that the assailant has a mechanical arm, struggle, but the man escapes.  Meanwhile, as she lay dying, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) makes a 911 phone call that appears to implicate Richard.<br /><br />Richard is tried and convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection.  Richard is to be transferred to a maximum security prison along with three other inmates.  Once on the prison bus, one inmate fakes a seizure and stabs a security guard.  Another guard begins randomly firing a shotgun and hits the bus driver by mistake.  The bus careens off the road, falls down a hill, and comes to rest on a set of railroad tracks.  Battered and shaken, Richard tries to free the wounded guard, but an ominous noise makes him stop; a train is approaching!!<br /><br />The next scenes are some of the best movie footage I've seen as Richard barely escapes before the train slams into the bus.  The engine comes uncoupled from the train and hurtles out of control, while Richard can barely move in his leg shakles.  He manages to get out of the way as the train flys past.<br /><br />U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, played superbly by Tommy Lee Jones, soon has his men hunting for Richard. aided by his sidekick Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Sam is determined to find Richard and bring him to justice.<br /><br />Richard eludes the Marshalls for the time being, but Sam soon catches up to him on a dam of all places.  Cornered, Richard does the only thing he can think of; he jumps.  Dumbfounded, Sam can only watch as Richard plummets over the side of the dam.  Sam doesn't believe that Richard died during the fall, so he sets out on his chase again.<br /><br />This is one of the best action/thrillers that I've seen.  Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford give Oscar-caliber performances, and the supporting cast of Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano, and Jereen Krabbe turn in fine performances as well.  The special effects, including the eye-popping train scene and Ford's plunge from the dam are excellent as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.  The acting is first rate, and the twists and turns will keep you guessing throughout.  Watch and see Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones at their absolute best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>An excellant film.  As a 21 year fan &amp; collector of Harrison's this is perfect.  He deserved an Oscar nomination for it.  This film made me a fan for Tommy Lee Jones, who did deserve his Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>When I first saw 'The Fugitive', I was hoping that it didn't fall into the trap of silliness that most TV-show based feature films have fallen into (remember 'Car 54', or 'Wild Wild West'?). Needless to say, I was more than pleasantly surprised to see that it went WAY beyond my low expectations! Great moments of suspense, action, and plot twists galore!<br /><br />Harrison Ford's been knocked for not putting much 'feeling' into some of his roles. But if there are emotions he does do well, it's desperation and determined stoicism with a touch of sarcasm... a perfect fit for a fugitive out to clear his name. As well, Tommy Lee Jones is a lock as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard- he plays the character's somewhat cocky and no-nonsense attitude to perfection. He also gets the best lines, and a pretty good supporting cast playing his U.S. Marshal Service cohorts (including the recently- recognized Joe Pantoliano). It's scenery-chewing at it's best, and definitely an Oscar-worthy perfomance.<br /><br /> Their performances of the two main characters and antagonists is so compelling that, like my fellow reviewers have stated before, I was rooting for the both of them throughout the presentation. It's two 'good guys' against each other, with one helping lead the other to the same end!<br /><br /> When I heard about the Special Edition DVD release, I was kinda bummed. I'd already spent a few bucks on the original release, and never anticipated the possibility of an enhanced version. But, thanks to those wonderful buyers on eBay, I got a good return on my original disc at a minimal loss, and grabbed a copy of the new one.<br /><br /> The new  disc isn't half-bad, but doesn't quite match up to the standards of other fully-loaded DVD fare as `T2 Ultimate Edition' or `The Abyss'. It features teasers, trailers, and a few behind-the-scenes bits, including the setup &amp; shooting of the train wreck. Davis even discusses a `flub' following the wreck that was cut out of the original video version, but was then digitally corrected and restored in this DVD release! And no, I'm not gonna tell you about it- you'll have to see it for yourself!<br /><br /> The commentary track by director Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones was not one of the better feature-length commentaries I've experienced. There are parts where neither of them speak for a couple minutes on end, almost like they didn't have that much to say about the movie in the first place. Jones' commentary was minimal, with mostly throwaway-type observations that didn't really add much to the track.<br /><br /> And now, my biggest gripe: Warner is STILL using cardboard snap cases for their digital discs! You'd think they'd've gotten out of the DVD Stone Age by now...<br /><br />'Late</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>Although this movie is fantastic, sadly it is one of Harrison Ford's last good performances (other than perhaps "Clear and Present Danger" in 1994).  Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife.  He escapes prison and then sets out to not only avoid recapture, but also prove his innocence.  As good as Ford's performance is, this movie is really carried by Tommy Lee Jones who plays Marshall Samual Gerard.  His humor and intensity are outstanding.  The plot is intriguing with lots of action.  This is the first movie I've had the pleasure to see in the theater, on laserdisc, on DVD, and now on HD DVD.  The HD DVD transfer is quite good and the sound is improved over the DVD version as well.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>warner continues to issue all of their products with the Nasty, NASTY VC-1 codec because it was easy for them to do it both in Blu-ray and hd-dud.

Drawing from his Indiana Jones days, Ford is just right as the besieged hero always one step ahead of disaster, but Jones's Gerard, whose drive is offset by a wry, folksy humor, is intensely charismatic as the intrepid hound-dog on Kimble's trail. Over ten years after its initial release, it's worth another peek if you haven't seen it since.

It "endures" because it is just as entertaining on the sixth viewing as it is on the first.<br /><br />Of course it helped it was based on a TV show that people my age watched religiously every week, so the plot if familiar and many of us wanted to see how the movie would stack up to the TV program. Well, as good as the TV series was, this was far better. Two scenes alone: the train wreck and Harrison Ford taking a swan dive - were worth the price of the film. Great stuff.<br /><br />The story has been discussed by many so let me just add how much I appreciate the sound in this movie. When this film first came out on VHS, I used the opening moments as a demo model for various surround systems. The DVD has enhanced that as well as the picture.<br /><br />The film has just the right amount of action scenes, very interesting characters and a storyline complex enough to bring you back for multiple viewings to totally understand it. Ford, of course, is the star with Tommy Lee Jones a close second, but the more you watch this, the more you appreciate everyone's acting in this movie.<br /><br />And, by the way, filmmakers take note: here''s another example how you can make an "edgy" modern-day crime film without a ton of unnecessary f-words.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This is one of the best-crafted action/suspense films I've ever seen.

The end result attains a luster that only grows through the years, as new audiences, through DVD and VHS, experience the same excitement we felt, viewing it on a theater screen. In the last decade, only a handful of suspense films could be called 'great'...and on top of the list is THE FUGITIVE.<p>Based on the popular David Janssen TV series, the film faithfully follows the same premise; a doctor is convicted of his wife's death, but escapes before his execution, and tracks down the 'one-armed man' responsible for the murder, as a driven law officer attempts to recapture him. Being a big-budget film, however, the scale of everything is expanded...Dr. Richard Kimble is now a brilliant vascular surgeon, at a major Chicago hospital; the handicapped killer is a dirty ex-cop working on orders from crooked board members of a billion-dollar pharmaceutical firm; and the lawman is no longer a solitary police lieutenant, but a deputy United States Marshal, and his team of agents! While some fans of the original series complained that the 'intimacy' the series had was lost, director Andrew Davis only used the 'bigger' aspects as plot elements, placing the focus, wisely, on the dual stories of Kimble's search, and Gerard's pursuit.<p>Despite the esteem the film has achieved over the years, Harrison Ford has gotten a bad rap for his very understated performance as Richard Kimble. While Tommy Lee Jones certainly had a far flashier role (earning him an Oscar as 'Best Supporting Actor'), Ford's intent wasn't to play 'Indiana Jones', but a man whose whole life was dedicated to his career as a surgeon, and his wife (played, in flashbacks, by the lovely Sela Ward). Seeing his wife brutally murdered devastated him (his scene in the police interrogation room, going to pieces, was largely improvised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting). His search for the killer was not the confident quest of an action hero, but based on uncertain, spur-of-the-moment decisions made by a desperate man, whose medical background was his only tool. Fear does not lend itself to flashy theatrics...<p>Jones, as Marshal Sam Gerard, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran, the best at what he did, and pursuing a fugitive was 'old hat' for him. With a confidence bordering on arrogance, he ordered people about like chess pieces, multi-tasked without breaking a sweat, and still could charm with a wicked smile and sarcastic remark. Of COURSE he wins the audience's heart!<p>Featuring some of the most spectacular action scenes ever recorded on film (the train/bus wreck that frees Kimble, the dive off a dam into the churning maelstrom of the reservoir), as well as two slam-bang fistfights when Kimble finally gets 'justice', THE FUGITIVE still is remembered primarily for the suspenseful Jones/Ford 'cat-and-mouse' chase, cross-country, and the grudging respect that grows between them...which, ultimately, was what the TV series was best remembered for, as well.<p>There is magic, here!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TV6SBCWT7P8S.html">A2TV6SBCWT7P8S</a><br/><p>This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire time and was great fun! It is a clever, well-directed thriller that also features great performances, especially from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. <p>The Fugitive, which is based on a TV series, is the story of a Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a man wrongly convicted of brutally murdering his wife. After the bus carrying him to prison manages to crash into a train (impressive special effects on the crash scene), Kimble escapes then attempts to solve the mystery of who actually killed his wife. At the same time, however, he has to keep on the run from an obsessive detective (Tommy Lee Jones) who is as determined to find him as he is to stay free. <p>There are many exciting twists and turns in the plot, which involves a one-armed man and a medical fraud...and to say any more about it would be to give too much away. Anyhow, this is one of the best recent thrillers - it has some great scenes, good action sequences, some comic moments, great acting (Ford and Jones are perfect...you simply root for whoever is on screen at the time), and is not TOO violent (although some of the initial scenes which show the wife being murdered are pretty grusome). This is one of the few recent Hollywood blockbusters that actually deserves its popularity - see it and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>The movie itself is a 5-star movie but I can only give this release three stars because of the simply horrid transfer afforded it. Until Amazon comes up with a different rating system that allows us to grade the technical quality of the product (transfer etc) and the product itself (the movie) I have to give it a lower score than the movie deserves.<br />The movie features Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man falsely accused of the murder of his wife. Escaping from captivity a manhunt is launched for Kimble, led by U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (played in an Oscar winning performamce by Tommy Lee Jones). The ensuing action details Kimble's attempts to clear his name, all the while trying to evade his pursuers. Director Andrew Davis crafts a taught and exciting movie and delivers what is one of the best movies of the 1990s. But for all the movie does right Warner have seen fit to deliver it to Blu-ray in a transfer that is at times painful to watch with a soft and undefined image that contains large amounts of grain and is overall dull with a lack of detail. The Blu-ray fares somewhat better in the audio department however with a very active, if average by todays standards, track. Where Warner does deserve high marks is inclusion of all of the special features from the Special Edition DVD including a feature-length commentary track with Davis and Tommy Lee Jones that contains a lot of good information despite some long pauses. There os also a smattering of featurettes.<br />Overall a disappointing presentation of an exceptional movie. Here is hoping that Warner revisits this title soon</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>"The Fugitive" to me is my favorite movie starring Harrison Ford outside of either the "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" trilogies. This movie to me showcased how an actor who was known by two movie series could branch out into totally new territory and "The Fugitive" is the best example of this. This is my favorite movie starring Harrison Ford outside the ID movies he starred in during the 1980s. I have never seen the original TV series so I'm not going to bother comparing that with the movie. Starring Harrison Ford as the surgeon Richard Kimble, and Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard, these two actors were perfect for their roles as antagonistic good guys, both are on the side of good but are major rivals at heart, Kimble as a man on the run, and Gerard as the pursuer of him, unaware that the real killer of Kimble's wife is walking freely without trouble and actually has one arm (His other was presumably lost in an accident). <p> It all begins at Chicago Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago where Richard Kimble is a highly respect, world renowned surgeon who is skilled surgically grafting new artificial limbs to amputees. His life however is wrecked one night when his wife Helen Kimble is murdered by an intruder and Richard Kimble is arrested and convicted of the murder of his wife when in fact, it wasn't him. After a catastrophic bus crash kills several of his cellmates, Kimble escapes and tries to get back home, determined to hunt down the one who is truly responsible for his wife's murder. Kimble is being chased down by numerous law enforcement agents who are also determined to catch him and have him put to death but Kimble tirelessly pursues the man who is really responsible for his wife's murder and the destruction of his reputation. His chief pursuer U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard however is tirelessly hot in his trail and Kimble is always on the move. A lot of really surprising answers will be discovered during Kimble's pursuit of his wife's real killer and a very shocking truth will come up about the motives behind the murder. Kimble is hell bent on proving his innocence.<br /><br /> Almost everything that can be good about a movie especially a crime thriller comes together perfectly on "The Fugitive". The main characters Richard Kimble and Sam Gerard are absolutely incredible and show amazing depth and personality. One feels incredible sympathy for the falsely accused criminal Richard Kimble but also appalled at the Marshall's hell-bent pursuit of him when he's unaware or even cares of the target he's chasing isn't the one responsible. Chicago to me, was the perfect city for the movie to be filmed in, and the various places they go are sometimes out of the usual places and even go to places that most people don't ever see. I also love how both Kimble, and the U.S. Marshall officers figure out where Kimble really is and how Kimble himself outsmarts them every time. A lot of things really come to mind when seeing this film. When I first saw this a long time ago, it was a lot of fun with the non stop action but now I have come to realize that sometimes some of the most innocent people have been incarcerated for absolutely heinous crimes that were committed by others and even met their tragic end when the real criminals have gotten away with it even if the criminals do get apprehended in the end. <p> Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are absolutely amazing in this movie and really brought their characters to life on here. Harrison Ford's role as Richard Kimble is absolutely powerful and moving and the numerous ways he gets places and defies his captors are just amazing, and even scary at times considering that serious real life criminals like drug dealers and serial killers and other felons use various means to defy the law. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones steals the stoplight....eh , I meant spotlight as the obsessive U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard as he is obsessively pursuing Kimble and bringing him in but also the two when speaking by phone are in fact helping to solve the real puzzle behind the crime that claimed Mrs. Kimble's life and pursue the real criminal whose behind it all. The other character worth mentioning is Dr. Nichols (The actor who plays him eludes me) as he brings some surprising answers especially towards the latter half of the movie. I also liked Joe Pantoliano as Gerard's sidekick Cosmo Renfro.<p> You must get this movie. "The Fugitive" is one of the most gripping, edge of your seat, action crime thrillers that has come out in the last 25 years, if not the most gripping. "Catch Me If You Can" tries to imitate the whole cat and mouse pursuit styles of this movie but while good, CMIYC pales in comparison because "The Fugitive" has such powerful drama, something missing from CMIYC. Don't get me wrong, CMIYC is good in it's own way but pales in comparison. The extras in this "Special Edition" aren't really all that much to write home about and are rather unimpressive and hardly warrant this being called a "Special Edition" and the extra content adds little if anything to an already excellent movie. If you have the older DVD that was available before the special edition came out, you aren't missing out on anything on the newer edition. Despite the unremarkable extras on the "Special Edition" DVD, this movie is definitely one to own as it's one of the best movies that Harrison Ford has starred in outside of the "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" movies. I would also say the same for Tommy Lee Jones as he is at his absolute best on this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AR14BIUHYR6B7.html">AR14BIUHYR6B7</a><br/><p>All right, so this HD-DVD is not home theater demo material.  It still easily surpasses the standard edition upon side by side comparisons.  Yes, there are still some scenes that look like standard DVD, but for the most part, you can see Harrison's beard more clearly as well as many other details.  Perhaps this is a testament to the movie itself...the story is so good you don't simply sit there and marvel at the clarity!  Until another edition comes along to best this latest one ( and you know one will), then this is the one to buy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>If you have somehow missed seeing this terrific action film with Harrison Ford and the inimitable Tommy Lee Jones (he won an Oscar for this role), then waste no time and see it now. It's a terrific update of the popular 1960s TV series of the same name, based on the real-life story of a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife. In one of the most sensational action sequences ever filmed, Ford escapes from a the scene of a horrible wreckage (bus vs. train) as he is enroute in the bus to prison.<br />And off he goes, dodging the law (Jones) at every twist and turn, to find the real killer on his own.<br />Not only is it a great action thriller, however; it's also an intense and spellbinding character study, well-suited to the personalities of the two stars who play so well the roles of hunter and hunted.

I caught this little jewel on the tube recently and quickly was reminded how I sat mesmerized in the theatre back in the early Nineties during THE FUGITIVE's initial release.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are grand fun to watch as a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife (the sensationally gorgeous Sela Ward) flees from the law (while simultaneously identifying the real murderer, don't ya know) and is relentlessly pursued by a pit bull of a U.S. Marshal.  My goodness, we have train wrecks, jumping off of hydro dams, falling through skylights, and much more carnage requiring titanic suspension of disbelief, but come on, Ford plays a doctor who always manages to stitch himself up.<br /><br />The supporting cast is equally fun, led by Joe Pantoliano (one of my fave character actors), Jeroen Krabbe, and Jane Lynch in a very brief role (long, long before 'Glee' fame).  A young and sizzling Julianne Moore also appears as an overwhelmed ER doc.  Sure, the action comes in metric truckloads, but the suspense, plot, and pacing are finely tuned, and Ford and Jones play well off one another.  THE FUGITIVE is one fun rollercoaster; sit on your sofa and hang on.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.6 stars<br /><br />I love this flick, and think both the script and Ford do justice to the original, justifiably beloved tv series. I don't think this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original print, though; while it's a good, crisp picture, it's not much of an improvement over my dvd.<br /><br />The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and the Big Pharma conspiracy angle is an excellent updating that works well. There's thrills aplenty, with minimal violence, which I appreciate more every year as idiot directors and writers rely on guns and blood to fill the holes in their ill-planned plots. There's more intelligence than that at work here, and director Andrew Davis makes it all mesh tightly and suspensefully. The ending is a bit weak: I don't buy the scene at the conference, but it works to the degree it must, and that's good enough.<br /><br />Add Ford and Jones at the top of their games and it's a movie worth watching many times, whenever one needs to be reminded what a truly fine thriller can be.<br /><br />Too bad they didn't polish it up enough for it to be a blu-ray worthy of the description high-def.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>I watched this for the umpteenth time while exercising. Let me tell you, it was effective. Between taking my mind off what I was doing, and raising my adrenaline levels, it made for some intense workouts.<br /><br />It was based on the TV series, which I never saw, so I don't have a basis for comparison.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. Vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford) returns home and finds his wife murdered. He's arrested, tried, and convicted of the crime, but ends up escaping when a prison transport bus crashes. U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is in charge of the task force hunting for him. Dr. Kimball realizes that the only way to help himself is to discover who really killed his wife--the one-armed man--and who's behind it.<br /><br />There's a perfect balance here between chase scenes, suspense, and unraveling clues. The chase scenes and the more static suspense scenes didn't drag on until (as happens far too frequently) I got fatigued, and the detective work by both sides wasn't a series of boring sitting-and-thinking scenes, either.<br /><br />Aside: note to filmmakers: regardless of the type of scene, if it goes on too long, it gets boring (yes, including sex scenes--I've watched enough boring porn movies to know).<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that the movie stars Tommy Lee Jones, either. Or that he fit the role perfectly. As did Harrison Ford. Though Dr. Kimball was a less exciting character, it made sense that he'd behave the way Ford portrayed him--bewildered, angry, completely out of his depth, but smart and determined. So much so that for a space of time I could believe it wasn't a movie at all.<br /><br />It's one of my favorites, and one I don't mind re-watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Few thrillers remain as consistantly thrilling and exciting as "The Fugitive", the 1993 cinematic adaption of the classic television series. Thanks to a fantastic script, excellent directing and two dynamic leads, "The Fugitive" is a masterpiece in every aspect.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble (originally played by the late David Janssen in the tv series), a respected Chciago surgeon who comes home one night to find his wife (Seal Ward) bludgeoned to death, and him framed for her murder. Despite his best efforts, Kimball finds himself convicted for murder and facing wrongful punishment by the law.<br /><br />Not willing to let his wife's murder escape jsutice, Kimball stages a daring escape from a train heading towards a state penitentiary (one of the greatest scenes ever), and becomes the most wanted man in the state.<br /><br />Put in charge of apprehending him is no-nonsense U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, who is determined to bring Kimball to justice.<br /><br />This begins a tense game of cat and mouse that never lets up. Richard manages to evade remais one step ahead of the law and gets closer and closer to finding the true killer, but Gerard will not give up. This leads to one of the most thrillin climaxes in film history.<br /><br />"The Fugitive" is moviemaking at its best, and belongs in all dvd collections.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>I love this film and both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones' portrayals within it.  Most are familiar with the story: a Chicago-based vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kincaid (Ford) returns home to find an intruder and his wife nearly dead from the attack. The CPD cannot substantiate the story and believe the good doctor murdered his wife instead.  Dr. Kincaid is sentenced to death by lethal injection due to the particularly heinous nature of the crime. He gets a lucky break when the inmates on his prisoner transport break out.  Instead of running for the border, Dr. Kincaid returns to Chicago to find the person who killed his wife.  U. S. Marshal Sam Girard is assigned to the case---Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal in this particular film was what spawned his role in "US Marshals" another case where he ends up proving the innocence of the person he is seeking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>When I was a kid I liked to watch "The Fugitive" episodes on TV.  It offered a unique scenario; an (innocent) escaped convict running from a persistent lawman goes from town to town meeting different people with different problems, challenges, asperations, etc.  By the time things are resolved in each episode, Inspector Girard is just close enough for Richard Kimble to flee to a new locale for a new episode.  The possibilities were endless because there were only two characters that were repeaters from one episode to the next.<br /><br />In the movie, this aspect was lost but, in its' place, a more exciting set of circumstances were explored.  The TV version of Richard Kimble was always looking for "the one-armed man" (OK, I guess there were THREE characters that appeared in some or all of the episodes).  However, he never got close enough until the end.  In the movie version, Dr. Richard Kimble is a man possessed and the innocent bystanders were incidental to the pursuit of finding the real killer.  Jettison the human interest stories and focus on the chasee being the chaser and we've got a real action movie.<br /><br />There is nary a dull moment throughout "The Fugitive" all of which is aided by a superb cast.  Tommy Lee Jones deservingly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the Marshall in pursuit.  Harrison Ford produces his customary above average performance and a number of other characters add a lot as well.  The aura of suspense coupled with the search to solve a mystery leads to a great climax.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you stick with when channel surfing.  As good as the TV version was, I recall that I listened to a Twins game the night of the final episode.  Fortunately the scoreboard announced the outcome of the final episode (as well as the game) and the sportcasters relayed it to us listeners.  I think I would opt for the movie over the baseball game if the choice ever comes up.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Sela Ward(tv's Once and Again) is Harrison Ford's(Hollywood Homicide)wife and she is killed....Ford says its the one armed man..but he is thrown on a bus to prison when the bus is taking over and he escapes running threw the woods and dodges cops trying to find the one man who killed his beautiful wife...Tommy Lee Jones(U.S. Marshals) is the man on the hunt for Ford and he will stop at nothing just to get my man..twists and turns take a good ride in a nicely written script..forceful performances make this worth the ride and Ford should of one an award...both him and Jones should of. also starring Tom Wood(Under Siege), Joe Pantoliano(The Matrix) and Julianne Moore(Magnolia)</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>The movie picks up as it goes.

And who doesn't love Tommy Lee Jones (The Client, Men In Black) Harrison Ford (If you don't know one other movie he's in stop reading this review) as adversaries and seeming equals.  Plus the film boasts an up-and-coming Joe Pantoliano (of t.v.'s &quot;The Sopranos&quot; the new CBS drama &quot;The Handler&quot;) as a member of Jones' crack U.S. Marshall unit.<p>The film kicks off as Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is wrongly convicted of his wifes' murder, and escapes when his prison bus crashes and is destroyed by an oncoming train.  Soon on the scene is veteran U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerrard (Jones) to start his relentless hunt for Kimble.<p>What follows is an intense cat and mouse game, with Jones dogging Fords' every step and Ford risking almost certain recapture trying to clear his name.  Gifted Director Andrew Davis and his gifted team of editors and cinematographers take this premise and turn &quot;The Fugitive&quot; into a virtuostic piece of kinetic filmaking.  They stage one surprising and no holds barred chase after another, trying to top themselves at every turn and succeeding most of the time. A huge reason for this is Ford and Jones, the films' soul.  Jones won a deserved Best Supporting Actor oscar for his work playing a terrific hard-ass, and no one is better at playing sympathetic heroes than Harrison Ford, and he pulls out one of his best performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>If any TV series deserved the big screen treatment, it would have to be THE FUGITIVE.  This superb series, which starred the late David Janssen and ran on ABC-TV from 1963 to 1967, was a huge hit on the small screen.  And in 1993, it got to the big screen with excellent results.<p>Taking over from Janssen, Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, who is arrested, tried, and convicted for the murder of his wife Helen (Sela Ward)--a murder that he did not commit.  On the way to an Illinois prison, the bus he and other prisoners are riding in suffers a catastrophic accident and a collision with a train.  Ford manages to escape, but now the feds, under the leadership of U.S. marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), are after him, and they are relentless.  Ford is forced to do whatever it takes to stay just out of the law's reach and not only find the one-armed assailant who actually killed his wife, but also why the murder even happened in the first place.<p>Without an unneccesary amount of graphic violence or out-of-control explosions, director Andrew Davis (UNDER SIEGE) manages to build suspense in the classic Hitchcock tradition.  Indeed, both the film and the TV series upon which it is based are superlative variations on a favorite Hitchcock theme--a man on the run for a crime he didn't commit.  If the plot seems a bit incredulous at times, this is only a minor flaw; and it is easily forgotten just watching Ford piece together a sinister puzzle to prove his innocence to everyone, especially the tenacious, hard-as-nails Jones.<p>Jones won a richly-deserved Oscar for his slightly sardonic performance as Sam Gerard, especially for his line about searching every "warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, and doghouse" after the train wreck.  But it is Ford who really carries this movie.  We sympathize with his plight and we are with him just about every step of the way.  Like Hitchcock's characters, as well as those in Spielberg's movies, we are put into the shoes of Ford's character and forced to think about what we might do if we were ever under the same kind of pressure.<p>THE FUGITIVE is vigorously recommended to anyone who appreciates good, old-fashioned suspense and thrills with believable characters and a believable plot.  Pick it up!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>The Fugitive is a fantastic film. I'm just going to come right out and say that first. It's perfect. It can't be any better than it is. Director Andrew Davis(Under Siege)delivers a high octane action/adventure film that's a great ride from scene one to the end climax. Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble. He's an innocent man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife(Sela Ward). While being transported, the jail van gets in an accident and the good doctor escapes. He's now on the lam trying to find the real killer and to clear his name. Tommy Lee Jones is an F.B.I. marshall after Ford. Jones won the Supporting Oscar for this. He's teriffic. Ford is his usual solid, perfect self. If he isn't the blueprint for the perfect matinee idol, then I don't know who is. This movie holds you from the beginning and never lets go. Julianne Moore pops up in a very brief role. Don't even bother with the sequel &quot;F.B.I. Marshalls&quot;. This is one great classic. A must!.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>I always enjoyed the television series. The movie was just as good. Tommy Lee Jones played his role as a U.S. Marshall to the hilt. Harrison Ford was above average in his role as the wrongly accused doctor. The bus being hit  by the train was a unique special effects act. The plot of this movie was  outstanding as well. This movie even had the one armed man as the killer  just like the series that was on television. The associate of Dr. Kimbell's  being a party to the murder was another<p>unique twist.

But he still  turns in a great performance(It was worth an oscar nomination if you ask  me). But it is Tommy Lee Jones who steals this movie he steals every scene  he is in and he deserved his academy award.

He escapes from the authorities and instead of fleeing and hiding he sets out to prove his innocence and find the people responsible for his wife's death.  He knows that a one armed man was involved and killed his wife; the only problem is how to find him.<br /><br />Everyone thinks Kimble is guilty and all the evidence points to him trying to collect on insurance money. He escapes when other prisoners try to escape.  He has no choice as he is convicted to death row.  Something is strange about Kimble as when he is escaping he saves the life of one of the guards of the prison bus.  True criminals don't behave that way.<br /><br />US Marshalls are called in to capture the escaped prisoners and Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is the head man in the effort to find Kimble....<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie featuring and all-star cast.  This remake of a television series was a smash hit and it is really worth the time and effort to get a copy and watch.  Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford just make this movie something special.

Appropriately acerbic, sarcastic and caring.<br />Jones' team of marshals is perfect. The characters are distinct and fleshed out. No unnecessary redundancies in characterization.<br /><br />One satisfying twist on the "chase movie" cliche is that the antagonist, Gerard, is not actually the bad guy.

Instead of the bi-plane that flies into and causes the gas tanker to explode with Cary Grant racing from the scene, we've got the mother of all train wrecks which Harrison Ford literally leaps from a nanosecond prior to impact!<br /><br />THERE IS A LOT MORE TO 'THE FUGITIVE' THAN JUST CHASE SCENES<br /><br />Richard Kimble did not kill his wife. We knew that when we entered the theatre because we had all heard of the TV series by that name and some of us even saw the hourly mystery program when it ran in the 1960s. We knew about the one-armed man, the conviction of Dr. Kimble, and his quest to prove that a one-armed man had committed the horrific deed.<br /><br />'THE FUGITIVE' DELIVERS SURPRISES + SUSPENSE & RESOLUTION TOO<br /><br />Somehow this seemingly very tired theme came alive and grabbed my attention very early. Although I found the opening sequence a bit lurid and disturbing, it was captivating nevertheless. With an obvious sense of pacing, the trial of Dr. Richard Kimble was as rapid [on-screen] as a disclosure of the basic facts of Mrs. Kimble's murder allowed.<br /><br />From Kimble's conviction, we are jettisoned to the biggest and most visceral TRAIN WRECK sequence I have ever seen on film. More importantly, it established sympathy for Kimble as he not only barely escaped death, but he saved one of the guards in the process. This incredible action sequence led directly to the introduction of Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Marshall Sam Gerard and the unbelievable chase scenes that followed.<br /><br />The action sequences and suspense are so genuine that even the mundane scenes, like when Kimble was going through the one-armed man's private papers, were intense. No matter how many times I watch this film, I am amazed by how enthralled I am with the action and characters, despite knowing the complete storyline. I dare say that even the Master of Suspense himself couldn't have done better!<br /><br />----- THE ACTORS -<br /><br />Harrison Ford - Dr. Richard Kimble<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones - Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard<br /><br />Sela Ward - Helen Kimble<br /><br />Joe Pantoliano - Cosmo Renfro<br /><br />Jeroen Krabbe - Dr. Charles Nichols<br /><br />Julianne Moore - Dr. Anne Eastman<br /><br />Andreas Katsulas - Sykes "One Armed Man"<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: SPECIAL EDITION - WIDESCREEN - DIGITAL TRANSFER<br /><br />Digital transfer in Widescreen.

The police take the husband in for questioning. They had been at an event, and Dr. Kimble was called to the hospital, leaving his wife alone. There was an attack by a one-armed man; his wife's death leaves him rich. Dr. Kimble is convicted for her murder and sentenced to death. (This is based on the 1960s TV series.) The surprise in this movie is not in the ending, but the events that lead to the ending. The legend of a Doctor wrongly convicted is based on the real case of Dr. Sam Sheppard.<br /><br />As an action suspense story, this is excellent! It is set in the Chicago area, probably because Cleveland would have no part of this story. Marshall Gerard shows up to personally take over the investigation, and search for the fugitive. Dr. Kimble's escape in cold weather reminds me of the similar escape of Rambo. Dr. Kimble hides in the urban jungle. The pacing keeps the fugitive one jump ahead of his pursuers. When he is trapped in the tunnel, Dr. Kimble goes underground (literally). Gerard is relentless for a man who "doesn't care". Dr. Kimble escapes with a desperate leap into the air. We then follow Dr. Kimble as he attempts to search for the real killer, like in a detective story.<br /><br />This story was updated to reflect the business world of the 1990s, and its many scandals. Professional rivalry could not be mentioned in the 1960s. This is a film that can be watched and enjoyed every year. I wonder if that ethnic neighborhood was chosen for some significance? The parade in the street reminded me of the scene in "Blow Out" or "The Net". The film does not tell of Dr. Kimble's future. Will Dr. Kimble face the same problems that Dr. Sheppard faced after his acquittal? We hope not.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford), convicted of killing his wife Helen, on his way to be executed in Southern Illinois, has a lucky bus accident and escapes to a hospital. Enter Sam Gerard (Jones), who literally steals the show with his flip one-liners throughout the film: My my my...what a mess; We got a gopher; Richard, do you wanna get shot?!; S.o.b. our boy came home, etc. Gerard hounds Kimble ruthlessly all the way back home to Chicago. The scenes that stand out are the start of the chase, the tunnel standoff, the encounter at the hotel. Richard finds a one-armed man killed Helen and breaks into his apartment to find more dirt and encounters him on the el-train en route to confront the mastermind of the murder, his best friend Dr. Charles Nichols. A clever man, Richard eludes Sam and his lawmen by hiding out in child molester apt. and posing as an Hispanic janitor doing medical work. Clearly the best action movie of the 1990s, as excellent acting portrayals by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>What makes &quot;The Fugitive&quot; such a successful and superior film is that it knows what it is: an action/mystery film. It makes no attempt to make itself bigger or more intellectual than it is (as did the American version of &quot;The Vanishing&quot;). Harrison Ford, surprisingly underplaying the role of Dr. Kimball--others might have overworked his grief and angst--turns in a brilliant performance. And the always reliable Tommy Lee Jones does an icy, sparkling job as Kimball's persuer, US Marshal Sam Gerard. So good a performance that he earned a well-deserved Oscar for it.<p>The other key to the movie's success is Andrew Davis' dazzling direction. He keeps the pace frenetic for a good deal of the film, and the pot is always kept boiling. Close calls and intense chases keep the tension and suspense at fever pitch. &quot;The Fugitive&quot; will endure for a long time as a classic action thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Harrisson Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are a action duo match made in heaven.  This film ROCKS.  The action is non stop and the tenstion of the &quot;who dunnit&quot; question is always hanging in the air.  The plot is one of the most heartpounding and thrilling I have ever watched.  The cinematography is really shot well.  The villain comes out of nowhere, and even the keenest mind will be surprised when you figure it out.  Julianne Moore makes a breakthrough role as the suspicious doctor in the hospital scene.  This film in a sense reminds me of the old cop TV series, because you are always wondering if Harrison Ford can ger out of the predicament he is in.  I highly reccomend this film for any action buff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>I am torn between four stars and five stars. Generally, to earn five stars from me, it has to be a movie that I could see many times, even in one week. This movie does not qualify for that. Although it is very good, I can only watch it once every six months or so. However, since it really is good, it should qualify as five stars, especially compared to other four star movies.<p>The acting is good, the cinematography is great, the transfer is very good (especially considering it was one of the early DVDs to hit the market) and the special effects are good enough that you hardly notice them (which is what I consider good -- you don't notice that they are there).<p>The suspense is high in that you don't know if he will get caught (no, I won't tell you). There are small surprises at every turn, but not enough depth to bear rapid repeat viewings. Still, it is one of the modern day classics, so give it a try.</p></br></body></html>

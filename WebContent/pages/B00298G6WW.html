The relationship between the Denver businessman and the hit man becomes the theme of the story.<br />I didn't really much like the movie, how it was filmed or the plot, but the actibg was pretty good overall.

He demonstrates great breath and ability in this movie.  He is still that "James Bond" ladies man, but it has to be because of his smooth talking (and his bankroll).<br /><br />My complaint is the ending.  I don't want to write anything here to ruin it for you, but there is something placed under a window wiper.  It has significance.  Is it something the assassin is giving up?  Is it the equivalent of a business card?  If it was spontaneous, is it one t***** or two?  What did I miss here?  What?

I generally like both Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear and had heard alot of praise over this film so I was anxious to see it. Maybe I would have liked it better if I hadn't built up such hig expectations, but I doubt it.<br /><br />Plot: While on a business trip to Mexico City Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) strikes up a conversation with (Julian Noble) Pierce Brosnan in a bar late one night just before closing.

Danny must decide if Julian is really a friend worth helping.<br /><br />The acting of both Brosnan and Kinnear is top notch, but the storyline just didn't work for me.

On a business trip to Mexico, he meets an interesting stranger in the hotel bar, a man named Julian...who happens to be a burned-out assassin.  As the two become friends, things become complicated, as Julian becomes more and more unreliable; and soon, the two friends will have to work together to save Julian's life...AND their friendship...<br /><br />"The Matador" is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen lately.  Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, and Hope Davis all give outstanding performances; the writing is crisp and clever, the pace fast, the dialogue believable, the characters genuinely likeable and relatable.  Rarely does a movie this engaging come along.  "The Matador" is a uniquely touching, witty, suspenseful movie that--thanks in large part to brilliant acting performances and an interesting concept--draws its viewers in and doesn't let them go until the final credit crosses the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`The Matador', while not the greatest movie of 2005 due to the slim plotline, is executed with enough charm and wit to make it a memorable movie experience, one that can be enjoyed more than once.  A few people have noted the strong sexual content in the film, and to them I say "read the back of the disc"...it clearly states `Rated R for strong sexual content and language' so don't complain about what you already knew.  If that sort of thing offends you then you shouldn't have rented the movie.<br /><br />That off my chest, this film, as I mentioned, is saved from being forgettable by a brilliantly funny and heartwarming script that couldn't have been better executed.  The charm and wit of the film come from none other than our pair of stars, Pierce Bosnan and Greg Kinnear, who couldn't have been better suited for the task.  The two actors play off each other with such genuine warmth and such natural comfortableness that you never see Greg and Pierce but only Danny (Kinnear) and Julian (Bosnan).<br /><br />The film opens with Julian finishing a job.  Julian is a `facilitator of fatalities' or in human terms a hitman, working for corporate businesses and killing for lots of money, making certain people disappear to help business deals go through.  Julian is a crude, rude, perverted, horny, (I think somewhat bi-sexual) man who hasn't a friend in the world, but an address book full of acquaintances.  He has a boss (Philip Baker Hall) who views him as expendable and a personality that usually pushes others far away.  That was until he met Danny, a struggling salesman who's in Mexico on business the same time as Julian.  They meet by chance in a bar, and after a few uncomfortable moments (Julian makes a pass at Danny which is downright hilarious) and a few kind words, the two part ways on not so nice terms.  Over the course of the weekend though the two do become friends and share a secret that ensures their permanent friendship.<br /><br />Six months later Julian shows up on Danny's doorstep.  Danny's wife Bean (Hope Davis) is both mortified and curious of their new houseguest, but it's not Bean Julian is interested in.  You see Julian has screwed up.  He's burnt himself out and botched a few jobs and now his agency wants him dead.  There's just one catch.  If he completes one last job he's off, clean and clear.  But he can't do this alone.  He needs Danny's help.<br /><br />And that's all I'm going to tell you.  You're better off watching the rest to find out for yourself how it all goes.  It's funny and touching and entertaining til the very end.  Pierce Brosnan was snubbed royally at the Oscar's this year for his portrayal of the lonely, desperate, over worked and under loved Julian is priceless and a masterclass of acting talent, and Greg is really starting to prove that his nomination in '97 was not a mere fluke but that he really did deserve it.  Great movie from start to finish so check it out...if it won't offend you!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>I have always enjoyed Pierce Brosnan. I never really thought he was the best James Bond, but he did well in the roll...if that makes any sense. Either way, you understand that he is always the cool Brit chick-magnet. In The Matador, there is a small twist on that as he has a strong penchant towards booze and loose women. Not only does Julian Noble lack the class of James Bond, but he may be completely devoid of tact as well. He is a loose cannon and completely socially awkward. For 22 years he has enjoyed a career that has kept him in total isolation from other people's personal lives. Or more so that it has been his personal life that has remained in isolation.<br /><br />Things have changed. While in Mexico on a job, he has a startling realization that he has no friends. Drunk and lonely he stumbles into the hotel bar and finds an unsuspecting Greg Kinnear character (Danny). This poor man, who is nervously waiting to hear back from the company he just pitched for business, breaks the commandment of thou shalt not be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is the first friendly face Julian has come across since he realized he had no friendly faces in his life and he is immediately labeled "friend."<br /><br />The unlikely duo plays the get-to-know-you game for a little while before Julian oversteps his boundaries by asking Danny to help him on a job. Julian asks Danny to help him kill a man. Pulling the trigger or distracting body guards, there is no difference to Danny who wants no part of Julian's business in Mexico, a decision from which we are shown the seeming end of the friendship. Until Julian shows up on Danny's doorstep in Colorado.<br /><br />For a few days Danny stayed in Mexico in case the company whose business he sought needed to hear his pitch a second time, and over those few days he shared a few drinks with a man who kills people for a living, a man with no one else to turn to when he is at his wit's end. Julian needs a friend again and with no one else to turn to, he gives Danny the choice to help or turn his back.<br /><br />Brosnan and Kinnear play an odd-couple of sorts, two personalities who could hardly be more different. I would argue that they did not have good chemistry together, but that was the whole point. I believe every interaction between Julian and Danny was supposed to be as uncomfortable for the viewers as it was for Danny. That was mission accomplished.<br /><br />I liked where the movie started. I liked where it was going. I did not like where it ended up. The final scene was the best way they could have ended the movie, but it was the conflict resolution I did not like. I liked the Julian Noble character, but the movie would have been better had it been about all of the years he was the best at what he did. Remove the conflict in The Matador and let Julian do what he does best with a camera over his shoulder. Give me a The Matador prequel and I bet you sell more tickets.<br /><br />The movie was luke warm. You would be ok to see it at someone else's request, but you needn't actively seek out The Matador.  For good Pierce Brosnan cinema, stick to Thomas Crown Affair and The Tailor of Panama.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I love a beard on a guy. Not a big curly beard, but a nice bit of stubble, just adds a certain je nais sais quoi (or however you spell it.) Give me a bit of stubble rash anyday. It's always worth it. Guys always look sexier.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan & Greg Kinnear both sport moustaches in this movie. Do either of them look good? No. It looks like something's died underneath their noses.<br /><br />It doesn't detract from the movie in my opinion, it was distracting. Pierce plays the role of a hitman excellently, all he needed was an hoop earring, and he would have been the perfect sleazy guy. Just everything he did, from winking at underage girls, to dancing with 'Bean', was just ultimately creepy. At the beginning we see him waking up in bed with a naked woman, he has a wee peek under the covers, and then paints his toenails the same colour as hers. I know weird.<br /><br />It's pretty much a 'buddy' movie. Pierce & Greg play off against each other brilliantly as Julian and Danny respectively. Their relationship progresses, falls by the wayside, and then starts up again. They're very much the odd couple, but yet it does work. I thought Pierce was brilliant, and Greg, although a little dodgy at points, was good and a good calm to Pierce's unpredictability. I did feel it dragged a bit in the middle, just a little, but not in a lengthy way, where you get bored of the movie thankfully.<br /><br />The Matador is sadly forgettable, and not that impressive at points. It's a great movie to watch, but it's over before you know it, and then you forget about it. But it is a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>MATADOR was going along very well and then just seemed to die. It is as if the script writer or writers just couldn't figure out how to end this movie. Even as a parody of a movie about a hit man (Pierce Brosnan), it has one of the wimpiest endings I've seen. Until the last half hour, however, we have here a pretty good film. Mr. Brosnan plays a zany contract killer and his effort in MATADOR reminds me of George Clooney's off-the-wall performance in O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? The same focus on odd hair, loony smile and absurd speechifying. It is a terrific performance by Brosnan, who adopts a regular citizen (Greg Kinnear) as his friend and brings him into his sinister world. This is a kind of buddy flick with women playing peripheral roles. MATADOR has slick production values and is quite entertaining. Until the last half hour, that is. One will need to overlook some ideas about contract killing that might disturb if taken out from the dark of the theater and examined in the light of morality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>The Matador is about an assassin who has been working for a mysterious Mr. Stick for 22 years. Julian "facilitates fatalities". He asks no questions,gets the job done, and moves on waiting for the next assignment or package while traipsing 'round the globe.Julian has no home address.He has no home.Period.Until he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico while completing an assignment and enjoying a little r&r afterwards(fiestas, siestas,bars,sex shops,matador fights)---he's done with his job early. They soon develop a most interesting male bonding friendship/relationship (nope, this ain't BrokeBack Mountain territory folks)!Let me explain. Danny Wright (Kinnear)is the average American hardworking Joe in the world of corporate sales who as the frontman for the business through  pitches tries to keep the profits and contracts coming in (can you say job security?). He has a loving devoted wife back in Denver and a warm and inviting, cozy home(not a house). He is the poster child or man for the middle to upper middle working class in America. Julian Noble is a slightly crusty, paunchy,sad and lonely, miserable burned out assassin who befriends Danny while in Mexico and vice versa. Danny embodies everything that Julian wishes he had , and , no, not the material things;things that even the blood money he's made can't buy him! The friendship between both men starts off rocky and very unlikely to succeed or continue. Julian is crude,rude, and uncouth (he doesn't give a crap or take crap---so, you would think)Yet,ironically, he possesses this intelligent worldly aura from his experiences in literally globe trotting for his job or jobs over the years.He's got a penchant for boozing it up and a strong hankering for almost every skirt that passes him by(even for the younger ones that may be unsettling for those who watch the film)! Danny is the extreme opposite of who and what Julian is.Complete antithesis. Though, Danny himself is far from perfect, has his own personal issues and is very much human(frailties, strenghts)... Let's fast forward. Julian's burn out has finally caught up with him after botching yet another job(age?conscience? change of heart? life re-evaluation? all of the above? ya think?). He's now the target of his boss!...How does Danny fit into the equation? Go see The Matador.<br /><br />The Matador is such a befitting title for this film. Literally, matador in Spanish means killer or assassin. So, there really is no "symbolic" meaning in reference to Brosnan's character Julian Noble.It's a literal translation in Spanish for the word describing his "profession" and who he is. Bet a lot of folks thought, "Oh, how exotic in comparing Brosnan's role to a Spanish or Mexican matador!". That said, I saw the film last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! It feels and plays out like an adult, mature comedy for mature audiences. If you're expecting 100 jokes and laughs a minute or anything bordering into teen humor movies, you won't get it here (except for maybe a couple of sex scenes that don't add or detract from the film) !<br /><br />Whether speculation is that Pierce Brosnan is poking fun at his former Bond glory days or not doesn't matter.Who cares ?... It's great to see him in a dark comical role (though a true-life assassin is anything BUT comical).It showed another facet to his multi-talented abilities. Nothing worse for an actor than to be typecasted over and over until it just becomes a parody of that type of said role---the suave and debonair agent or spy.His execution(no pun) of biting and sarcastic comical wit and timing was awesome. Also, the great element of comical surprise was hearing Brosnan utter both funny and filthy lines in some scenes when you least expected it(element of good surprise indeed). Brosnan and Kinnear's acting chemistry was great;The New Odd Couple of the 21st Century?Could be.  Actress Hope Davis as 'Bean'was also wisely casted as the wife of Greg Kinnear's character. I kept looking at her and thinking she reminded me of Callista Flockheart for her wholesome acting persona--- but a slightly more rounder and healthier looking Flockhart!She may have that sweet naive expression at times but she's sharper and wittier than you think. She contributes well to the overall humorous atmosphere. Greg Kinnear is, well in Greg Kinnear acting territory. The always likeable and trustworthy guy who can be so gullible at times! Again, even his humorous or comical streak works in great sync with Brosnan's!<br /><br />Keep an open mind that the premise or story is whacky, ludicrous, whatever you want to call it and you'll have a great time. Don't expect Brosnan to go completely into Billy Bob Thornton character antics (Bad Santa).Yet, don't count on Pierce to do his Bond antics either(been there, done that).There's a faint or slight  comical wit akin to his early Remington Steele days on television where even that character had a strong underlying funny bone in him at times. What The Matador does is it serves as the perfect vehicle in showcasing Brosnan's brilliant comedy acting talent with other emotional ranges as well that makes him the bonafide (not Bond-afied) actor he is; An actor who truly takes risks and succeeds flawlessly!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>I see this movie being characterized as an "offbeat buddy comedy"...OK offbeat - yes, buddies - sort of, comedy - uh NO! Right off the bat I'm gonna tell you there is nothing funny about this movie so dont be misled like I was.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan plays a "facilitator", a sometimes charming, sometimes manic corporate assassin at the end of his career, and on the road to alcohol fueled burnout and total psychological breakdown. After 22 years in the "business" on the eve of his birthday, we see him in a lonely Mexico City hotel room frantically dialing random phone numbers of strangers he's collected around the globe who either dont remember who he is, or conveniently forget, driving him further into the bottle.<br /><br />Meanwhile a struggling businessman from Denver, Greg Kinnear, is celebrating what he thinks is a successful pitch to a local company (hahaha wait hahahahahahaha we are in Mexico City arent we? hahahahahaha) and is joined by a kneewalkin' Brosnan in the hotel bar over a couple of margaritas. One tequila too many, and Kinnear is insulted by a viciously drunk Brosnan, and walks out of the bar only to find his trip home will be delayed because his client is having second thoughts. Hmmmn?<br /><br />The next day Brosnan is able to recapture his previous nite's contact with Kinnear, makes amends, and they elect to retire to a bullfight where Brosnan later confesses to his new pal what he does for a living.<br /><br />Aside from being fairly humorless, this is a somewhat disturbing and semi-bleak character study. And you would expect a flick about a hired killer to involve some level of intrigue but there's none of that to be found either, particularly after two blown assignments his own crew turns on him making it known that he is next. But there's no near misses, no harrowing escapes, no betrayals or plot twists that you might expect. Instead, after months on the run and and elapsed time of 2 minutes, Brosnan merely shows up at Kinnear's home late one night to share a bottle of bad Irish whiskey, dance with his wife, and show off his .38 which no self respecting killer would ever carry in the first place. The climax is totally absurd with Mr. Everyday Everyguy going out on a mission with our reluctant assassin and gleefully volunteering to risk everything he owns by becoming an accessory to murder.<br /><br />A nice DVD package with terrific 5.1 audio, but this movie is highly overated. Brosnan's performance is the clear highlight of the film, however uncomfortable he may make you, and even that gets tiresome by the fourth act. 3 Trees</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Looks like Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) an out of work salesman is making a come back in Mexico City.

After a shaky greeting they exchange job information and become friends.<br /><br />The question is where does this friendship lead and what do we learn form it?"<br /><br />The title comes from a scene at a bullfight which is used as a metaphor.<br /><br />The story can be scene again in essence in the movie "Real Men" (1987) which contains a little S&M but not as sleazy as this version..</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Matador" is excellent!

This film reveals him as the anti-James Bond, a creepy assassin who suddenly grows a conscience in his waning years. No more REMINGTON STEELE, no more 007. This guy needs a serious injection of scruples.<br /><br />When Julian Noble (Brosnan) is assigned to "rub someone out," there's no hope for his target. That is until one day he's contracted to take out a man in Manila and has a nervous breakdown, ending up face-down in a pile of donkey dung.<br /><br />Then we move on to/flashback to Mexico City, where Julian meets up with Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear, ), a down-on-his-luck businessman who tries to befriend Julian in the hotel bar. But Julian's antisocial behavior gets in the way often and nearly forces Danny away. But they form a sort of twisted friendship and Julian takes Danny into his confidence while watching a bullfight and shows him how to function as a killer. Danny is both terrified and exhilarated.<br /><br />Then, six months later, Julian shows up at Danny's house in Denver and ask for an impossible favor.<br /><br />________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Brosnan deserves an Oscar for his performance as the confused and embattled assassin. I never, ever, ever saw Brosnan but always the character he was portraying. He completely creeped me out, even when some of his humanity returned.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear was excellent as Brosnan's alter-ego, a Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes guy who needs an infusion of toughness to get his life back on track. The film is strange like that, too. Both men give some of themselves to the other, but in the process lose a portion of what they once were. For Brosnan's character, that was definitely a good thing all the way around, but for Kinnear's, we're not too sure.<br /><br />The scenes filmed in Mexico were beautifully filmed, too. The shots of the colorful buildings, the huge stadium built for bullfighting, the cheesy bars, etc.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie that'll tickle that dark funny bone, you couldn't go wrong here. Brosnan is masterful!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Julian Noble (a witty, debauched, ironic Pierce Brosnan) is a hit-man for hire and at a crossroads in his life: after years of killing for money, bedding anything within sight and inhaling as much liquor as he can, Julian is having trouble carrying off his assignments. Has he developed a conscience? Is he bored? Does he no longer need the money? It's never really made clear but "The Matador" is one of those films in which the journey is much more fun and important than the destination.<br /><br />Along the way, Julian hooks up with a nebbish Danny Wright (a perfect Greg Kinnear) and Danny's wife (Hope Davis) both of whom hilariously accept Julian at face value: they are both excited and turned on by Julian's occupation and welcome him into their home for conversation, bourbon and pecan pie.<br /><br />Director Richard Shepard keeps a tight rein on the proceedings and though much of the action has to be seen to be believed, the film rarely bogs down in its own absurdity.<br /><br />The revelation of "The Matador" is of course Pierce Brosnan and, with this part, he once and for all sheds any notion in anyone's mind that he can only play James Bond. His Julian is paunchy, grizzled, graying and fun as hell to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Now this is an unusual and quite enjoyable movie, with Pierce Brosnan like you've never seen before and with Greg Kinnear giving a hilarious and touching performance, best for both in a long time. I loved the quirky conversations, the no bs jokes, the bright color schemes, the glow of cardamom yellow, aqua and flame red in the background, flower beds and their drinks. This movie is full of flavor, shades and produces quite a few chuckles, but also has some nice moments that make it an enjoyable experience and gives a sense of satisfaction at the end.<br /><br />Brosnan plays Julian Noble, an assassin that meets up with Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in a bar in Mexico. Those two are as far from normal life style as possible in an exotic place; one just finished a "job" while the other has a semi successful business deal in the works. Julian finds out that it's his birthday and realizes he has no friends. As a secret killer, a hush hush man, he starts chatting with Danny at a bar and buys him a drink. The whole time the audience is made to wonder if he really wants to be friends or is Danny his next job.  They talk and laugh, hit some rough spots, they get angry at each other, they laugh more, its back and forth like a husband and wife after thirty years of marriage. They argue all the time but they can't stay away from each other. They go to see a bull fight, that has a profound impact on their "friendship" when the bull fighter delivers the kill, Julian tells Danny who he is and what he does. He then proceeds to give him a hilarious demonstration of his talents.<br /><br />I had a blast watching this, with fine performances from all the actors, witty dialog, jokes and offences, and scruffy, unshaven Brosnan, who paraded around in funky clothes and spoke words I never heard him utter. We watched him trot the globe form Budapest to Vienna, Mexico and Us to Danny's home and the trials and tabulations his failing career caused him. Once he's too tired to work, his midlife crisis hits him, he has no friends but Danny to help him out as his own boss it out to terminate the old dog, Julian himself. Half the fun was watching Kinnear and Brosnan collaborate, as they make a fine match, indescribable by words. It's a feast for the eyes and a holiday for my mind and a fun Thursday night movie to watch with someone close to share the laughs and gasps.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F7CCPK4QL359.html">A2F7CCPK4QL359</a><br/><p>Pierce Brosnan has previously  played Remmington Steele and James Bond. In this  film, he plays a hapless hit man who lost his nerve to kill. This black comedy takes a large poke at the Steele/Bond legends that Brosnan have already done and made famous. Brosnan does this satire  with a flair<br /><br />When he loses his nerve, he chats with a simple man in a bar (Greg Kinnear). Kinnear's character reminds me of Albert Brooks's character from the bad remake of the IN-Laws..that is where the similar ideas ends. He befriends Bronson in his hour of need<br /><br /> Kinnear's wife is played by Hope Davis. This role is most lifelike I have seen Davis act since she did the role of Joyce in the film American Spendor<br /><br />To give away the end would spoil the fun..just get it and enjoy it yourself<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>If there ever was any doubt that Pierce Brosnan would have a career, "Post-007", this engaging, dark comedy/drama should put them to rest. Not only is he brilliant, as a seedy, 'past-his-prime' hitman, but he compliments each of his co-stars' performances, giving Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, and Philip Baker Hall equal opportunities to shine, in their scenes together. It is a totally captivating performance from an actor truly in touch with his craft.<br /><br />The story is simple enough; after 22 years of performing paid assassinations, drinking and fornicating prodigiously, and maintaining a "Who gives a damn?" attitude about life, in general, Julian Noble (Brosnan) starts making mistakes, seeing himself as a child in his targets, and losing his 'edge'. Being the intellectually shallow person he is, he makes excuses, but he is well aware that his own life might be in jeopardy if he can't straighten himself out, on a 'hit' in Mexico...enter Greg Kinnear as a sales rep who desperately needs a successful meeting with clients in Mexico, is still coping with the loss of a child, and with his loving, if grieving wife (Hope Davis), who is also attempting to fill the void in her own life. After a rocky first meeting, Brosnan 'connects', emotionally, with Kinnear, discovering someone who finds his life as dangerous and romantic as he once thought it was, himself; while Kinnear, ever a 'straight-arrow', finds himself seduced by the gregarious, 'larger-than-life' Brosnan, opening his eyes to an exciting, 'taboo' world. The 'healing' each would provide the other (and that Brosnan would provide an equally intrigued Davis), lifts this film far beyond films with a similar concept ("The Whole Nine Yards", for example).<br /><br />Brosnan is truly a revelation, making a less-than-admirable protagonist into a character you actually care about, and Kinnear and Davis show a rebirth through their relationship with him that is both believable, and very funny, as well. The 'hits', while shown, are presented in a detached manner, focusing more on the mechanics than on the morality (morality is not the issue of this film; Brosnan's 'visions' are not an issue of conscience, in my opinion, but of a spiritual and physical exhaustion). This film is ultimately a story of three 'lost souls' bonding to 'move on' in their lives.<br /><br />Vastly entertaining, if occasionally crude (Brosnan is far removed from his sophisticated 007 persona), "The Matador" deserves the great reviews it has received, and is certainly worth a spot in your film library!</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>When I saw the preview for this movie I just had to see it. I don't know why but it just looked funny and entertaining. Maybe it was seeing Brosnan acting like a complete nut in every scene. The movie is about a bored and lonely assassin Julian Noble (Brosnan) who ends up stalking a traveling salesman named Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear). The thing is that Julian met Danny at a bar in Mexico and likes his personality so now he wants to be friends. Julian has bigger problems though like he can't finish his jobs because he freezes up every time he tries to pull the trigger.<br /><br />Because of this his boss has put out a hit on him so Julian leaves Mexico and shows up on Danny's front door step. What makes matters worse is not only is Julian having a mid life crisis but he has terrible manners and has a problem drinking too much. Danny has to put up with his craziness while trying to spend time with his wife on christmas. Julian finally tells Danny why he really came to his home and tells him he needs his help to complete with his last job. The two set out on a very exciting and funny journey to rescue Julian from death and send him to a relaxing paradise to retire in.<br /><br />What I like most about The Matador is the comedy that couldn't have been accomplished without Brosnans hysterical but fitting look. He played Julian on point and really got the comedic depressing feeling of his character. The story has a pretty good twist to it but nothing too surprising. You might even guess the end before it gets there as it bites off some other more serious assassin films. The cast did a good job but for some reason you could feel something missing. One more character equally as crazy as Julian Noble or even crazier maybe could have gave the movie that extra something. It has great picture and sound quality, definitely no problems there. Basically The Matador didn't really have flaws but it was just a 4 star performance. From the story to the comedy it was 4 stars, as funny as it is it isn't 5 star bust out crying laughing. If you have time go get it or maybe it's still on TV but this will most likely be enjoyed.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a hitman who is burned out and trying to get out of the business.  In Mexico City, he meets Danny Wright (Kinnear), and makes a poor impression.  Determined to make up for it, he takes Danny to a bullfight the next day.  There, Julian confesses to Danny that he is a hitman, and tells Danny how to go about making a hit to convince him he  is telling the truth.  The two part ways, only to meet again months later when Julian shows up at Danny's house in Denver looking for help.<br /><br />That is a fairly simple description of a very funny movie.  Brosnan is doing his best to shed the James Bond image that he has cultivated over the last decade, and he succeeds.  Kinnear is the straight man, an average Joe., and is believeable in the role.  Danny and Julian's friendship is believeable, and that is what makes the movie work.  All in all, "The Matador" is an entertaining buddy film that has a lot of humor.  Fans of either of the stars will not be disappointed, and I recommend the film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>This smart little buddy flick is not the average buddy flick, that's for sure.  It has some unique avenues to explore (not the least of which is the profession of the main character) and it does so with a visual sense of flare and excitement.<br /><br />This is a happy movie, believe it or not.<br /><br />The film centers around a hit man and a business man filled with desperation who happen to make an unlikely partnership.  They meet in Mexico, at a bar, and seem to hit it off; both men seeking out a sense of companionship (or intimacy).  Six months later Julian (the hit man) shows up at Danny's home, seeking out his help with a job that he just can't seem to complete.  What happened in Mexico plays a large part in Julian's uninvited visit (trying to figure that one out before they tell you can lead to some pretty strange ideas), and it is because of those `events' that Danny agrees to help.<br /><br />Forget about the `hit' though, this movie isn't really about that.<br /><br />Thanks to some extraordinary (and unexpected) performances from the two leads, this little character study tends to make the most of its plot to create something that feels poignant and engaging.  There are moments where it doesn't quite work, or it doesn't feel as powerful as they want it to feel, but overall it is a very engaging and entertaining ride, from start to finish.  I love they way that they weaved an unexpected mystery through the plot, leaving you wondering almost constantly just how everything was going to a) tie together and b) wind up.<br /><br />That's called smart.<br /><br />The biggest reason to see this movie though, is none other than Pierce Brosnan.  I like him, and always have, but he's never really done anything that made me go "wow".  I first saw this movie back in '05 and I still remember him like it were yesterday (well, I rewatched it a few nights ago, but still).  He is just fantastic here.  His comedic timing is outstanding, and the way he paints a very real, very relatable presence, despite the outlandishness of it all, is totally commendable.  His ease with each scene, chewing scenery without ever appearing over-the-top or baity, is something rare.  While I can't really fault Oscar's lineup that year (I have not seen `Good Night and Good Luck' but Phoenix, Hoffman, Howard and Ledger were all very good performances) I would certainly have given Brosnan a nomination had I had the power.  His seethingly hilarious performance is the stuff of comedic dreams (and the layers of dramatic intensity are just as effortless and believable).<br /><br />Kinnear is great too, but Brosnan really just takes the cake for me.<br /><br />In the end I give this an enthusiastic B grade.  I really liked it and would readily watch it again.  It is funny and suspenseful and carries an odd form of charm that makes this film thoroughly entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was just hilarious the first time I saw it. Pierce Brosnan shines and shows that he is more than just 007. He was hilarious as the sleazy assassin going thru a midlife crisis.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to just about any adult that likes good slighty naughty humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Funny, engaging comedy that grabs you from the get go! For once Brosnan doesn't play a suave, drop dead gorgeous ladies man. Instead we see Brosnan play a successful, middle aged, psychopathic hitman with no home life, family, or friends to speak of! His career is all he has and he goes from country to country living from hotel to hotel assassinating those his employer wants him to eliminate.<br /><br />Near the start of this movie, we find both Brosnan's character  and Greg Kinnear's character in Mexico City, Mexico on business. Kinnear plays the role of a mild manner/straight-laced business/family man. Both men are going through a mid-life crisis of sorts as Kinnear's character is on a new business venture and Brosnan's character begins to realize that he is a VERY LONELY middle-aged man with no place to call home.<br /><br />The two begin to form a unique friendship during their time in Mexico City. Brosnan's character later reveals to Kinnear's character that he is an assasin, which Kinnear's character doesn't believe. By the end of their stay in Mexico City, the two are no longer speaking to each other as Brosnan's character has no social skills to maintain a friendship.<br /><br />In the end, Brosnan's character shows up at Kinnear's home in Denver in need of help! He has been failing at his job miserably and is about to be assassinated by his employer for failing to do his job. So, Kinnear comes to the rescue and helps his friend out. I don't want to spoil the ending, so your on you own! Highly recommend this witty movie that holds you attention from start to finish!!</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>Peirce really suprised me in this movie.  He was always so "pretty" in his movies, he showed that he can play "dirty".  An unlikely "friendship" developes between a regular guy and a hired killer.  Pierce, the hired killer, is getting older and less steady on the trigger, could it be that years of murdering is weighing heavy on his concience, or that he is close to his retirement years and dosen't have a  real friend in this whole stinkin' world because of the business he's in.  Either way, he's like a man in a desert who forgot to bring water.  Unusual buddy film, but, it works!  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>We have all scene countless movies about two people who should not be on the same planet let alone in the same room together who bond through some cinematic ordeal and become an unlikely pair of friends.  "The Matador" is one of those types of movies.  Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) is a professional hit man, whose euphemism of choice is that he is a "facilitator" of fatalities.  Then we have Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), a businessman who is in Mexico City desperately trying to salvage a business deal that has probably already gone south.  Julian is already there to do some of his facilitating when they meet in the hotel bar.  Over drinks Danny tells about the death of his infant son, and Julian responds by telling a dirty joke.<br /><br />It would be hard for a relationship to get off of more of a bad foot (I believe the record is held by Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, who woos the Lady Anne while she is praying over the coffin of her husband, who was killed by Richard, as detailed in the romantic comedy "Richard III").  But while Julian has no social skills beyond juvenile comebacks, dirty jokes, and outright lies, he has found in Danny somebody who is willing to actually listen to what he has to say.  That compels Julian to actually say something of substance and this new experience comes to a head at the local bullring where Danny asks what Julian does for a living and he decides to not only tell his new friend the truth, but also shows him how to play the game.<br /><br />Things come to a head between Danny and Julian several times, and with Julian banging on Danny's hotel door trying to (again) apologize, we jump six months down the road.  This time when Julian starts knocking on Danny's door it is back at his home in Denver where he lives with his wife Carolyn (Hope Davis), who is called "Bean."  Julian has been suffering from panic attacks and has lost the war.  This is not the sort of thing his employer, Mr. Randy (Philip Baker Hall), is willing to tolerate and Julian tells Danny that he has one last chance to do a job and do it right, or else it is more than his professional career that is going to be terminated.  Danny, somewhat to our surprise, not only agrees, but is insistent on helping Julian.<br /><br />What the hell happened in that six month gap created when Richard Shepard's film jumped forward?  That is a good question, and the good news is that this film has a great answer to that good question.  One of the things that I want from a film like this is a rationale explanation for why two people who are opposites should decide that they compliment each other rather than rub each other the wrong way and end up being friends.  "The Matador" has that and it is what makes the film work, along with a memorable performance by Brosnan.  I would not exactly say he is exorcising James Bond in this movie, but there are definitely several in jokes that play off of that in the film.  Kinnear gets to play it straight while Brosnan lets out all the stops with his character.  Julian might be falling apart, but it is when he picks his moments to strip away the veneer, that make watching this film and its familiar "odd couple" plot line worth while.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Richard Shepard's "The Matador" has a great core cast of Pierce Brosnan, Hope Davis, and Greg Kinnear.  These three actors eat up the lions' share of screen time in this tight, surprisingly endearing black comedy, with Philip Baker Hall making some fun brief appearances.  But make no mistake, this is Pierce Brosnan's movie.  And he makes elevates it to fun, surprising heights.<br /><br />Brosnan has played against type before (by "type," I mean the super-suave Hero role of James Bond and "The Thomas Crown Affair" - Brosnan's "type" is how Austin Powers sees himself) in "The Tailor of Panama."  And it worked famously.  But his failed, desperate spy in "Tailor" was only a shade off from his usual role.  In "Matador," Brosnan grows a hilarious mustache, adds a few pounds and some stubble, and broadens his accent to hilarious lengths.  His Julian Noble is not James Bond on a bad hair day - he's the kind of guy who doesn't get admitted to the casinos where Bond plays baccarat.<br /><br />Struggling with the prospect of "losing his nerve," Noble drunkenly lurches toward a lifeline of friendship tossed to him by Kinnear, who plays Danny Wright.  Wright is in Mexico City attempting to put together a business deal that will save himself from financial ruin.  Wright is also struggling with the weight of the death of his son almost four years ago in a school bus accident.  Kinnear plays Wright as a hilariously normal guy who can't believe (at first) that he's met up with an actual hit man in Noble.  It's fun to watch these actors stumble toward friendship, but they are reminders that both of these guys can flat-out act.  Noble needs Wright because Wright is a nice "regular" guy, and Wright latches on to Noble because Noble is an exciting tonic in Wright's rather depressing life.  (Depressing, that is, with the exception of his marriage to "Bean," played by Hope Davis.  This is one of the better on-screen marriages in a while.)<br /><br />"Matador" adopts a non-linear plot, which is essential to masking a key plot point from Mexico until the very end.  I did not see this revelation coming, but it justifies the dramatic lengths Wright ultimately goes to in order to save Noble from a frustrated former employer.  To say that this plot point was surprising in an otherwise ebon-black comedy is an understatement.<br /><br />"Matador" is by no means a "classic" film, but it is a solid, intelligent, quirky, uplifting story of love and friendship revolving around three real characters.  Once it's censored, it's sure to have a long run on basic cable.  But get yourself the uncensored DVD so you can romp in the fleshy, profane world of Julian Noble.  He'll make you smile.  A lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Julian Noble - the amoral, drunken and sleazy hit man in writer/director Richard Shepard's dark comedy The Matador - is a character that Pierce Brosnan was undoubtedly born to play. Never before have I seen an actor fit a role so perfectly here. He absolutely shines in one of the most darkly sexy performances to come along in recent years.<br /><br />As the hedonistic Mr. Noble, Brosnan travels the world eliminating people for unseen corporate interests, whiling away the hours between jobs by fornicating with whores, underage girls - and probably a few men - whilst also gulping down huge quantities of liquor and occasionally puffing on a cigar or two.<br /><br />While on a job in Mexico City he meets the naive businessman Danny Knight (Greg Kinnear) who has been fighting a loosing streak - he's still reeling from the loss of his son and now he's about to lose a lucrative business contract to a Mexican competitor. To add insult to injury, his house was partly destroyed by a falling tree just as he and his loving wife Bean (Hope Davis) were about to spend some passionate time together.<br /><br />It's Julian's birthday so he wants to celebrate and suddenly lonely spies Danny in a hotel bar. After Julian shocks Danny with an irreverent comment about Mexico, margaritas and a certain male appendage - one of the best lines in the film - the couple strikes up an uneasy friendship.<br /><br />Danny's deal grows problematical, forcing him to stay on a few days, so Julian takes Danny under his wing and takes him on a trip to a bullfight and into his confidence where he talks about the nobility of death and reveals that his occupation is a "facilitator of fatalities." Of course, it's is only a matter of time before he requests Danny's help as a co-facilitator. The problem, however, is that Julian is having a midlife crisis.<br /><br />Not only is Julian questioning his chosen profession, he's also just screwed up an important assignment because he's having problems pulling the trigger. The big guys are after him, and he's now become used goods. Frightened for his life, he turns to Danny - and by association Bean - who have become his only friends and ironically his salvation.<br /><br />Matador gets most of its comic mileage out of the ferociously irreverent script and the strange and unlikely friendship, the type of witty byplay that develops between Julian and Danny. Pretty early on it's established that both are diametric opposites, but in reality are they that different from each other? Julian is the cool, suave and confident sleaze and Danny is the Boy Scout who always plays by the rules - the hook is that there's a part of him that is fascinated with Julian's lifestyle.<br /><br />All three of the major players - Davis, Kinnear and Brosnan are absolutely terrific. Brosnan, who's looks physically better the older he gets, stages a full-scale assault on his image. He not only walks across a hotel lobby wearing nothing but a Speedo and cowboy boots, he shows that he can play crude and mean it. It's a skillful real tour de force comic feat and a real pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The movie also makes the most out of some exotic locales - Manila, Budapest and Vienna, and of course Mexico City, which adds to the riddle and sense of mystery that contributes to Julian's transient existence. Richard Shepard obviously has a flair for dark comedy and the irreverent side of life, and he really persuades us to gradually bond with these strangely enigmatic characters, which by the film's end have become the unlikeliest of soul mates. Mike Leonard July 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>After watching "The Matador," I couldn't help but feel that Pierce Brosnan must feel some relief. No doubt he enjoyed his days - and paychecks, as James Bond.  But as an actor he must of felt at times as if he were encased in amber.  What the "Matador" illustrates, without doubt, is that Brosnan has some serious acting chops.  With his world weary wrinkles, salt and pepper hair, Brosnan is no longer the super precise and super neat Remington Steele. What you have instead, due to all this natural seasoning, is a very convincing - in a black comedy way--performance as the burned out assassin Julian Noble.  (One has to think the Coen brothers might soon be giving Brosnan a call.)  Perverse, a bit kooky, drunk, lonely, and funny as hell, Noble is all of the above, but he will kill you - for a price.<br /><br />But where "The Matador" succeeds as a showcase for one actor's fine performance, it somewhat limps along as far as a story goes. The first half, which takes place in Mexico, is superb.  The weakest part of the story is the Greg Kinnear/Hope Davis portion of the movie, which comes to dominate the last half of the film.  The script goes to great lengths to establish a foundation for what is to come in the second half of the movie between Kinnear (as businessman Danny Wright (get it?), and Noble.  But for some reason this never really takes off.  If anything, Kinnear's sporting of a newly grown mustache (in imitation of his assassin friend?) has me recalling a wide-eyed Michael J. Fox.  And Hope Davis going potty mouthed upon meeting Noble, didn't seem to serve much purpose.  Maybe this is just a case of an overwhelming performance swamping the intended script.  But the script does demand a level of balance between Wright and Noble, but what the movie shows is that Brosnan is truly the lone wolf in this bunch.  Everything else seems simply tacked on</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>While in Mexico City, Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan), a womanizing hit man, lands right in the middle of a big, fat mid-life crisis. There for a job, he realizes he has no one to share his birthday with and this causes the downward spiral to hit him full force. Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), a businessman experiencing a couple of tough years, has just made a pitch to a company headquartered in Mexico City. Positive the pitch went well, he walks into the hotel bar to celebrate and orders a margarita. Julian is already drinking his fourth or fifth and they start a strange, awkward conversation which leads to an equally strange and awkward relationship.<br /><br />"The Matador", written and directed by Richard Shephard, provides a juicy, meaty role for Pierce Brosnan, allowing him to portray a character who is the antithesis of James Bond. But the film has problems and Brosnan can't smooth them over enough to make the film work.<br /><br />Brosnan is amusing and engaging as Julian, his most interesting role in years, maybe ever. Julian's lifestyle is beginning to take its toll; too much booze, too many women, and the requirements of his job have seriously warped his world view. For a while, he seems to enjoy the life. Who wouldn't enjoy a life with no restrictions? But then he begins to realize his existence lacks the key elements people need to survive. Most notably, companionship, love and friendship.<br /><br />Naturally, this realization hits on his birthday, when he is sitting alone in his hotel room, with no one to talk to or share the day with. This scene is very funny and a little sad. Brosnan manages to convey the character's many facets, helping to make Julian both interesting and unusual.<br /><br />Strangely, even though the character is not very likable, we feel empathy for him. The guy hits on a teenaged Catholic school girl in Mexico for goodness sakes, yet we still like him. As we realize Julian's life is, basically, out of control, we also understand he is used to living this life. He is used to sleeping with a different woman in every city. He is used to getting drunk and behaving outrageously. Because we watch a little of this, we understand how empty this ultimately is and when the midlife crisis hits, we believe it.<br /><br />Julian is also not afraid to say what he is thinking. Because he has no meaningful relationships, he is fairly crass and doesn't mind speaking openly about sex using vulgar terms. Some of these lines are really funny, more so because they are rarely uttered.<br /><br />Because Brosnan's character is so interesting, Kinnear's character seems particularly flat. They don't occupy the same universe. Clearly, they aren't coming from the same place in their lives, and that's the point, but I just didn't believe that Julian would find anything about Danny interesting. From the moment they first meet, Danny is clearly interested in everything Julian has to say, and vice verse, but the salesman is more than a little overwhelmed by the hit man. Danny is a normal guy, living a normal life, with his normal wife, Bean (Hope Davis). It seems natural that he would be a bit incredulous if someone he just met told him he was a hit man. I would react in the same way. But I think the key here is that there is no hint at any sort of character trait that would lead us to believe that Kinnear's Danny would feel comfortable enough to hang out with this guy. Yes, their initial relationship has some ups and downs, good times and bad, but a salesman from Denver is going to hang out with a guy who says he is a hit man? I don't believe it. There is nothing in Danny to indicate that he is just a little off, maybe just a little susceptible to Julian's charms. Without this, it seems too far a stretch for Danny to become so enamored of Julian. Yes, I get that Julian is very different, exciting, and that is a large part of the attraction, but Kinnear's character needs that something extra, that extra push towards the dark side.<br /><br />When the film picks up six months later, at Danny's home in Denver, it is amusing to see that Danny has grown a moustache, his act of rebellion and idol worship; Julian also has a moustache. But then Danny gets involved in Julian's life again, and it is, once again, a big stretch.<br /><br />Hope Davis' Bean is also interesting and slightly unusual. Very quiet, when she initially meets Julian, she becomes fascinated with him. There is a hint that she doesn't entirely believe that he is a hit man, but is willing to go along with his tall tales because it will add a little excitement to her life.<br /><br />The dynamic between the three characters is certainly better than 80% of the films we ever see, but it is missing one element, Danny's one character trait, to make the entire thing believable. Without it, their relationships don't work. And because the film is all about their relationships, this is problematic.<br /><br />Director Shephard has crafted an interesting visual look. As the film hops around the globe, each new location is designated with a huge title, filling the screen. Each of the locations they visit has a slightly dated look; the hotel in Mexico City is so chic it looks purposely dated, Danny and Bean's home is old-fashioned and even has a large console record player. All of this helps give the film the feel of "Caper" filcks from the late 60s and early 70s.<br /><br />In an interview on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart", Brosnan talked about how Shephard initially came to his attention. Brosnan was interested in making "The Thomas Crown Affair 2" and received "The Matador" as a writing sample. They liked it so much, they decided to make it. "The Thomas Crown Affair", starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, was a remake of the 1968 film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. While the remake was made in 1999, it still had some elements from the original, some of the tone and feel, allowing the new version to retain some of the charm of the original. This is my long winded way of saying that it seems natural that Shepherd would use his screenplay for "The Matador" as a sample for a planned sequel to "The Thomas Crown Affair".<br /><br />"The Matador" gets its title from a bullfight Julian and Danny attend. During the fight, Julian explains the bullfighter's methods and this becomes a loose metaphor for Julian's relationship with Danny and a metaphor for Julian's own life. It is very loose, almost non-existent, but it is there. The film would've benefited greatly from a stronger tie to this message. In Woody Allen's "Match Point", the director begins the film with voice over from Rhys-Meyers character explaining a Tennis play which later figures prominently in the resolution. The connection isn't beaten over our head, but it is there. In "The Matador", the connection is never remotely pointed out for the audience and I feel it may be too vague for many to pick up.<br /><br />Also, the film is about the characters, it isn't about Julian fulfilling his professional contracts. In fact, these are presented in a vague way. In almost every case, the contracts are fulfilled, yet we almost never see the completion of the contract. People are viewed in cross hairs, shots are fired, and just as we are about to see the end results, the film cuts away. Or we might watch Julian setting up a contract only to leave before we see him fulfill it. This is an interesting choice, reinforcing the director's main focus. Julian is a hit man, but the film is about his troubles dealing with that and his life.<br /><br />"The Matador" is, like the main character, strange, unusual and difficult to get along with. There will be moments you will enjoy and many more that you won't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan plays a thoroughly-enjoyable character (a gone-to-seed hitman with no ability to relate to people whatsoever whose analogies all reference prostitutes) the likes of whom I've never seen before in a film--the fact that the filmmakers surround him with an interesting cast and situations is just gravy.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>THE MATADOR is a nicely twisted take on mid-life crisis movies, but it's also a showcase for Pierce Brosnan ( still my favorite 'Bond' ). He plays a hitman that wouldn't know a scruple if he stepped on it, but in his own smarmy-creepy way remains a bit likeable despite his many faults. One day he wakes up in donkey-doo ( literally ), after failing to 'hit' the person he was assigned to kill. He meets a businessman whose own comfortable little life is unraveling. They become uncomfortable 'friends' over drinks, and the story begins to take some, strange, often darkly funny, and somewhat appalling turns. Greg Kinnear is humorous, and convincing in his role as Brosnan's very stiff, new buddy, But Brosnan is sensational. It's well worth a look- or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Richard Shepard's The Matador presents a new take on the assassin film. No longer the stuff of the Steven Segal movie of the week, Shepard presents his gunman as a man on the verge of total collapse looking for a friend and loooking for a way out of his profession.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan gives a career defining performance as Julien Noble, a burned out hitman, on his way to collapse. After four James Bond films this is the ultimate anti-Bond film. The character is disheveled, unsure of himself and definately not the ladies man we are used to seeing Brosnan play. The other side of the pair is Greg Kinnear as Danny Wright a mid level businessman on the verge of losing his job and possibly his wife played by Hope Davis.<br /><br />Far from the normal buddy film, Shepard allows his characters to develope slowly so that the audience truly understands their plight.

David Tattersall, who shot the last Star Wars film does a great job  making the film look like a much more expensive affair than it actually was. Robert Pearson's production design effectively doubles the Mexico City shooting location for many cities keeping things interesting.<br /><br />The DVD comes packed with many extras including a making of featurette, two complete radio shows in which Shepard discusses the writing of the film and its reception at the Sundance Film Festival, two commentaries featuring Shepard and his stars and a trailer.<br /><br />Check out this small gem of independant filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Even assassins can have a crisis of conscience, and this smart black comedy of rifle shots and mercenary murder gives us the ten-step program. What makes The Matador interesting is that the movie isn't about rehabilitation, but friendship.<br /><br />Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) is an assassin, or as he prefers to put it, "I facilitate fatalities." Unfortunately for Noble, he's seen better days, physically and professionally. Anxiety attacks sometimes spoil his aim. Age and the appearance of being a ticking time bomb leave him with no friends, no home and only sex and booze as consolation. Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), on the other hand, even though he's lost his job, has a solid, mutually-loving relationship with his wife, the childhood sweetheart he calls Bean (Hope Davis). Danny is a decent, honorable good guy. The two are going to meet in Mexico City in a sleek hotel bar. Danny has just made a pitch for a desperately needed business contract. Julian, with a bullet from a high-powered rifle, has just splattered the head of a woman his handler, Mr. Randy (Philip Baker Hall), assigned him to take out. Noble is so inappropriately smart-mouth Danny nearly walks away, but he is so needy that he gets Danny to go with him to a bullfight. And there, Julian sort of surprises himself by telling Danny he's an assass...facilitator of fatalities. In a great and funny set piece, Julian shows him just how it can be done by picking someone at random who happens to have body guards. Then he asks Danny for help. Danny flees back home.<br /><br />Months later, Danny and Bean in their Denver home hear a knock on their door late at night. It's Julian. He's screwed up once too often. The guys who hire him are after him. He confesses Danny is his only friend. Bean is fascinated. Danny is wary...but Danny is a good guy. After a night of getting-to-know-you-better, the next morning Danny and Julian are off to Phoenix for Julian's last assignment. Will they stay friends? Who knows? But as Julian tells Danny, "Just consider me the best cocktail party story you ever met."<br /><br />The movie needs to be seen to appreciate the skillful, straight-faced approach to murder this comedy provides. There are no particular moral condemnations of Julian, just a kind of concerned response by Danny and Bean to his falling-apart neediness. The black comedy arises from the situation, but the fascination arises from the friendship that develops between these two men, the amoral Julian prone to anxiety attacks and the decent Danny. Pierce Brosnan gives one of the best performances of his career. If you weren't as decent as Danny, you'd never want Brosnan's Julian anywhere near you. He's no smooth James Bond here, just an inappropriately wisecracking assassin who appreciates sex in all its fine variety. Greg Kinnear has the tough job of balancing Danny's niceness with Brosnan's showy turn. He does it. It's Kinnear who makes The Matador such a weird and fine buddy movie.<br /><br />Brosnan, for me, usually in his hero roles comes across as smug. As Julian Noble, Brosnan let's his usual veneer of charm and competence develop cracks. Brosnan knows what he's doing. I think he was just about as excellent in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDVT">Evelyn</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXWG">The Tailor of Panama</a>. To see him in sympathetic lead hero mode before the heroic smugness set in, watch him in the TV movie Murder 101. Although Philip Baker Hall has a small role that could have been played by any competent actor, he makes a nice impression because we've liked him so much in other movies. To see just how extraordinary he was as an actor, check out his tour de force performance as Richard Nixon in Robert Altman's one-actor movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNG8">Secret Honor - Criterion Collection</a>. Hall looks nothing like Nixon, but there is absolutely no doubt who the character is, deep in the scotch and the self-pity, that we're watching. One word of warning for the family trade: The Matador has some of the funniest, most vivid and most obscene lines of dialogue I've heard in a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>After MGM dumped him from the stagnant Bond franchise and implicitly questioned his abilities as an actor, Brosnan signed on to The Matador and turned in the performance of his career.<br /><br />Brosnan plays Julian Noble, an unkempt, oft-inebriated, and decidedly unsuave world-class assassin who suffers from panic attacks. In other words - he's the anti-bond. Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis play the ordinary couple who are sucked into Julian's world in this odd mash-up of spy-thriller and buddy comedy, but Brosnan undoubtedly steals the show.<br /><br />His Julian is a vulgar, shiftless villain with an appetite for orgies, underage girls, and conspicuously well-shaken vodka martinis. He is disgusting, pathetic and uninhibited by conscience, a combination that makes his nervous instability all the more unsettling. The fact that Brosnan still manages to make us root for Julian is quite a feat. Critics be silenced - this man can act.<br /><br />The story itself is well executed, if somewhat predictable, but Brosnan easily carries it over the finish on Julian's shoulders. A better than average film featuring a must-see performance by Brosnan.  DVD includes directors commentary and behind the scenes footage.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Pierce Brosnan is the burned out hit man who meets Greg Kinnear as a straight lace yet down on his luck salesman. They meet at a bar in Mexico where the real adventure begins with the strangest friendship that is somewhat believable considering where they both were in their lives. It is sort of black comedy about doing the right thing. And there is an interesting twist in the movie. They both do a superb job of acting that is what drives this movie. This character driven movie does have some strong sexual content.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I had moderate expectations for "The Matador." I had heard some good reviews, especially for Pierce Brosnan for sending up his James Bond persona. Expecting a full-out comedy of a has-been hitman, I instead got a thoughtful, and funny, character study. Utilizing aspects of buddy comedy, slapstick, and thrillers--"The Matador" weaves together a story of two men, essentially, at crossroads in their lives. They come together out a certain necessity and form a strange bond that neither knew they needed. I really enjoyed this story, it's one of the bigger surprises I've had in a while. This film has a heart and subtlety that I hadn't expected, but certainly welcomed.<br /><br />The story really gets going in Mexico. Kinnear is trying to land a big account, and Brosnan is also there on "business." Brosnan's in a bit of a slump, having botched a previous job and realizing he's alone for his birthday. None of his usual diversions (drinking and sex) are helping, so he befriends Kinnear at the hotel bar. The two form a tentative relationship which escalates when Brosnan reveals his occupation. At first, Kinnear is skeptical, then fascinated, and then somewhat disturbed. The two share some escapades around town and when Brosnan asks for Kinnear's help on a "job," the two have a falling out. Some months later, Brosnan shows up at Kinnear's home. There is some unfinished business between the two, and I won't reveal more than that.<br /><br />The pleasure in "The Matador" comes primarily from the character development. I think that many people approached this film expecting a ribald comedy (and there are very strong comedic aspects), but the film works largely as a study of friendship and male bonding. Watching the evolution of the relationship between Kinnear and Brosnan is the film's strong point. These two are put in the most outlandish situations, and yet, the performances ground the characters in a subtle reality. It's as if the "wacky" plot development is secondary to a refreshingly believable interaction between two disparate personalities. It's really quite rare, and most unexpectedly pleasurable.<br /><br />Much has been made of Brosnan's performance. Earning him critical accolades, he is a bit of a burnt-out Bond--an emotional and lonely mess. But I also want to mention Kinnear. This ranks with his top work (which must be "Auto Focus"), and the film would not have succeeded without his adept portrayal. Add indie favorite Hope Davis as Kinnear's wife, and you couldn't ask for a better performed film. I had hoped to like "The Matador," but I also respect it. In other hands, I feel this film could have gone terribly wrong. As is, though, it's a real genre-busting treat. KGHarris, 01/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This was certainly an unusual little movie that I missed in the theaters.  It involves a chance meeting between a down on his luck salesman(Kinnear) and a burned out assassin(Brosnan) and the unusual friendship they develop.  I think Pierce steals the movie with his assassin with issues character.  Kinnear is very good as well in his role.  I really enjoy him in this offbeat roles.  Little Miss Sunshine is another good movie with him.  This was a fun and interesting movie.  It is about the characters developing and wanting just to achieve what they each perceive as success.  Though it is a drama, it is sprinkled with enough humor to keep it from getting too dark.  Worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"The Matador" is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow, happily-married American businessman (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico.  Although the sardonic Julian (ironically surnamed "Noble") appears to be a "tough guy" on the surface, underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities, a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless. Thus on his birthday, he reaches out to Danny, a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by Julian's "unconventional" lifestyle.  In fact, both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter, franker moments of self-evaluation.<br /><br />Although the film is a bit too reminiscent of "Analyze This" and "Midnight Run" to feel entirely fresh and original, "The Matador," nevertheless, earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting.  Brosnan, looking aged and almost used up, sinks his teeth into the role of Julian in a way he never has before.  Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being, Brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment, then genuine and sympathetic the next.  He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale.  Kinnear is also excellent as the Regular Joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the Dark Side as his relationship with Julian deepens.  Hope Davis does a fine job as "Bean," Danny's loyal and loving wife who, like her husband, finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and "dangerous" figure from a world far different from the one she knows.<br /><br />At times, we find ourselves feeling that "The Matador" is holding something back from us, not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise.  At the end it feels a little too light, a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should.  This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director Richard Shephard, and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet.  Still, one appreciates the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece, rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh.<br /><br />`The Matador" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will, hopefully, signal a new phase in Brosnan's acting career.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Consider this exchange between two very disparate strangers that become good friends and drinking buddies in a foreign land:<br /><br />International Businessman: "I want you to kill my chief competitor."<br />International Assassin: "I won't do it. The guilt would corrode you for the rest of your life."<br /><br />Then, several months later:<br /><br />International Assassin (to International Businessman): "You owe me a favor. I want you to help me kill someone."<br /><br />Mind you, the favor for which International Businessman is indebted is the refusal by International Assassin to do something that will cause the former lifelong guilt. Given that, the favor the latter now asks for would seem a total disconnect considering the depth of their friendship.<br /><br />In THE MATADOR, Pierce Brosnan plays international killer-for-hire Julian Noble. While on a job in Mexico City, he meets international businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in a hotel watering hole. The two become buds after some initial awkwardness. They bond at a bullfight, during which Julian, lulled by Danny's "Mr. (w)Right", all-American goodness and naivet&eacute;, reveals to his new chum his line of work. Danny is incredulous at first, a feeling that transitions to shocked belief as Julian demonstrates how to set up a hit on a man in the spectator crowd that Wright randomly picks. In the succeeding six months, Noble, apparently suffering a nervous breakdown, fails at a couple of assignments and falls into his employer's extreme disfavor. One night, a needy Julian shows up on the doorstep of the comfortable suburban home Danny shares with his wife Bean (Hope Davis).<br /><br />The main attraction of this film is watching Brosnan, perhaps unrecognizable at first, play the role of the hard drinking, compulsively wenching killer. With his brush-cut hair, moustache, and pronounced beard stubble, Julian looks more like Saddam Hussein in the dock, or perhaps 007 gone to seed after being given the sack by the SIS. But he still manages to exude a crooked-smile charm that attracts Danny and the audience. The downside, for me, was that I really didn't get the plot's point. My wife said the message was that Julian was really a "noble", decent soul that cracked under the stress of his job. Well, OK. This after 12 years in the business. It wasn't convincing, or, even if it was, the premise doesn't seem worth a feature length film.<br /><br />As much fun as Brosnan fans might find in THE MATADOR, wait for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This movie is aptly named.  The best thing in it is the actual bullfight where the individual matadors are shown as icons.  Not the killers they are, but as the victor over the big bad bull, with their forceful 'quick kill.'<br /><br />Julian is a master of the quick kill, but his are done the cowardly way, from afar with explosives or high-powered guns like Oswald's, though he struts around like a peacock dressed as James Earl Ray, real assassins.  "You are what you do" is the prevailing theme through this globetrotting adventure of the dark side of life.  He calls himself a "faciliator of fatalities," remarkable for someone so dumb.<br /><br />When the two main characters meet in Mexico City, in a bar no less, the nasty person tells the gullible American to "think positive."  Then, he parlays him into going to a bull fight for which he already has tickets.  "You've never seen Mexico City until you've seen a bull fight with a matador form Spain, ole!"<br /><br />He's an assassin with no friends and no place to call home, how incredible.  With Danny, Julian becomes a leech and tells lies which catch up with him six months later.  The mythical scene of Danny asking Julian to kill his competitor so that his company in Denver will get the contract didn't happen -- Danny did not open the door and let the corrupt hitman into the hotel room, nor did he say goodbye.<br /><br />When things start getting worse for the assassin, and he's lost his nerve to fulfill some assignments, he runs to Denver at Christmas time, as he has no place else to go -- no family, friends, or home.  Danny asks, "Why don't I believe you?" about needing his help to 'off' someone at the horsetrack in Tucson.  "I tell the truth when I can," and "truth is unacceptable" in his field of work ("My business is my pleasure."), he sets up an elaborate scheme to kill an innocent bystander to prove to Danny that he is not as strange as he may seem; they are opposites, which makes the movie bearable to watch.  When that goes awry, he admits that "it won't last, that's a given," but he had nowhere else to go and no one in the world to talk with on intimate terms.  The song at the end, "Just Hold On," left you feeling deceived.  It was a strange premise for a movie (I went only because I had a pen pal in Spain many years  ago and wanted to see what a real 'matador' looks like.  There were at least three, all wearing pink stockings, and they did look fantastic.), but the acting was marvelous.  Now, we know who can take over Anthony Hopkins' weird roles, Pierce Bronsan.  He showed his other side in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>I could not believe that Pierce Brosnan could be funny!  He wasn't even this funny in *Remington Steele*.  Greg Kinnear was a compatible actor with Brosnan.<br /><br />Brosnan plays Julian Noble, who is an assassin or rather a "facilitator of fatilities".  He travels around the world to eliminate his targets.  When he gets to Mexico City, he meets Danny Wright (Kinnear) at a hotel bar over margaritas.  Danny is an unlucky businessman who is trying to get back on the rise.<br /><br />This particular introduction is the best part.  They're trying to have conversation yet they keep misunderstanding each other, even to the point of being completely rude.  Yet they stay around to continue chatting.  Finally, to smooth things over, Julian invites Danny to a bullfight event.  There, Julian reveals what he does.  Of course, thinking Julian is joking, Danny doesn't believe him.  At this point, things are even funnier especially when Julian asks Danny to help him out on a target in Mexico City.<br /><br />The weekend quickly comes to an end.  Julian continues to travel around the world to do his job.  However, Julian makes a mistake and then another.  On the run, Julian shows up at Danny's residence in Denver...6 months later.  Once again, Julian asks Danny for his help.  Of course, they go through this whole drama that was played out earlier.<br /><br />There are a few things why I loved this movie.  Brosnan plays Julian well, nothing similar to Steele or James Bond.  Julian is mysterious.  He bops women but then there are hints where he just might be bisexual.  There's one particular scene that keeps coming up but isn't really shown completely.  You can't help but wonder what happened.  Julian is wacky as he'll walking around a hotel in speedos and cowboy boots.  Kinnear is equally funny as this naive man trying to survive in this cruel world.  He's a trusting man who cannot decipher truth from fiction.  And Julian wants this man help him out on a "job"?!?!<br /><br />So, check out *The Matador* and enjoy a few chuckles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan), a 22-year veteran hitman, is everything James Bond is not. His muscles lax; he had no friends, let alone adoring female companions; and more importantly he didn't love his job. In this regard, Pierce Brosnan successfully portrayed the tough, burnt out, lone assassin who had serious reflections on his career dilemma in Mexico.<br /><br />In came another troubled man, Danny (Greg Kinnear), a traveling salesman whose career revival hung on the success of a deal. Thus began the improbable relationship of two lone men, whose characters and professions could not be more further apart. What happened at the backstage of a spectacular bull fight was no less exciting than what took place in the arena. Yet good times did not last long and the scene stopped with Julian at the hotel pounding Danny's door for reconciliation. The catch was we did not know what immediately happened after that!<br /><br />Months later, Julian popped in Danny's home in Denver and asked Danny to do something incredible to secure his retirement. Was it blackmail from an assassin or a favour expected of a good friend ? One's left guessing. All I can say was that when I thought I knew what happened, the story went the other way with an intriguing twist.<br /><br />While Pierce Brosnan succeeded in shaking off any remaining trace of 007, Greg Kinnear impressed with his sincerity and naturalness as a decent man. It explained why he had a devoted loving wife (Hope Davis) despite the unfavourable circumstances. He added a fine human touch and comical sense ( a subtler Jack Lemmon) to his character.<br /><br />The lines were well written. In just a few lines, we understood how deeply Danny and Bean loved each other. We also knew Danny was as much a friend in need to Julian as Julian did Danny. The jigsaw pieces fell nicely to their places, but not until the last minute. Despite some foul language, this is a fine and subtle movie emphasizing love, lasting relationship and support.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"The Matador" stars Pierce Brosnan ('Die Another Day'), Oscar nominee Greg Kinnear (Best Supporting Actor, 'As Good As It Gets'), and Hope Davis ('The Weather Man') and is exactly what the critics have said about it. Brosnan gives his best performance, the movie is really entertaining, and it's one of the best films of last year. Brosnan plays Julian Noble, a lonely hit man who does what hit men do. They travel wherever they need to go, kill the person they need to kill, and then fornicate with some women. Julian, however, is in a rut over this. Meanwhile, Danny Wright (Kinnear) is a lawyer who is down on his luck. There's a heartwrenching event in his past, he's out of a job, and a tree has just fallen through his house. Danny heads to Mexico in the hopes of getting a job, when he meets Julian in a mexican bar. The two don't immediately click, but the next day Julian apologizes and offers Danny to a bullfight. At the bullfight, the subject of Julian's work comes up...Flash forward 6 months later. Danny's luck is back; He got the job and he's enjoying life with his wife Bean (Davis), that's when Julian shows up and tells Danny that he needs help with a job; Otherwise, he'll be killed. Now, some of this story, has become cliche lately. "The Whole Nine Yards" deal with a sensitive hitman and there's other movies that deal with this subject; But Brosnan so fully immerses himself in the role, it's hard to resist. The way he takes charge of the performance kind of reminds me of Ben Kingsley in "Sexy Beast." Greg Kinnear is perfectly cast as the nervous good guy, who's intrigued enough by Julian to help him out. Also helping the movie along is the score by Rolfe Kent (who scores Alexander Payne's films; About Schmidt, Election, Sideways). The movie's script is witty, the action is exciting. This is just a really good movie, period.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>***Spoiler Warning***<br /><br />'Matador' is notable because it's one of Pierce Brosnan's first films after completing his stint for Queen & Country - and I loved it. Why? Not necessarily because the film was good - it was very decent. But because in choosing to do this project, he went 'full circle', doing the same thing when he first *lost* the role of Secret Agent 007 back in 1986.<br /><br />During that tumultuous period in the mid-1980s, Brosnan was tied to a television contract. Despite the fact that he had lobbied hard and was the Broccolis' first choice to play Bond, legal issues brought by the production company and NBC eventually led to them to choose another performer over him. To say he was angry would be monumentally understated. He was pissed. And he made no attempt to quietly accept the decision.<br /><br />He was so frustrated with MTM and the producers of the hit tv show that he eventually executed two overt actions to make his position clear.<br /><br />First, he signed with Coca-Cola to do a special project: A nationally broadcasted commercial. In it, he played an unnamed sharply-dressed secret agent-type who deftly dispatches a bunch of ninjas via spectacular, yet casual, maneuvered expertise - ending with him seated next to a beautiful babe. Basically: A sharpened stick publicly poked into the collective eye of everyone who prevented him from getting the role he so desperately wanted.<br /><br />Seeing is believing. So if you doubt the history as I described it - search the terms "Brosnan + Diet Coke" on YouTube. You can see for yourself the 1987 commercial spot, which I personally find hilarious given the context of its creation. :-D<br /><br />Then secondly, immediately after completing his tv contract, he took on his very first film project post 'Remington Steele'. And what was that? Playing a handsome cold-blooded secret agent in '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C88LH">The Fourth Protocol</a>'. (an all-time favorite) Which was released almost exactly at the same time as the first new Bond movie, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W9CB">The Living Daylights</a>', the very film that would've been his had it not been snatched from his grasp. I have nothing ill to say about Timothy Dalton, whom I found very serviceable in the role. But oh, what fun we would of had Brosnan gotten those two earlier films.<br /><br />Anyway, Pierce made his point. It would be another ten long years, but he would again be up for the role of The Man With A License To Kill. There wasn't dispute or delay that time. And over the next seven years, he executed a fantastic rendition of 007 across four films in the franchise.<br /><br />And now comes this movie - 'Matador' - which translates to 'The Killer' in Spanish. One of his first projects immediately after his resignation from Double O status. In the film, it tells the story about a cold-blooded assassin who finds himself burnt out with the business of contract killing, pointlessly fornicating women, and drinking to drown away his lonliness. He wants to retire.<br /><br />Loved it! Full circle. The man is Zen personified.<br /><br />I enjoyed this much more than I would've expected, not only because I kept snickering at Brosnan's cleverness. But because I kept anticipating the ubiquitous must-have modern twist. Having identified with the regular guy played by Greg Kinnear, the last thing I wanted was to see myself getting screwed over. So the tension built, not unlike waiting for your arm to get punched by a buddy. That's what made this so exciting. Why? Because there wasn't a twist. The story played perfectly straight - so my appreciation for his character of the professional assassin, Julian Noble, exploded into deep relief and respectful admiration.<br /><br />After so many seemingly mandatory bleep-you endings, my thinking was there just *has* to be some kind of weird and terribly messy final&eacute;. I was shocked that this played out completely straight. Pleasantly so.<br /><br />An old school Action/Comedy = Excellence.<br /><br />Definitely enjoyable as a one-time rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>This was a fairly enjoyable movie.

An interesting tale of an assassin, or "facilitator", whose starting to discover that he no longer has the knack for doing what he does and forms an unlikely friendship with a man (Greg Kinnear) who helps him get out of his line of work...before his line of work puts him out.  The movie overall, spare some crude language that I wasn't real keen on, was a good watch.  I'd recommend at least renting it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>Excellent script, excellent acting.<br /><br />And good little plot twist at the end.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I see that it's tough for actors who play cultural icons to get work once they end that phase of their careers. George Reeves committed suicide after failing to find work after his 50's portrayal of Superman on TV. Adam West never got a good role after the campy '60's "Batman." Even Sean Connery had a period of obscurity after his James Bond period. This brings us to Pierce Brosnan, another James Bond: movie-star handsome, perfect in the role of the urbane, suave, and emotionally distant Agent 007. Brosnan tried to move beyond this typecasting with "The Tailor of Panama," but didn't quite succeed. Going to a more extreme character in "The Matador," Brosnan proves he might have a career ahead of him. He's going to need more plausible scripts, though, because none of the key plot points in "The Matador" are credible.<br /><br />I still don't know why they call it a thriller when there wasn't any tension or suspense in here. You kind of knew what was coming except, perhaps, in several instances and there wasn't much tension or suspense in those instances. One of the good aspects of this film was the decision for Brosnan to roughen up his looks. His scraggly beard, bad hair, yellowed teeth, and the wild edge in his smile make him a credible, burnt-out, hit man. Additionally, he takes to his role with gusto. His fear as he begins to have nervous breakdowns, his desperate attempts to booze and whore his way back to sanity, and his life-saving grab to make a friend out of mild-mannered, middle-class Danny, are believably pathetic. I felt twinges of sympathy for this killer going over the edge. Their initial and unlikely acquaintance is believable only because it's in Mexico. The relationship between these two males is under constantly episodic humorous tension throughout the movie which is a plus in this film. Hope Davis also turns in a fine minor performance as Kinnear's character's wife.<br /><br />The script was pretty good, the bright colors and bold cinematography and banners are reminiscent, in a good way, of Quentin Tarantino at his best. To some extent, the scenic and cinematographic movement is what gives the movie a strong sense of action as much as character movement. The plot almost feels as if it has a life independent of the characters; as if the characters are acting out a minor sequence in a bigger sweep of `Story,' which almost seems like a `Character' in itself. Sound weird? Well, I guess it is, in a way. But it sure seems to work for me. Still, it's a good buddy-flick that's worth your time but try to leave Bond out of your mind before you watch this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) plays an oversexed assassin with no friends, until he meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), a salesman who is down on his luck in Mexico.

The two disparate men meet in a bar, share drinks, and after some of the cleverest tete a tete on film form a bond that neither of them expects.  Brosnan's hitman character and Kinnear's slipping business failure at first collide and then mutually benefit from embracing what seem to be polar opposites of characters.  How the whole chance meeting alters their lives is hilarious, edgy, and tender.<br /><br />Brosnan, Kinnear, and Davis display fine ensemble acting and keep the movie constantly flowing despite the strange twists and turns the story takes.  But a great deal of the credit goes to the razor sharp direction of Richard Shepard whose sense of comic and dramatic timing are superb.

Actually, "The Matador" is a really entertaining and hilarious film.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan, who seems to be favouring character roles now that he is getting too old to play heroes, plays Julian Noble, a burnt out hitman who happens to meet Greg Kinnear's struggling salesman while on a job in Mexico. As Noble, Brosnan is over the top and hilarious to watch. He's hyperactive, in your face and not in the least bit apologetic for it. Kinnear arguably has the harder role of the two, as his character is essentially just there to witness the actions of Noble, and yet he manages to make his character believable and more than just a spectator.<br /><br />The plot of this film is nothing new, you could argue that it is just "The Odd Couple" with sex and violence. Yet, it is well done, and although not the most memorable of films, watching it did provide me with a good evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>This is a great character comedy, with a dash of sex and violence. Pierce Brosnan is able to cut loose in this film, and creates a wonderfully bizarre character. He comes accross as a combination of conniving lecherous Beetlejuice from that picture, and a burnt out gone to seed third rate Bond. He manages to be repulsive and sympathetic at the same time. It is a great role, and he plays it to the hilt. The scenes shot in Mexico are vibrant and colorful. I would have liked a little more meat to the final job, possibly some more hurdles for the Greg Kinnear character to have to jump, helping Brosnan and cementing his new found confidence in himself. This is an enjoyable romp.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>The Matador is a slightly off-kilter, pleasantly surprising movie that gently leads the viewer on a tour of unpredictability. Richard Shepard wrote and directed this little gem of a film in his well-deserved departure from smaller independent films to a full-budgeted film. He makes great use of his new resources, recruiting cinematographer David Tattersall (Die Another Day, Star Wars I-III, The Green Mile). Tattersall makes every frame thrilling and adds even more to Brosnan and Kinnear's performances.<br /><br />Now that we're on the subject, Pierce Brosnan really shines as hitman Julian Noble, a character that seems to have been written for him to make a perfect transition, shedding his James Bond image without completely losing it. As Noble begins to fall apart, Brosnan gets to show that not only is he charming, and deboinair, he's also a brilliant actor with great control on a depth of emotions. His Golden Globe nomination was well deserved.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear gives an equally transfixing performance as Danny Wright, a down on his luck business man who meets Julian on a trip to Mexico, where the two share an unidentifiable bond. Kinnear has an almost unique ability in Hollywood to portray a general sense of optimism, while also relaying a clear sense of desperation to the audience. He shines in this film in a prelude to the down-on-his-luck character he plays in Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />Hope Davis doesn't have as big a role as either of the male leads, but she makes a strong showing and through her ability to translate the script into clear emotions she manages to stand out as more than just a "wife" character. The three main cast members really make this film work.<br /><br />In the end, surprisingly, The Matador is a slightly sentimental - without being cheesy - examination of friendship, love, devotion, and doing what's right. The audience will leave the film feeling satisfied, entertained, and a little bit better about life in general. Don't miss out on this one.<br /><br />The DVD includes several deleted scenes and a making of documentary that offers some insight into the director's take on the film. It's all interesting, but the film stands on its own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Pierce Brosnan (Mrs. Doubtfire, GoldenEye) plays hitman Julian Noble who has seriously lost his edge on killing people. While in Mexico City he meets Danny, played by Greg Kinnear (Auto Focus, Nurse Betty) and the two of them have a conversation that night. Kinnear asks Brosnan what he does and Brosnan tells him he's a hitman but Kinnear doesnt believe him, so Brosnan shows him some things and this convinces Kinnear that he is. Years later, Kinnear and his wife, played by Hope Davis (The Weatherman, American Splendor) get a surprising guest, Julian who shows up and tells Danny that someone has put out a hit on his life because Noble didnt kill who he was supposed to. Brosnan is fantastic in this and Kinnear is always good as usual. This gets Brosnan out of the pits that were Die Another Day and After The Sunset. It turns from comedy into serious towards the end when Brosnan has his mental breakdown and he cant pull the trigger but it still is a great movie. Some funny dialouge as well. Also starring Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights, Rush Hour), Dylan Baker (Changing Lanes, Thirteen Days) and Adam Scott (The Aviator, Hellraiser: Bloodline)</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>Pierce Brosnan does have an acting life outside of "James Bond".  Without his and Greg Kinnear's acting, the film would have died.  Pierce plays a lonely hit man kind of looking for a best friend.  He meets Kinnear in a bar in Mexico while both are there on business and they begin a friendship.  Pierce relates to Kinnear that he is a hit man.  The two then went their own separate ways. Pierce shows up on Kinnear's doorstep 6 years later, only to take him on an incredible journey of helping him make the most critical kill of his life.  Given the plot, I was looking for more of a thriller/suspense but I didn't get it.  It was moving at times, but it dragged on in many scenes.  It is worth watching as the two actors make the whole movie worthwhile, but don't look for the "James Bond" type of suspence and thrill, you won't get it...</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This movie is an uneasy, undecided hodgepodge of screen genres.<br /><br />It would sort of like to be an over-the-top male bonding comedy - like "The In-Laws." But it doesn't maintain a comedic tone consistently enough to achieve that. Too many really raw, realistic elements are interjected to allow a viewer to relate to the characters as benign buffoons. When Pierce Brosnan, in his role as hit-man, actually blows up a man and then blows off a woman's head - any likeness to Peter Falk's good-natured exaggerations as an "In-Law" - gets blasted away too. Although Pierce Brosnan remains stylishly good to look at throughout the movie, I emotionally turned away from him early in the action and just couldn't care any more.<br /><br />On the other hand, this movie certainly doesn't sustain any Sidney Lumet-like tone of gritty mean streets. The goofy unlikelihoods begin to pile up and interfere with any attempt in that direction. Brosnan is just too inept to be believable as a hit-man who could ever have been successful. A real hit-man would hardly hang around exchanging playground banter with a child, while staring obviously in the direction of his next victim. Nor would a real hit-man call attention to himself by traipsing through the lobby of a fancy hotel in only his very brief swimming briefs.<br /><br />Everyone's actions and motivations are jarringly unhinged here. Everyone is multiply hyphenated. Brosnan is a glamorous hit-man - perennially pathetic whorehouse john - loveable goofball - pedophile - cool cat - blubbering victim of mental breakdown. Kinear is an affable family man - ride-along assassin. Kinear's wife is a sweet wife - desperate housewife. And you can't excuse this mishmash by saying, "Well, everyone is a complex amalgam of many things." No, that just won't wash in this case.<br /><br />In one of the DVD's commentaries, the director/writer of this movie guffawingly admits that he jotted off the script for this film in a flash of improvisation. He threw together all sorts of elements of male fantasy, including the image of the matador - which really doesn't aptly serve as analogy to any of the actions or actors in the film. Although the movie is visually arresting - which is why I gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />But as for coherence or artistic vision - there's none here. It's as if someone took "The In-Laws" and "The Pawnbroker," threw them together in a Cuisinart, and hit "Shred."</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I Originally missed this movie in the theater, and I was dissapointed. So when it came out on DVD, I had to rent it. This is a Hilarious movie revolving around the life of a hitman, julian Noble (played by pierce brosnan), who is loosing his edge.  On a chance meeting in mexico Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear)happens to meet Noble at the hotel bar. Wright is a desperate business man (ad agent) attempting to get his upstart company going. Having tasted sucsess with a big firm, Wright had his life fall appart when his young son was killed by a car three years prior.  Wright is desperate to get his life, and marraige, heading in the right direction again. Noble is a man that has had one botched job as a hitman, and that is one to many, and he is struggling to keep going in the only job he knows.  Well, if you think the movie is predicatble, think again. Many twist take place in this film, and it drags your interest along with it.  The life of these two guys get entagled, by one little meeting.  This is a great movie, with humor and some sadness, arriving at a great ending for all.  So check it out.</p></br></body></html>

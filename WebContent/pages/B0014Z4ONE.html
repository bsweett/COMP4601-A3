These films waited a long time to make their bow on DVD, much too long for myself, personally. I always loved these films, they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time. Each of the three films is very different from the others. "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the first and best of the three, introduces us to Indiana Jones, perhaps Lucas's greatest creation. Premiering in 1981, this film was a smash, also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture. Also starring was Karen Allen, perhaps the most even-matched female co-star for Harrisan Ford. It seemed she could give as good she got, and never backed down in any scene. Second was "The Temple of Doom", easily the darkest of the three, and the most intensely exciting. This film is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish, and doesn't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor. The third film, "The Last Crusade", is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor, and has the wonderful Sean Connery to steal every scene he's in. The interaction between Indy and Mr. Jones is wonderful. If anyone was to ever play Indiana Jones' father, it was Sean Connery. The forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features, which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves. These films waited far too long to be released to DVD, and I lay the blame squarely on George Lucas. I've heard he really didn't think DVD would take off like it did, that it was just a phase. It's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy. As with his "Star Wars" trilogy, the Indiana Jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all DVD collections.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>The Indiana Jones trilogy contains some of the best adventure movies ever made. They all have a distinct plot but they all revolve around a very neat adventure that blends in bursts of comedy. Harrison Ford is great as Indy and the adventures never cease to amaze. Like the Back to the Future Trilogy, these movies sre for adults and children. Everyone will love these classics. The first one is the classic one becuase it started the series and the second incorporates lots of lava and some "nasty food." Also, look at the name of the club in the opening scene of the temple of doom. It's called club Obi-Wan. Get it? The last Crusade has also some comic moments like when Hitler signs Indiana Jone's book. Sean Connery adds a lot to that one!<br /><br />So, these are great adventure movies with some great comedy and will leave your whole family exited to watch the next in the trilogy. An then you'll just have to rewatch the whole trilogy again!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Raiders of the Lost Ark is on nearly every &quot;Best Movies Ever Made&quot; list in existence.  I have seen it more than any other film, probably 30 times or more, and I have seen it on small tv's with grainy VHS and up on the Huge Screen of the Fox Theater in Atlanta with 6 channel Dolby - and I have loved it every time.<p>It's hard to imagine more of a dream team of producer/director than George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and they put all their creative energies into producing an action/adventure movie that grabs you in the first moments and barely lets up until the credits roll.<p>The American Film Institute ranks it among the top 100 films of all time.  Roger Ebert numbers it among his Greatest Films.  I personally consider it the most rip-roarin' fun you can have in front of a movie screen. <p>Harrison Ford gives the performance of 100 lifetimes as Indiana Jones - AFI's #2 Screen Hero, right behind Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird and ahead of everybody else including James Bond and Bogart's Rick from Casablanca.  The supporting cast fills in every nook and cranny with performances that are a sheer pleasure to watch.  The special effects, done back in the days before Computer Generated stuff had been invented, will absolutely knock your socks off and in scene after scene I remember thinking &quot;how the heck did they DO that?&quot;  Moments that elicit a bemused grin earlier on are reprised on a larger scale later on in a way that stretches that grin from ear to ear, such as early on in &quot;Raiders&quot; when Indy tells his pilot, Jacques, that he &quot;HATES snakes&quot; as Jacques &quot;pet snake, Reggie&quot; is slithering across his lap.  Later on they discover that the highly sought-after Ark is stored in a room inhabited by probably the largest collection of snakes ever gathered.  &quot;Snakes...&quot; Harrison deadpans for our enjoyment. &quot;Why'd it hafta be snakes?&quot;  Fearless Indy's dread of snakes shows up in the second movie, then is entertainingly explained in the third. John William's score ices the whole thing.<p>At present time we can thankfully acquire the entire Indiana Jones Trilogy, BUT... if you only wanted one of the three movies you're out of luck.<p>Harrison Ford successfully reprises Indiana Jones in the other two movies, but neither quite reach the spectacular glory of &quot;Raiders&quot;.<p>&quot;Temple of Doom&quot; is the darkest of the three, with subplots involving enslaved children and human sacrifice, and Kate &quot;Mrs. Spielberg&quot; Capshaw is a good deal more shrill as the female lead than the spunky Karen Allen is in &quot;Raiders&quot;.<p>&quot;The Last Crusade&quot; comes midway between the two films in terms of sheer enjoyment and two good casting strokes were made with Sean Connery as Indy's Dad and the late River Phoenix as the young scout Indy. (We even get to see a fictionalized version of how Indy/Harrison got that scar on his chin, and why he hates snakes - the kind of entertaining fluorish that FILLS these movies.)<p>Sooooo.... in conclusion I think that this set is an absolute &quot;must have&quot;. There is a fourth disc in the set with little documentaries that answer those &quot;how did they DO that!?&quot; questions I had, but you the DVD buyer doesn't have much choice.  Maybe like the &quot;Godfather&quot; series there will be individual reissues of The Adventures of Indiana Jones.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>WOW!  George and Steven are two film making powerhouses.  When they merge, they bring together one phenomenal trilogy.<br />  The first and best installment in the Indiana Jones series is Raiders of the Lost Arc.  Ford really made an icon out of the action hero.  The action was wonderful.  The plot was very very good, and the acting was great.  It is one of the greatest films of all time.  A definate five star film<br />  The second and probably least impressive of the three is the Temple of Doom.  Too bad Marion, couldn't have been the Jones girl in this film, but Kate Capshaw played a really good role.  The effects were not as impressive as the first, and the plot was a little harder to believe, but it ultimately wasn't dissappointing.  3 Stars.<br />  The Last Crusade is the third installment into the trilogy.  It was definately better than the sequel, but still didn't equal up to the first installment.  Sean Connery was wonderful, who better play Ford's dad.  The effects were better.  And what better than to bring the Holy Grail into the trilogy.  Four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Lucasfilm took their sweet time putting out the original Indiana Jones trilogy on DVD. In fact, it wasn't until the Indy 4 rumors stopped looking so much as rumors and started to become a reality that the company released the Indiana Jones films for the first time on DVD in this rustic-looking box set.  With the advent of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, the movies have since been re-released on DVD (and slightly altered as well).  Many people won't mind those changes, but I enjoy watching the films the way I originally saw them in the theatres.<br /><br />This DVD set includes the first three Indiana Jones movies (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE) as well as an extra Bonus Material DVD that is full of extra features.  The set is worth buying for the three movies alone (now that the films have been re-released and are about to be re-re-released you can get this whole set cheaper). However, the extra special features DVD is a very nice addition.  The Bonus Material DVD includes several documentaries and featurettes including "The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones", "The Sound of Indiana Jones", "The Stunts of Indiana Jones", "The Music of Indiana Jones", "Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy", the trailers for all three films, and some bonus DVD-ROM content.  I especially enjoyed the "Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy" documentary.  It's very informative and actually feels like watching a documentary film.<br /><br />As already mentioned, you can purchase all of the Indiana Jones movies separately now and even get a new boxed set with all four Indiana Jones movies.  However, this is the DVD set that is the best set to own. Well, at least until Lucasfilm re-re-re-releases the movies in another few years in the Ultimate Indiana Jones DVD Box Set.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I bought the original box set many months ago on sale for a bargain price. Reading all the reviews for the new Indy installment, I wanted to watch the original 3 films again, before eventually seeing the new one. This box set contains the first 3 movies and an extra disc with a fair amount of extra material. The DVD's look and sound great and it has enough features on it to keep me happy until some day buying a "Blue Ray" version.<br /><br />Watching the original "Raiders" was quite fun as I haven't watched the film in years! The DVD transfer is excellent and the audio is more than adequate on the original 4 DVD box set release not the newest release. This film still holds up well and could be labeled the definitive action adventure film without any arguments.<br /><br />Ford is perfectly cast as the elusive whip-cracking archeologist and Allen is great as his very capable love interest. It's a one of kind film that has been copied so much it's hard to remember when this was fresh and new! The first film is the best by a mile, but I will be reviewing all the films as I watch them!<br /><br />1) Raiders Of The Lost Ark - 5 Stars<br />2) Temple Of Doom - 4 Stars<br />3) Last Crusade - 4 1/2 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>I love the Indiana Jones series. They were fantastic when they first came out, when I was a young teen, enjoying the fast paced action and sharp witty comments. They're equally great now that I'm older and can see the much deeper meaning in many of the interactions. The movie series does a fantastic job of both providing light, entertaining for the young ones as well as some quality character interactions for those who seek them.<br /><br />Harrison Ford shines in a role which, in the hands of another actor, might have turned into a cliche. Well, it IS a cliche in the sense that the adventure guy acts as if he's in a video game - running, jumping and shooting his way out of trouble. But he's so much more. He has his doubts, his weaknesses. He knows what he's doing is very risky, and he judges his chances with an experienced eye before leaping into the fray.<br /><br />I've seen these movies so many times that I'm very glad they're on DVD, where a tape is not wearing holes in it. There's always something new to spot in a situation. The little details tucked into the corners are just astounding.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended. This is a set that every home should own. You can pop it into the player at any time, with pretty much any crowd, and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>Since the invention of the dvd we've been waiting for this trilogy to be released, and now it finally has. But what can you say about it? It contains one of the classic heroes, one of the greatest films ever made, in fact one of the best trilogies we have and a bonus disk full of all kinds of great stuff. You have two of our best filmmakers coming together with one of our greatest actors. Classic stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>I've never seen DvD's restored tis well and I personally own many,many dvds.The picture quality is better than most films today. no artifacts or snow or anything You will be amazed how great the picture is.AS for the 5.1 DD surround its great two you cant tell it was made 20 years ago,the only complaint I have is the Diologe seems to be a bit muffuled it doesnt seem to match the music or sound effects it doesnt really take away from any thing becouse if your like me youll have these  movie's cranked up!!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg directed all three films in the Indiana Jones trilogy and he had help from George Lucas in making these comic-like fast paced action films primed for mainstream success.  Taking place between the 1930's and 40's, all three films feature professor and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford in the role he was born to play; hard to believe Tom Selleck was originally considered for the role) on various death defying adventures all over the world.  The first film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, features Jones attempting to stop the Nazis from getting the Lost Ark of the Covenent.  This film is probably the most exciting of the three, with some cleverly imaginitive special effects and all around spookiness.  The second film, Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom, is a prequel which finds Jones and two comrades (a young Asian boy and Kate Capshaw who is Mrs. Steven Spielberg) fighting against a cult who is enslaving Indian children.  This film wasn't too well received because of it's surprising violence, but it is my favorite of the trilogy and is loaded with suspense.  The third film, Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, finds Jones trying to save his father (Sean Connery) from a Nazi regime who are hellbent on finding the Holy Grail.  This installment is the most comic like of the three, and Ford and Connery are great together.  This much hyped about DVD set is definitely worth owning, but the DVD extras are extremely lacking (then again, this is Paramount after all).  A fourth film is rumored to be in the works, but until that ever sees the light of day, you should definitely pick up this set.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Being a big fan of the Indiana Jones films I find myself conflicted about this new box set. While it's no surprise that the studio decided to re-release the films to coincide with the release of the new Indy film, they have royally screwed over fans by including a new collection of extras thereby forcing them to buy the films over again if they want them. So, is it worth it? Short answer: no. Nothing is going to beat <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">The Adventures of Indiana Jones (Raiders of the Lost Ark/ Temple of Doom/ Last Crusade) - Widescreen Edition</a>'s two-hour making of documentary and many of these new extras are nothing more than left over bits from it.<br /><br />On the Raiders of the Lost Ark disc there is an "Introduction" that features Lucas and Spielberg talking about the genesis of the film. Spielberg wanted to do a globe-trotting James Bond-type story and Lucas introduced the idea of an archaeologist. They both agreed that they wanted to pay homage to the old 1930s cliffhanger sequels.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones: An Appreciation" was done on the set of the new Indy film as Lucas, Spielberg, Harrison Ford, and Karen Allen reflect on the character and the trilogy - its impact on them and popular culture. Cast and crew from the new film also give their impressions and everyone recounts their favourite scene from the trilogy.<br /><br />"The Melting Face" takes a look at how they pulled off the climactic scene when the Ark is opened and Toht's face melts. The effects artists who did it take us through the process and there is vintage footage of it being done.<br /><br />"Storyboard: The Well of the Souls" shows illustrations from this sequence with footage from the film to show how close the two match.<br /><br />There are "Galleries" that feature character sketches, props, behind-the-scenes photographs taken on the set, effects shots, like Matte paintings, and models used, various designs for the film's logo, and finally, posters from all over the world.<br /><br />The Temple of Doom disc features an "Introduction" by Lucas and Spielberg. The director says that he had always wanted to make a trilogy of films and Lucas wanted this one to be darker and edgier, like The Empire Strikes Back (1980). They admit that Temple of Doom got terrible reviews but at least Spielberg met his wife on that one - Kate Capshaw.<br /><br />"The Creepy Crawlies" examines how each film has some creepy element to it: Raiders with snakes, Temple of Doom with bugs, and the Last Crusade with rats. There are segments from each film are shown with a trivia track option.<br /><br />"Travel with Indy: Locations" examines the various exotic locales seen throughout the films. We see how Hawaii doubled for South America and so on. This featurette can also be viewed with an optional trivia track. Associate producer Robert Watts takes us through key locations while dishing production anecdotes.<br /><br />"Storyboards: The Mine Car Chase" allows you to view the illustrations for this sequence along with the actual scene from the film.<br /><br />The "Galleries" section is identical to the one on the Raiders disc only pertaining to Temple of Doom.<br /><br />The Last Crusade disc starts off with yet another "Introduction" where Spielberg admits that he wasn't crazy about the idea of the Holy Grail and suggested using it as a metaphor for the father-son relationship between Indy and his father. Lucas and Spielberg talk about the casting of Sean Connery and what he brought to the role.<br /><br />Easily the most entertaining and engaging extra of the entire set is "Indy's Women: The American Film Institute Tribute" reunites the leading ladies from each film: Karen Allen, Kate Capshaw and Alison Doody. They talk about their characters and working with Spielberg. They all look great and speak candidly about their experiences. In particular, Capshaw and Doody talk about the reaction to their characters.<br /><br />"Indy's Friends and Enemies" takes a look at the sidekicks, love interests, and villains in the trilogy. Spielberg speaks admiringly of the leading ladies and the strengths of each character. This featurette also explores the role sidekicks and villains play in the film with plenty of clips.<br /><br />"Storyboards: The Opening Sequence" shows the sketches for the film's exciting opening action sequence with a young Indy (Phoenix) alongside the actual scene in the film.<br /><br />Finally, the "Galleries" features a nice collection of snapshots from various aspects of the film like the galleries on the other discs.<br /><br />The extras on these discs are well done and interesting to watch but do not warrant you double-dipping unless you are a hardcore fan that MUST have everything. If this is the first time buying the Indy films and you don't know which set to get, purchase the first one because each film does not share disc space with extras and for the two-hour making of documentary which is superior to all of the extras on this new set combined.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>I read the first 70 reviews of the DVD 4-pack. I would like to comment on some comments.<p>1. Defective disks? All 4 of mine played flawlessly - on a $60 player.<br />2. Bad sound and picture? Mine looked and sounded great (although only on basic stereo TV).<br />3. Paper label on back cheap? Yep. Pulled it off and threw it away. So? Some other expensive DVD's I've bought came the same way.<br />4. Missing rat scene? Mine had it. A particular reviewer gave a 1-star rating based on a "missing" rat scene.<br />5. No commentary or deleted scenes? Nope. Some people seemed surprised (after they bought it). If you can't read an advertisement (or cheap paper label) BEFORE you buy something, perhaps you should not be trusted with a credit card.<br />Truthfully, commentaries are over-rated in general, although I like them. The problem is that the commentor is constrained by time as the movie plays along - should he only make short 5-second comments about obvious and insignificant things ("this is where the head explodes"), or a 2-minute oration about some specific point while the movie leaves him behind? The documentaries on the bonus disk allow as much time per subject as needed (more or less).<br />6. One "reviewer" said nothing about the movies or DVDs themselves but instead went off on a diatribe about how full-screen movies are in fact some kind of rip off due to "widescreen only" TV's in the next few years. Apparently (I'm inferring) this will cause (gasp!) black bars at the side of the screen rather than top. OK...<br />7. Another "reviewer" who has not actually seen the DVD's wrote about having to return them because he bought the full-screen version by mistake, not knowing there was a wide-screen version. Hmmm. It has "widescreen" or "full screen" in the title, too.<br />8. Another "reviewer" complained that he likes full-screen formats because he has a 4:3 TV and apparently the bars on widescreen versions are annoying. Did you know that if you had a widescreen TV, you would have plastic TV at the top and bottom instead of black bars and glass? This one made no sense, but he was from France, so OK:-)<br />9. The one guy I CAN relate to claimed this set was a rip-off because he only wanted ROTLA and thought the other movies were bad. I would not call it a rip off - you don't have to buy it, dude - but I,  too, was only interested in ROTLA, but figured the bonus material would be good enough to warrant the other disks. Just barely. ROTLA is excellent. TOD is almost unwatchable due to the character of the little kid. I thought LC was marginal, saved only because it had Nazi's again.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>Saturday-morning serials were, on the whole, awful. Cheaply made, with numbingly unimaginative and repetitive plots, they were filler that encouraged weekly movie attendance. A 15-part "thriller" could be cranked out for $100K to $250K (the total running time was rarely more than 90 minutes), so it easily returned its investment.<p>The worst thing about them was that, as "cliffhangers," very little actually hung over the cliff. The near-fatal situation the hero found himself in at the end of each episode was revealed at the beginning of the next to be not particularly threatening, as he (or she -- think of Pearl White) had gotten out of the way _before_ the explosion, gun shot, rock fall, car crash, etc, etc.<p>In one Buster Crabbe serial there's no way he can _possibly_ escape death -- and, indeed, the opening of the next episode is a complete reshoot that allows him an escape! Yet the kids never seemed to learn, and came back week after week. The two Superman serials -- why hasn't Warners reissued them on DVD? -- are well-above-average in this respect, as Supes could save the victim from just about any danger. Not to mention getting into a few tight spots himself.<p>"Raiders of the Lost Ark" was the Saturday-morning cliffhanger serial millions of kids deserved, but never got. It's the epitome of this genre, and is unlikely ever to be exceeded, let alone equalled. It delivers the real thrills those cheap serials didn't, and remains a hoot, especially when the Nazis get what they so richly deserve at the end.<p>Opinions on the sequels vary. "Temple of Doom" is a terrific adventure film, but many viewers objected to its dark tone (which was Spielberg's and Lucas's intent -- they didn't want to repeat the first film). Its real problem isn't the violence (it's no more violent than "Raiders," which initially received an R rating for Belloc's head explosion), but its lack of any dramatic substance. It's 95% action -- there's little personal interaction or conflict. (Classic-serial fans will note that most of the "gags" are taken from a Republic serial, "Manhunt of Mystery Island." Which is one of the serials trashed in Firesign Theater's "Hot Shorts." It, too, deserves a DVD issue.)<p>Anyone who doesn't enjoy "The Last Crusade" is nuts, because we have the great fun of seeing Sean Connery as Indy's father. Connery is that rare combination of a really good actor _and_ a legitimate "movie star," who steals every scene he's in. "Crusade" lacks the startling novelty of "Raiders," but it's the best-plotted of the three films, tightly connecting the Grail search with Indy's and his father's lives.<p>The transfers are wonderful, especially "Raiders," which has never looked so vivid and rich. Spielberg and Lucas haven't altered the films, not even changing the title card of the first (which now "officially" has the "Indiana Jones and the..." prefix). Nor, alas, have the special effects been redone. You can still see the matte/Rotoscope lines, which are especially noticeable in the "supernatural" effects at the end of "Raiders." Considering the extensive (and sometimes unwelcome) changes Spielberg made to "E. T.", this is surprising.<p>The Indiana Jones movies are three wonderful excuses for fattening yourself on popcorn. The real stuff, not microwave.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>As you have probably already read, the DVD set is a little light when it comes to the extras. However, the transfer on the films themselves is amazing! The picture and sound quality is so good, that it is almost unreal. This DVD set is truly a must buy for any fans of Indiana Jones or of action films in general.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark<p>"Raiders of the Lost Ark" is the best film of the trilogy in my opinion. We get to see the loveable, bullwhip-cracking, archeologist Indiana Jones for the first time. Harrison Ford was the perfect choice for the role of Indiana Jones, and he gave the best performance of his career. Karen Allen is outstanding as Indy's love interest Marion Ravenwood. I love how she can powerdrink any man under the table, and actually gets involved in the story. Allen did not play the typical " damsel in distress" which made the role so good. Only Steven Spielberg could have created a masterpiece like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". The non stop action, special effects, overall story, and acting are all top notch. Indiana Jones is one of the most memorable characters to ever come out of Hollywood. <p>The Temple of Doom<p>"Temple of Doom" is obviously the second film of the trilogy. People often criticize this film very heavily. While it was not as good as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", it is still extremely enjoyable in my opinion. Steven Spielberg, despite the opinions of others, did a good job with this film. It is much darker than Raiders which makes it somewhat original. It is also funnier, and has some very suspenseful scenes! The one that comes to mind, is Indy and company jumping out of the plane on the raft, and sliding down the mountain. The action is non stop and the acting is good all around. Also, I love the visuals for this film. Underneath the palace in the caverns especially. You also get a first hand look at the wilderness of India. Temple of Doom is not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but still very enjoyable and fun to watch. Kate Capshaw was the film's only downfall, because she spends the majority of the film whining about bugs, getting wet, etc. Sometimes you just want Indy to tell her to shut up. Suprisingly, the film's best role behind Harrison Ford, Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round. He is mainly known for his role as Data in "The Goonies". This kid did an amazing job and will have you laughing for the majority of the film.<p>The Last Crusade<p>"The Last Crusade" is almost as good as "Raiders of the Lost Ark". The overall story, non stop action, and father/son relationship between Ford and Connery really make it a treat to watch. Harrison Ford is back for a third time, as the loveable bullwhip-cracking archeologist Indiana Jones, and he does a great job once again. The thing that I really love about this film, we get to see more than one side of the character and look into Indy's past. River Pheonix had a nice cameo as the young Indy. I liked how we got to see how Indiana Jones came to be. Sean Connery is one of Hollywood's true legends. He steps up and really nails the role of Henry Jones. His obsessive nature over the grail is great, and how can you not love the relationship between Indy and his dad. " I told you...don't call me Junior!!!"</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>Finally, the Indian Jones Trilogy has made it to DVD.  And it was worth the wait!  With amazing picture quality, superb sound, and a few nice touch-ups thrown in throughout the series (one notable example being the snake/glass scene in "Raiders") this DVD set is definitely worth its meager price.  All of the special features are contained on a fourth DVD with three extensive "Making of..." documentaries on each film.  Additionally, a few short featurettes are included on various aspects of the technical crew, from stunts to sound.  The documentaries are very interesting to watch for anyone who loves the films.  One learns all sorts of interesting facts and trivia and gets to watch footage from the filming sessions.  It's nice to see how the idea started small and developed into a gigantic success.<p>That being said, it's disappointing that there aren't more special features to be had in this set.  I would have liked to have seen Director's commentaries on each film and deleted scenes.  This set definitely does not have some of the extra features that other sets include, but the documentaries make up for this fact to a certain extent.  <p>All in all, what's really worth the price of this set are the restored films.  Having seen these movies only on VHS and TV myself, it was stunning to see them without any defects or tracking lines.  And the sound blew me out of my seat.  One can really gain an appreciation for the sound effects editing and the score with this release.  At a price of just $15 a film (plus the extra DVD with the documentaries), this set is definitely worth the investment and should be in everyone's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Based on Movie and TV serials from the 1930s-50s these films are made with love and imagination. Anytime you put Steven Spielberg and George Lucas together on a project you can expect great things. Add the music of John Williams and the wonderful cast including Harrison Ford and you have three magical movies. To me these and the original Star Wars became instant family classics.<p><p>This DVD set is INCREDIBLE. The making of documentaries are fascintating. Little tidbits of additional information like the R2D2 and C3PO hieroglyphs, the glass separating the cobras from the actors, and Harrison Ford hurting himself being ran over by the plane in Raiders makes it very special. The stars, directors, and others that help make the movies tell about how it all came together in a fascinating story. Thats just the making of extras, I can't begin to list everything else. And by the way the picture and sound quality of the DVDs is incredibly sharp and clear.<p>When I first viewed the first Indiana Jones movie I was captivated. I couldn't wait to see the live cast Indiana Jones show at DisneyWorld. It was incredible with all the stunts and even a  plane and the fight scene with the German as the plane rotates with propellers threatening just like the movie.<p>The Adventures of Indiana Jones set will gather little dust on anyones shelf. The whole family and visiting friends will get hours of entertainment out of them. With all the additional features this set offers it will take either some intense non-stop marathon viewing for a day or several partial days of fun.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark broke the mold of adventure movies as Star Wars did for SciFi movies. There had not been anything like the scope it offered and there has not been since. We all have other movies we enjoy in the same genre, but most would agree that this Trilogy offers the best of all others. <p>It is like taking a dash of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca, a sprinkle of Steve McQueen in Great Escape, and a couple of cups of all the wonderful adventure movies of the past and baking the best apple pie movie you have ever tasted with your eyes and ears.<p>I pre-ordered my set as soon as they were advertised and my wife and I are practically drooling in anticipation. Look around at prices of sets of movies and you will see this is by far the best set for the money even without all the wonderful extras they are including. Not sure what a family member, friend, or even your boss might like for Christmas? Buy this set for them and you will be remembered warmly forever.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Raiders of the Lost Ark-The one to start it all, there's no experience quite like watching this film for the very first time. This movie's got it all: exotic and mysterious settings, close calls, elaborate booby traps, shootouts, fistfights, chases, and that joyous sense of awe and discovery.  The movie's standout sequence is the famous desert chase, with Indy hanging off the side of the side, in front of, below, and behind a Nazi truck!  With all the fantastic action and stunts, it's even more amazing that what makes Raiders stand out is Harrison Ford's perfect performance.  John Williams' rousing score makes the already thrilling action scenes even more exciting.<br />*****/*****<p>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom-The first of the Indy sequels has caught an undeserved rep.  Much like say, The Matrix Reloaded, the consensus is that this is a good, solid sequel, but good is disappointing when compared to the ground-breaking original.  But I'm afraid I can't agree.  Even though Temple of Doom boasts a slightly less solid plot than Raiders of the Lost Ark, this is an even faster-paced, equally wonderful movie experience.  Harrison Ford matches his first performance with a touch more humor and he's got a great sidekick in Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), a young Chinese kid who holds his own next to Indy.  John Williams' score is somehow even better and the action setpieces are eye-poppingly spectacular.  Not only are there the "usual" shootouts and fistfights, Jones is also trapped in a mid-air freighter with no fuel, goes through a literal rollercoaster ride on a mine cart, and literally hangs off a cliff with hungry alligators below!  The last half-hour is just non-stop excitement, the greatest extended action sequence in cinematic history.<br />*****/*****<p>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade-My personal favorite of the series, Indy's quest for the Holy Grail is the most fun one can have watching a movie. Except for the climactic tank chase, none of the action here really surpases what was accomplished in Temple of Doom  in terms of sheer thrills (though a motorcycle chase and zeppelin battle come close), but that's okay.  The point of The Last Crusade is that it intends to be a more mature and character-oriented addition to the trilogy.  The addition of Sean Connery was a brilliant movie; he makes a wonderful dramatic and comedic duo with Harrison Ford.  Ford, in particular, delivers the best and most difficult performance of his career.  Difficult, you say, but he's just reprising a role he's played twice before, right?  True, but this time he has to craft Jones as a character with his own flaws and demons (exemplified by his strained relationship with his father) while still maintaining the larger-than-life action heroics.  He pulls it off with flying colors.<br />*****/*****<p>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the trilogy remains the greatest example of Hollywood movie magic, proving the filmmaker's talents for recreating the sense of joy that we all thought we could only feel as children.  Nice to see there's someone out there who knows how to make us feel like kids again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Amazon has this set for the best price. I have shopped online and around at stores, but Amazon has them beat by at least $5.00. This is the best action/adventure series out there that the whole family can watch. I find it hard to believe there is a soul alive that hasn't seen them and loved them. If so here is a short synopsis.<p>1. The first movie starts out with a clever superimposing of the Paramount logo before a mountain in the movie. Indiana has to avoid traps in a South American temple and excape with a golden idol. He then tracks down a old girl friend and her father in Nepal for a relic to lead him to the Ark of the Covenant. He must search a tomb and then fight Nazis in order to try and retrieve it. God has the last word and the Nazis get a lesson in religion they won't forget. My favorite by far since there is so much here to enjoy.<br />2.Indiana goes to India and tries to help some villages recover their children and religious stones. Once again he travels around the world. It comes down to him as good against a evil cult leader that requires Indiana style convincing with some assistance from his small side kick, short round, and his girl friend. Oriented a little more towards kids with his sidekicks age, and lots of creepy bats, bugs, and a roller coaster ride in a mining car.<br />3. Indiana gets together with his dad to track down the Holy Grail. Once again the Nazis get in his way. The search takes us all over with great scenery and interesting story line of medieval and religious history. At first we are not aware of the clever female being involved with both son and father, but when we find out how. Well lets just say a fine sense of humor. Ford and Connery are great together. Indy travels all over to find clues to the grail's whereabouts. Indiana must avoid the traps of the tomb containing the Grail in order to save his fathers life, it is action packed to the last. The special effects in all these movies are great. Order them now!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>This movie trilogy is a threesome pack of three unforgettable action/adventure movies that feature our beloved archaeologist. All three of the movies are tremendous classics all in their own right. Each one of them are unique and different from each other. The outstanding scripts of George Lucas and the incredible directing of Steven Spielberg all combine to create a totally awesome movie trilogy. <p>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK: This first entry in the movie series is probably the most loved of all the three. This one finds Jones going after a religious artifact called the Ark, while staying at least one step ahead of Nazi explorers and a rival archaeologist associated with them named Belloq, who are also after it. Marion Ravenwood was Jones&#65533; love in this movie. She was funny, and intelligent and sexy in a way because of her strong attitude. For me, I like rebellious women in action/hero movies. The villainous Toht was unforgettable, being played by the late Ronald Leacy who passed away ten years after this movie. Belloq was an awesome villain. They have no idea of what&#65533;s in store for them when they get to the Ark&#65533;s power. This is my favorite movie from 1981. There are some incredibly funny scenes too from time to time. <p>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM: This second entry in the series is the most controversial of the three but for me, this is probably tied with the first one as my second favorite. This one brings Jones out of Nazi-controlled Germany to the dark underground caverns of a religious cult called the Thuggie Cult lead by Mola Ram. Jones&#65533; love though in this one was Willie Scott, a famous singer from Shanghai, China. Willie in my opinion was relatively irritating with her excessively helpless character but occasionally showed some toughness but overall was nowhere near as good as Marion was. &#65533;Temple Of Doom&#65533; caused controversy with moviegoers saying that it was much more violent and negatively portrayed the Indians as bloodthirsty and hateful and then British come and save the day. To that, I say GARBAGE! European colonists killed numerous tribal populations during the past 500 years in North America (Native Americans, Aztecs), South America(Mayan, Brazilian tribes) and Australia(Aboriginals) so basically every nationality in the world has been the villain and the hero at different times. Don&#65533;t listen to these detractors. About the more violent atmosphere, with movies that are loaded with extremely graphic content, this movie now is pretty much lightweight. Despite all the controversy, this movie was a winning successor to Raiders. The action scenes and funny lines made &#65533;Temple Of Doom&#65533; every bit as entertaining as &#65533;Raiders&#65533; was. Even Willie was funny at times too. <p>INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE: This is by far my favorite of the combo. This movie brings the series full circle back to the Nazi-controlled Germany on two missions: Find his missing father and also to find a religious artifact called the Holy Grail. Jones and his father Henry Jones Sr. now are on a dangerous quest to beat the Nazis and their leader Walter Donavan to the Grail before they get their hands on it and gain immortality but all of them have no idea of the powers that they are coming to grips with and also learn the price of immortality. This time though, the woman love is actually a villainess named Esla Scheider who is also associated with the Nazi&#65533;s. Elsa is my opinion wasn&#65533;t as strong as Marion was but was miles above Willie Scott in my opinion. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford play the best father/son movie duo that I&#65533;ve ever seen and I guess that one is never too old to be a hero. There are also a lot of humorous lines interwoven within the action scenes too. We also see how Indiana got the fedora, whip and the scar. &#65533;The Last Crusade&#65533; brought this dynamite movie trilogy to a top rate conclusion.<p>This is a fantastic movie gift set with three unforgettable classics. There is the possibility of a fourth Indiana Jones movie in the near future. If it does come to fruition, it&#65533;s unlikely that Marcus Brody will be returning as Denholm Elliot who played him is now deceased but most of the rest of the permanent characters will return. Anyhow, this trilogy set is a marvelous purchase as you get all three of the movies all in one box. Now that&#65533;s a hefty purchase!</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This will be another classic movie done by Steven Speilberg. Jones is approached by federal government representatives to help locate the Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis (Hitler) are also looking for the Ark. Jones starts  out on his mission in search of the prize. He goes through several near  death scenarios before ending up in the desert. There the Ark is found by  Jones and his small crew. They are in turn captured by the Nazis. All of  this leads up to the exciting ending. The Nazis get the final shock opf  their lives when they open up the  Ark. A very good ending to a very good  movie. This movie is very picturesque with the use of the desert scenes.  Like I said before a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>Now where is the DVD?  These movies are all terrific, with Raiders being the best by far.  By the way, to all those who were upset about the title  being changed to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, fear no  more.  That title is only on the box.  The title on the screen is still the  same as it was in 1981 (The same can't be said for the title of Star Wars  -- they added Episode IV: A New Hope on the re-release prints, but I didn't  notice any complaints about that.) Raiders of the Lost Ark, one of the all  time greatest adventure movies and a major classic.  It is a must-see like  the 1933 King Kong and Casablanca. Temple of Doom isn't as good.  The story  is weaker, the heroine this time is a whiner, but the special effects are  impressive and the pace is breath-taking.  Watch it as a B-Movie on a  double-bill with Gunga Din. Last Crusade again isn't quite as good as  Raiders, but it is an improvement over Temple of Doom.  Sean Connery is  great as Indy's dad, but Brody, who was intelligent and quick in Raiders,  has somehow been transformed into an absent minded professor.  What was  missing from this movie was the sinister element.  In Raiders you got the  impression that Indiana could sacrifice Marion in favor of the Ark, Marion  could give up Indy for Belloq or freedom, Sallah could choose to betray  Indy.  The loyalties and nobility of the characters were left in doubt  until the end.  Only when Sallah sees Indiana and Marion onto  Katanga's  boat in Raiders do we know that he is truly loyal.  In Last Crusade, there  is never any doubt.  Indiana isn't as cold-hearted, he seems to know more  languages than in Raiders, Sallah's loyalties we are now familiar with, and  Marion isn't even in the picture, replaced with another archeologist who we  find out rather early on is traitorous, so the audience is left with a fun  adventure movie without as much character-driven suspense. So even though  only the first one is a true classic, get all three for a great  popcorn-munching time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>I know this is the VHS version, but I must ask where the DVD is?  I am aware that there are something like 600 million VCRs in homes across the US and only about 3 million DVD players (*currently) ... however, as a DVD  owner, I feel left out with the release of the INDIANA JONES VHS set.  I  just don't want to spend $30-something on tapes that I'll eventually  replace with a DVD -- whenever it is Lucasfilm releases it!  The Indiana  Jones trilogy are my favorite movies.  I WANT to own them.  But I'm afraid  I must practice patience (or &quot;count to 10&quot; as Indy's pop would  say ... although I think the DVD release is more than &quot;10&quot; away  ...)  My favorite is RAIDERS.  I love the way TEMPLE OF DOOM switches  gears.  And CRUSADE is fun, but ultimately unmemorable.  Now ... if only I  could view them in widescreen DVD (with extras, please, Mr. Lucas!)  tick  ... tick ... tick ...</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>I LOVED the first 'Indy' adventure.  It was a throwback to the old classic serials and reminded us all why the movies have been an important part in our lives.  "I HATE SNAKES!!!" will always remain one of my favorite quotes.  'Temple of Doom' was still pretty good, but excessively violent (one reason for the PG13 rating).  'Doom' has one helluva rollercoaster type ride through a mine shaft that ends up on a falling rope bridge.  This is exciting stuff.  By the time 'Crusade' came out, the cast was older, and the action seemed tamed.  The focus was on the comical bantering with father and "Junior" and not what made the other two great action films.  Still, if you are alone in the house and its raining, this trilogy is a great way to pass the day away.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>"Raiders" is still a wild ride nearly a quarter-century after its original release. Indiana Jones, professor of archaeology, goes after the Lost Ark of the Covenant with his lost love Marian (Karen Allen) who's anything but the stereotypical damsel in distress. Marian is as tough as Indy - this tough adventuress who wins drinking contests against the best doesn't wait to be rescued but kicks behind on her own. Cheer for the heroes, hiss the nasty Nazi bad guys, and shudder over the snakes! "The Temple of Doom", while not as good as its predecessor "Raiders" created a sensation on its release since the violence was rather extreme for the usually mild Spielberg-Lucas duo. Kate Capshaw's character of Willie is a bit annoying in her whininess, but little Short Round more than makes up for her. "Last Crusade" gives us the immortal Sean Connery as Indy's staid professor father and reunites us with John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott. Perhaps the best of the series, the Joneses go off for the ultimate prize - the Holy Grail! The one-liners are priceless and this set is a must-have for fans of Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and timeless, thrilling adventure as Hollywood used to make it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>In 1975 Steven Speilberg took you into a sea of terror, in 1977 George Lucas took you into a galaxy full of heroes,villians and many creature species.

The greatest adventure films of all time that truly embody Hollywood history are on DVD, All 3 of Indy's epic adventures, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Now bring home these classic treasures because theres no adventure hero like Indiana Jones. I'm thrilled for Indy's 4th adventure. If you have never seen these movies and your an adventure fan, well your missin out on adventure masterpieces that has a household name and pop culture icon. These films spawned the TV series Young Indiana Jones and two Disney theme parks; Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spetacular in WDW and Indiana Jones Adventure in Disneyland. Bring home the legendary adventures of the legendary Indiana Jones. These are treasures you been waiting to open.

Since the advent of the Digital Video Disc format in the late 1990s, there have been two long-awaited movie trilogies: the Classic Star Wars films and the Adventures of Indiana Jones.  (...) fans now at least have something to celebrate with the four-disc Indiana Jones set.<p>The Adventures of Indiana Jones consists of the first three films of the George Lucas-Steven Spielberg collaborative creation, 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Rounding out the set is the Bonus Material disc, which includes making-of documentaries, featurettes, trailers, and links to the Indiana Jones DVD site.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark, by far, is the best of the three films. Inspired by the serial films of the 1930s and '40s, it was actually one of the two projects conceived by George Lucas in the 1970s after he wrapped up American Grafitti in 1972.  One was a space-fantasy adventure inspired by Flash Gordon, and the other was the more Earthbound archeologist/adventurer named (at first) Indiana Smith. Of course, Lucas developed the Star Wars concept first, but even as he and Spielberg were vacationing in Hawaii in the summer of 1977, Lucas pitched his idea of the raiders of the Lost Ark as the two filmmakers built a sand castle on the beach.<p>Based on a concept by Phil Kaufman, Lucas' story and the screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan pit the daring archeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Nazis and Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), a rogue French archeologist who has a habit of crossing paths with Indy and often beating him to other coveted relics.  Hired by the U.S. government to locate an item called "the headpiece of the staff of Ra" after Army Intelligence intercepts a Nazi message which ties the piece to Abner Ravenwood, a former mentor of Indy's, our hero deduces that the Germans are really looking for the Lost Ark of the Covenant.  Soon Indy is in a race against time and a horde of Nazi spooks and soldiers to find one of the greatest religious artifacts of all time before it can be taken to Adolf Hitler himself.  Aided by his mentor's daughter (and former lover) Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and his loyal Egyptian friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies, who has also starred as Gimli in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy), Indy risks life and limb on his daring raid for the Lost<br />Ark.<p>1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, with a story by Lucas and a screenplay by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, is a darker chapter in the series.  On a quest for several missing Sankara stones in India, Indy and his companions Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) encounter a dangerous cult of Thugees based in Pankot Palace. Its very scary scenes (including a really gross banquet and a human sacrifice)caused an uproar that led to the creation of the PG-13 rating.  It's still quite a thrill ride, but many fans consider this as the weakest and least involving film in the Indiana Jones series.<p>Audiences fared better with 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Spielberg, working from a screenplay by writer Jeffrey Boam and a story by Lucas and Menno Meyjes, harkened back to the first Raiders film and evoked its mixture of thrills, chills and laughs and added a father-and-son dynamic with the casting of Sean Connery as Dr. Henry Jones, Sr.  Although once again Indy faces off against Nazis on a search for a religious relic -- in this case, the Holy Grail -- and there are cliffhangers galore, it's the relationship between Connery and Ford's characters that makes Last Crusade more than a pale rehash of the first movie.  Starting with a prologue featuring the late River Phoenix as young Indiana Jones (which explains our hero's choice of outfit, his phobia of snakes, and the scar on his chin) and ending with a ride-off-into-the-sunset credits sequence, Last Crusade is one of the best adventure movies ever made.<p>With great casts, amazing stunts and effects, thrilling scores by John Williams, and deft directing by Spielberg, these three films defined adventure films in the 1980s and their popularity still resonates more than 20 years after the premiere of Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br /><br />About the DVDs: I think they are good. They have been digitally remastered and given the "royal treatment" by Lucasfilm and Paramount.  The menus are astonishing, and the sound mix is good.  I can only speak for myself and not for other fans who, judging by other reviews, have been disappointed by this collection of long-awaited films.  True, there is no audio commentary by George Lucas and/or Steven Spielberg, but no DVD of a Spielberg film (and I have several in my collection) has that feature.  It's something Spielberg hates doing ("Now, in this scene, watch how I cleverly made a reference to Raiders' famous 'Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword!' ") and it's not really necessary, even for students of film.  I have discovered that director's commentary is worthwhile if the director and others involved in the track actually have something meaningful to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>Growing up, these were among some of my favorite movies to watch!

That doesn't bother me that much and so I found this collection to be a real treat.  The sound quality has clearly benefitted from the THX mastering and the 5.1 surround option completes the viewing experience.  Included is a fourth disc of bonus materials and all four discs fit well into a neat, well designed slipcase.  After viewing this again recently, I've discovered that the films have aged a little and so have lost some of their entertainment value although I thought "The Last Crusade" was still a very good movie to watch and to a lesser extent so was "Raiders of the Lost Ark" but "Temple of Doom" is clearly the weakest of the lot.  I recall that I didn't enjoy it as much when I first saw it in the theatres way back when and sure enough it hasn't aged well and I have to say I still didn't enjoy it watching it again this time around.  Overall though, this is a good way to kick back and escape every now and then.  This pack is a well produced version of all three films in the standard dvd format and I wonder how much better the Blu-ray version will be when they finally get around to releasing that.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I've just seen the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" disc from here on a Blu-ray player that enhances standard discs to 1080p and boy is the difference stunning!

I think I won't need to "upgrade" to a Blu-ray version after watching this!<br /><br />Just seen the other two and ditto with respect sound and picture quality for both.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>If you're looking to own the complete Indiana Jones saga, this is a good place to start: not only does it include all three of the original '80's movies (1981, 1984, and 1989), but a fourth disc packed with over three hours of bonus material.  The first, defining film, originally titled "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (more recent rereleases add Indy's name to the title) is set in 1936 and finds archaeologist, adventurer, and "obtainer of rare antiquities" Dr. Indiana Jones approached by two government agents searching for information on the "headpiece of the Staff of Ra," an artifact currently being sought by the Nazis.  Hitler is "a nut" on the occult and has agents running all over Europe (and other places) trying to gather up artifacts that may possess unusual powers; they've found the lost city of Tanis, Egypt, where the Hebrew Ark of the Covenant is hidden, but without the headpiece they can't find out exactly where.  So Indy sets out to recover it first, helped by Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), his former girlfriend, whose father originally collected it, and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), the British-educated "best digger in Cairo."  Opposing them are Indy's long-time rival Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), a Nazi spy named Toht (Ronald Lacey), and Col. Dietrich (Wolf Kahler).  But the Ark may not need human help to defend it--and it doesn't like Nazis at all.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom" is a much darker movie (much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006VIXGQ">Star Wars, Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back (Widescreen Edition)</a>, the middle episode of George Lucas's other famous trilogy, was much darker than either of the other two), set about a year before "Raiders."  We find Indy in Shanghai, where an attempt to collect pay due him from local gangster Lao Che (Roy Chiao) throws him and his 10-year-old sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) together with cabaret singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw).  When their plane is forced down over northern India, Indy is asked by the inhabitants of a native village to recover a sacred stone that has been stolen from them by the maharajah of Pankot Palace.  This stone may well be even more powerful than the villagers believe: the theft, it turns out, was engineered by a resurgent cell of Thuggee led by Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), who knows exactly what they're really capable of and plans to use them to rule all India.  When Indy discovers a maze of catacombs deep beneath the palace, a wild adventure ensues full of human sacrifice, enslaved children, and narrow escapes.  In this adventure Indy's character is more mercenary than he seems in the others; the prospect of "fortune and glory" excites him even more than finding antiquities (or "the search for fact," as he defines archaeology in "Last Crusade").  And many viewers dislike Willie, who spends a lot of time screaming or grousing about the hardships she's subjected to--but it's worth keeping in mind that, unlike Marion, she hasn't spent her life tramping all over the world learning to be tough and self-sufficient.<br /><br />The third episode, "Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade," jumps forward to 1938; Indy receives a strange package in the mail which proves to be the "Grail diary" kept for some 35 years by his father, Medieval-history professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who has been trying for most of his life to find the Holy Grail.  Soon afterward he's approached by millionaire Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), who has discovered clues to the Grail's location and had Prof. Jones working on the search until he "disappeared."  As Indy travels from Venice to Vienna to a hidden temple deep in the Mideastern desert, he not only finds his missing father but discovers plots and betrayals coming thick and fast.  (This may be my favorite of the trilogy: not only is Indy reunited with his friends Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Sallah, but the quirky relationship between him and his father is wonderfully portrayed.)<br /><br />The bonus material includes trailers for all three movies, featurettes on the stunts, music, sound, and "light and magic" (optical and mechanical SFX), and a set of shorts on how the movies were made, with interview appearances by Lucas, Spielberg, John Williams, Connery, Rhys-Davies, Allen, Ke, Ben Burtt, and various other persons important to the realization of the Jones legend.  And although the movies were quite unashamedly made in imitation of the classic 1930's Saturday-afternoon adventure serials, they're no less exciting--and believable--for all that: so well do cast and crew do their work that suspension of disbelief is very easy.  Anyone who loves good old-fashioned adventure should have them on the shelf.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Any Indiana Jones freak or ardent fan has to purchase this deluxe boxset of one of the greatest movie franchises in film history.

With action packed cliffhangers every turn and the motherload of archaeological artifacts, how can you not enjoy this tribute to the serials of yesteryear? George Lucas and Steven Spielberg created Indiana Jones, Lucas for the nostalgic throwback and Spielberg because he's always wanted to direct a James Bond film (he'd probably be better than the ones we've been getting). Ford abandons his blaster and Millenium Falcon for a fedora and bullwhip, and he's the only one I can see doing this role. Karen Allen is feisty as Marion, who is not your typical damsel in distress. Paul Freeman is charmingly evil as Belloq but at least has ulterior motives when compared to the Nazis. Ronald Lacey I recognized from two (great) episodes of The Avengers and his character in this reminds me of his insane portrayal of one of his characters from that show (Emma Peel episode The Joker). And John Rhys-Davies is a delight as Sallah, a very funny character. The story is very well done, with the Ark displaying only a bit of its ominence in certain scens until the very end. The action sequences, like Lucas' first three Star Wars films, can't be topped, even by today's standards because most, if not all of it, would be CGI. Some of my favorite sequences are the opening sequence in the temple, the fight at the Nazi airstrip and the subsequent chase on horseback. And the incomprable John Williams again delivers an excellent score, giving us another memorable theme, The Raiders March. 5 stars.<br /><br />The Temple of Doom- Despite being the highest grossing movie (worldwide) of 1984, a lot of people have had mixed feelings about this one. I on the other hand, like the darker storyline. While there is plenty of action for which the series is known, this is more of a character/story driven plot. Ford gives Indy more depth, especially when he drinks the blood of the Kali and his concern for Short Round (who is one of the few child characters in a film that actually adds to the story instead of slowing it down). Kate Capshaw's character however is no that helpful as Karen Allen's was of the previous film. The most she does is scream and complain but the character does show a little evolution during the course of the film. Amrish Puri is definately more evil than the Nazis of this and the next film, able to take out a person's heart and sitll leave them alive. The plot device (the Sankara Stones and later the Thuggee cult) is more creative and inventive than just having it be about Christian religious artifacts. The action sequences are on par with those of the first film, the climatic mine cart chase being one of the best. And once again John Williams gives an excellent score, providing a more sinister touch to the film. 5 stars.<br /><br />The Last Crusade- Combining, I think, elements of the first two films (more so the first than second), this is my personal favorite of the franchise. In the opening we see a young Indy involved in one of his first adventures and we discover his fear of snakes, where he picked up the bullwhip and the fedora. The rest of the film is solid. Indy is recruited by Walter Donovan (played by Julian Glover with, in my opinion, a convincing American accent) to search for the Holy Grail after his father (played by Sean Connery in a very comedic role). Assisted by Marcus Brody and Sallah (Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies respectively from the first film) and aided by the mysterious Elsa Schneider, Jones sets out to rescue his stubborn father. There are four former Bond actors in this film; Connery (of course), Allison Doody (Jenny Flex in A View To A Kill), John Rhys-Davies (General Pushkin in The Living Daylights) and Julian Glover (Kristatos in For Your Eyes Only and, interestingly, General Veers from The Empire Strikes Back). All play their parts well, especially the father/son dynamic. Connery and Ford have great chemistry together, one of my favorite scenes being when they're tied back to back in the castle and the room catches on fire and they both call each other. The story is great. Though the main objective for both parties is the Grail, it serves as a metaphor between father and son. Though I am suprised at how we portray God as peace loving yet all of these Christian artifacts are very destructive. Again the action sequences are excellent, some of my favorites being the aerial dogfight and the attack in the desert. Another brilliant John Williams score. Definately one of the better action movies that seamlessly blends in comedic moments. 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>In the unlikely event that you have just returned from a twenty five year self-imposed exile in The People's Republic Of China or from an extended mission to the red planet,then you will want to introduce yourself to this new edition of the single most successful adventure fantasy trilogy of all time (well, at least until the recent introduction of Lord Of The Rings).  Needless to say, this edition is well worth the money. Not only is the action in each of the three movies non-stop, but also the stories themselves are well-conceived and the dialogue well written, while the erstwhile cast in each does a splendid job of supporting Harrison Ford in his many memorable escapades. <p>As he did with the Star Wars saga, George Lucas acts as the producer for the epics, employing his good friend Steven Spielberg to direct the films and breathe the kind of exciting life into them that propels them forward with verve, excitement, and a tongue-in-cheek resolve. Who can forget the anti-hero anti of Ford simply shooting a swordsman rather than duel with him, or the several deadly encounters he has with snakes (as he tells us again and again, he HATES snakes!).  The movies are mostly about Ford, as a typical throwback to the reckless daring-do type hero of the B-movies of the WWII era, and the fact that he succeeds so magnificently in his characterization of Indiana as an almost believable figure who is at the same time larger than life is a credit to his acting skills and his sheer animal magnetism. <p>The compiled DVD is replete with special features, and the quality of the print makes it a great improvement over the original VHS format, which was much more primitive technologically. The sound is greatly enhanced, all the way to the audible hissing of the damned snakes, and with the inclusion of many scenes, there are many reasons to order and own this version of the timeless classic, especially given the fact that all three movies are included. Get ready for some great entertainment, and pop up the popcorn! Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>After a long wait, this box set finally came out on DVD in October of 2003 and it looks great!  Now, the next step will be to see these fun movies on Blu-Ray!<br /><br />All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but the first one - Raiders Of The lost Ark - was still the best. Over 25 years later, it still has some very memorable scenes, like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Harrison Ford to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened.<br /><br />Years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.The action scenes are varied. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here.<br /><br />The next two Indiana films were almost as good, and certainly very entertaining. I've come to really appreciate "Temple Of Doom," which gets better with each viewing (especially the cinematography) and I always enjoy seeing Ford and Sean Connery together in "Last Crusade."</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>I'll try to make this short, as this site doesn't allow more than 300 words on the reviews.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK<br /><br />This film is the classic and quintessential "Indiana Jones" film. Great storyline, top-notch acting, rousing music (especially the famous<br />"Raiders March"), hair-raising action sequences and superb directing. Rated PG for action violence and mild language.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM<br /><br />The second (though chronologically the first) movie in the series is the darkest in the franchise. Good storyline, excellent acting, rousing music terrific drecting and some ideas originally conceived for "Raiders." Interesting sidenote: Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg married soon after this movie wrapped. Rated PG for some intense action violence.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE<br /><br />This third movie in the successful franchise is the lightest. The cast includes Bond villain Julian Glover, Bond girl Alison Doody, "Stand By Me" 's River Phoenix (as a young Indiana Jones in a prologue) and the original James Bond Sean Connery. Packed with action and comedy, this movie is one of the best. Rated PG for action violence and some language (in my opinion; the movie was unfairly smacked with a PG-13 rating).<br /><br />The extras are slightly disappointing. The production featurettes and documentaries are terrific, though shockingly brief. However, there are no deleted scenes. What a letdown. It would've been nice to see what was deleted from the film and to hear why the scenes were cut.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>In 1981, Steven Spielberg (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a>) and George Lucas (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope </a>) reinvented the pulp adventure genre that they had fallen in love with during their youth. Their film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was the perfect tribute to Saturday matinee serials and boys' adventure magazines. Not only did Spielberg and Lucas create the greatest action film in decades (and perhaps in the history of American movies), but they also introduced movie audiences to the greatest adventure hero since the days of Allan Quatermain, Tarzan, and Doc Savage. Harrison Ford, who lent his devil-may-care attitude to the globetrotting archaeologist, embodied Indiana Jones as no other actor could. Raiders of the Lost Ark became more than a blockbuster; it was the birth of an American icon and the first chapter in one of the greatest film franchises ever.<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark - 1981<br />Adventurer and archaeologist, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) searches for the fabled Lost Ark of the Covenant while being pursued by insidious Nazis and their vile henchmen. Along the way he reunites with his former lover, the feisty Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and confronts charming, treasure-hunting rival, Belloq (Paul Freeman). Indiana also encounters tarantulas, poisonous serpents, a deadly Arab swordsman, and a host of other perils and pitfalls, all of which he overcomes with a sly grin. But can even this daring heroic figure survive the lure and the power of the legendary Lost Ark?<br /><br />After the huge success, both commercial and critical, of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas set out to tell a second fantastic Indiana Jones story. However, this time they decided to use darker thematic material and in so doing caused some controversy. When Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released in 1984, it became immediately apparent that the film was darker and, in all likelihood, too violent and intense for children. The film utilized elements of pulp adventure stories, as had Raiders of the Lost Ark, but there was a greater emphasis on violence and horror. Many critics accused the film of being too extreme and even disturbing, and said that it lacked the spirit of fun that made the first film so accessible. Despite the negative reviews, no one could deny the film's commercial appeal or its originality.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom - 1984<br />After narrowly escaping from Asian gangsters, Indiana Jones, his young sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), and ditzy American singer Wilhelmina "Willie" Scott (Kate Capshaw) find themselves stranded in a small village in India. They soon take notice that there are no children in the village and they are told that the children were taken by a cult that worships the Goddess of Death, Kali. Indiana Jones finds connections between the story of the missing children and old legends of sacred stones that hold great power. He, Short Round, and Willie Scott go to Pankot Palace, where they discover that the cult has taken over the palace using a supernatural method of brainwashing, voodoo practices, ritualistic human sacrifice, and worse... they've enslaved the villagers' children. Can Indiana Jones find the sacred stones, stop the cult, and return the stolen children to their parents?<br /><br />In 1989, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas released their third Indiana Jones film. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a more light-hearted adventure with the welcome addition of Sean Connery as Indiana's father, Prof. Henry Jones. The film relied heavily on action and comedy, and was at times overly formulaic and reminiscent of the first Indiana Jones film. Despite some flaws in the script, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade became another mega-hit and provided the characters with a wonderful finale (which has since been rendered moot by the decision to make more Indy films) where they actually ride off into the sunset.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - 1989<br />After his father, Prof. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), goes missing during his search for the Holy Grail, Indiana Jones teams up with Elsa (Alison Doody), an Austrian researcher to find him. When Indiana Jones rescues Prof. Jones from the Nazis, he discovers that Elsa is a traitor and that the Nazis are close to uncovering the resting place of the Holy Grail, which has the power to give whoever drinks from it immortality. Can Indiana Jones and his father beat the Nazis in this epic race between good and evil?<br /><br />These three films form one of the most successful trilogies of all time, and it's no wonder that Indiana Jones is still in the public eye after all of these years. The three films feature an extraordinary cast including Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, Kate Capshaw, Ke Huy Quan, Amrish Puri, Sean Connery, Alison Doody, Julian Glover, and River Phoenix.<br />Besides the wonderful cast, one of the main reasons for the longevity of the Indiana Jones series are the action set pieces, which include some of the most memorable stunts ever captured on film. Who can forget the first time that they saw Indy skillfully swing across a chasm using his trusty bullwhip, or outrunning a giant boulder, or survive being in a room full of lethally venomous asps, or being chased by cult members in a mine cart, or cutting a bridge in half while he's still on it, or chasing an armored tank while on horseback? As you can see there's no limit to his adventures.<br />Since his debut, Indiana Jones has been emulated and imitated, but never duplicated. The quality of the writing, the direction, the acting, the production design, and the stunt work are unmatched by any other films within the genre. The series is also given an emotional resonance with the help of John William's brilliant theme music and scores. Though the series, much like Indiana Jones himself, has seen its share of ups and downs, it will undoubtedly go down in cinematic history as the greatest adventure films ever made.<br /><br />The Adventures of Indiana Jones- The Complete DVD Movie Collection contains Indy's first three classic films, which have been gloriously restored and remastered for maximum video and audio quality. Also included in this excellent 4-disc set are the following bonus materials: the comprehensive three-part documentary Making the Trilogy, The Stunts of Indiana Jones featurette, The Sound of Indiana Jones featurette, The Music of Indiana Jones featurette, The Light and magic of Indiana Jones featurette, theatrical trailers for all three films, and access to exclusive online features.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that the man in the hat will be around for many more years to come.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBLYA">The Tarzan Collection</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAW">King Kong</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RW5C2W">She</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JMS0">Jungle Jim</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">Casablanca</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXD5">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006B2A7E">King Solomon's Mines</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K40KY">Lawrence of Arabia</a></p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist adventurer, who spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasures--like the priceless long-lost Ark of the Covenant (the Hebrew sacred artifact that held the supposed Ten Commandments).

RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and the two subsequent sequels; INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE did massive box-office success and propelled star Harrison Ford to super-stardom in the 80s. Adored by fans, RAIDERS is perfect movie making. And while some purists claim that TEMPLE OF DOOM is the lesser of the trilogy, the action quota is higher than that of the excellent LAST CRUSADE. Together, these 3 movies have become some of the most famous and still greatest adventures in cinema history.<p>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is my all-time favorite movie. And one major reason is the incredible opening ten minutes. The ominous jungle setting, Spielberg's brilliant framing revealing the man in the hat. A mysterious cave with booby traps, shady guides who chicken out thus upping the impending threat, Indiana's swagger as he strides into the eerie cavern. Dangerous spiders, avoiding fatal spikes, carefully walking up to the antiquity, then it's grab and run as the cave begins to collapse, the hero betrayed by the shifty guide, dodging arrows, swinging over the chasm with whip, sliding under the quickly closing wall, the shifty guy is dead, and as he picks up the artifact an immense boulder starts thundering after the hero with ever-increasing pace, he swings out of the way cheating death by seconds... only to be faced by his arch nemesis, Belloq, and is forced to relinquish his precious find to the fiend. A tense moment, and suddenly twenty natives race after the hero, shooting arrows after him. Swinging on a vine to safety accompanied by John William's heroic score, he catches his plane. Cinema par excellence.<br />The success of RAIDERS is in the genius of it's design. No film since (Not even the sequels) has ever managed to pull off the idea of the whole film being one fantastic string of action sequences without being tedious or repetitive. The story is the best of the three movies, with Indy chasing after the lost ark of the covenant before the nazis get there. Here Spielberg shows why he is the best at what he does. And similar to another work of art in the Spielberg cannon; JAWS, John Williams is the 'fifth actor' in the film, with his brassy, heroic score underlying the action and continually giving momentum throughout the entire running time.<br />As all fans know, Spielberg originally wanted to direct a Bond movie. With Lucas' great writing and Spielberg steady hand, they not only blitzed the 007 movie of the same year, but ushered a whole new generation of film-makers, inspired and influenced to raise the bar in action movies.<p>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM follows the standard trilogy rule: the second movie is the darkest. Like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, the second adventure (Or third, since this is actually a prequel) sees Indiana in much darker territory. This time around, Indy's plane crashes in India, where he has to retrieve the stolen Shankara stones and save the children of the village. The action is the film's high point, especially the Shanghai action scene (Set in club Obi Wan) and the fantastic mine car chase. However, it does lose points with it's over-indulgence in dark horrors with human sacrifice and torture. Spielberg himself has said that when he watched it, he felt it was too violent. Compared with recent films, it seems somewhat tame, but still retains it power. But it is comic book violence after all, and therein lies the idea of the film. It's just a movie. But a very good one.<br />For the third installment, the dream team of Spielberg and Lucas came up with another inspired idea. With the casting of Bond vet Sean Connery as Indiana's father in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, a new layer of hitherto unseen emotion and clever humor makes this one a fantastic entry in the franchise. the action is great, and Indy's dad calling Indy 'Junior' never fails to be funny. This time, Junior is on the trail to find his father, who was kidnapped by the nazis in a plot to find the Holy Grail. Indy must rescue his dad and the race is on to find the artifact before it falls into the wrong hands. While there are less action set-pieces than in RAIDERS, when they do come, they are amazing. Thrilling boat chases, plane chases, the tank chase, and the finale, a fitting end to the most incredible trilogies of all time. No wonder there's still talk of Indy 4. I can hardly wait...</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>Before I begin, let me note there are THREE different Indiana Jones' sets. Two of them came out in 2003 (one was full-screen, the other widescreen). The one discussed in my review will be the newest one.<br /><br />All the films are in widescreen format and each come with a behind the scenes look at each film along with other extras too numerous to mention here.<br /><br />Now, for my opinions of each:<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK - Indiana Jones races to get the legendary Ark Of The Covenant from the hands of the Nazis. Along the way, he encounters an old flame from the past which is revisited in the fourth film "Kingdom Of The Krystal Skull."<br /><br />TEMPLE OF DOOM - After nearly escaping death from a chinese gang, Indiana Jones crash lands in India with singer Willie Scott and a little chinese kid named Short Round. Seeing the plight of these people, he agrees to help them save their children from slavery and recover their Shakara stone from an occult group.<br /><br />It should be fair to note that this film, while fun, is the darkest of the three that are out so far and some parts may not be suitable for kids.<br /><br />THE LAST CRUSADE - While trying to find his missing father (played by Sean Connery), Indiana Jones becomes involved in a chase for the cup of Christ. The very cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper before his crucifixion. Again, he goes against the Nazis in this two mission race.<br /><br />All three films are great thrill rides in my view! I am personally biased towards Temple Of Doom but all of them are great. I also think these film put Harrison Ford's name on the map, moreso than Star Wars did (only my opinion).<br /><br />Anyway, if you haven't bought the original box sets, then pick up the new one! Worth the buy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>This set of DVDs contains one of my all-time favorite movies and its two sequels.  On the merits of the original movie alone, this boxed set gets five stars.  The remainder is almost supplemental.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a classic adventure movie, an almost flawless film that introduces Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, archaeology professor and treasure hunter in the 1930s.  Recruited by the government to find the Ark of the Covenant (containing the remains of the Ten Commandments), Jones soon runs afoul of the others seeking the Ark, in particular the Nazis and his arch-nemesis, Belloq.  Belloq is actually the best villain in the entire series, an amoral archaelogist whose ambition seems to be to become Jones, so he is always seeking to emulate Indy's professional and romantic successes.<p>Temple of Doom -easily the weakest of the three - is supposedly a prequel to Raiders.  It is not so much action-packed as action-crammed, with so much fighting and fleeing that there is no real time for any real characters.  The villains are second-rate and the cute kid sidekick is annoying, but most grating is Kate Capshaw's character who is thoroughly unpleasant and pales in comparison to the much more interesting Marion Ravenwood in the first movie.  There are also contradictions created by this movie taking place earlier than Raiders:  how can Indy be so skeptical of the supernatural in Raiders if he has previously undergone the Temple of Doom adventures?<p>The Last Crusade returns to the spirit of the original movie, bringing back old characters and situations.  Although there is no Marion, we do have Sean Connery as Indiana Jones's father.  The two of them are racing against the Nazis to find the Holy Grail.  If not quite as good as the original, it is still a decent movie.<p>This is not so much a trilogy as a series, the distinction being that a trilogy is essentially one long story (like Star Wars or the Matrix) and a series is a sequence of individual stories focused on the same characters (like James Bond or the Lethal Weapon movies).  As a series, each movie must be judged on it own merits, and as such, this is a set of one great, one good and one so-so movie.  The supplemental materials are interesting, but if you skip them, you aren't missing a whole lot.  Buy this set for Raiders (which you can't get by itself), and maybe The Last Crusade.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>This is what you have been waiting for if you are a Harrison Ford fan.

I'm sure anyone who grew up watching Indiana Jones and his amazing adventures will always remember them fondly from his time of finding the ark to seeking the holy grail.  The best part of getting this set is seeing how all the special effects were done back then before we became to accustomed to all the CGI special effects we see in todays movies.  To all those who grew up in the late 70's and early 80's we probably remember when instead of using computers to create a town,building,or scenic environment the film crew would have to make the set themselves for the most part.  I'm not trying to discredit the advances we've gotten with cgi effects but it feels we've become so dependent on them in our movies from creating as I said environmental scenes to computer generated car chases.  I'm sorry I rambled on a little all I'm trying to say is if you're looking for a great adventure series set without the hassle of to much cgi input this would be one of the great ones to get...</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>Well, my reviews of the last two Indy movies still stand, but I STILL don't like "Raiders of the Lost Ark", now retitled "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark". Whoopee. Besides James Bond, Indy has to be the most imitated movie hero since Tarzan, but I can assure you, "Raiders" is NOT the movie that spurred the land office business in fedoras, short leather jackets and that spate of Indy-type TV shows in the mid-eighties...it was probably "Temple of Doom" that set it off. "Raiders" is still, to me, empty, stupid, cliched and tailor made for a non-discriminating mass audience, like Spielberg's other movies of that era. I don't know....I always liked the movies he's PRODUCED, directed by others, more than his own movies....HIS movies are like that old joke about Chinese food...you're always a hungry ten minutes later, like they're missing something....big time! "E.T.", "Close Encounters", "Raiders" and "Jurassic Park" have always struck me that way, and "Bruce" in "Jaws" always looked SOOOOOO fake, (and the movie wasn't the LEAST bit scary, either!) I've always felt burned after seeing a Spielberg movie! This is why I say it's obvious that Lucas and possibly Kauffman have both had substantially extensive involvement in the latter two movies, which were much more enjoyable than the first.<br /><br />It's not easy being a completist, lemme tell ya! ;-)</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>This four disc set contains three classic action movies and one disc loaded with bonus material.<br /><br />Up first is "Raiders of the Lost Ark."  In it, we meet our hero, archeology professor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford).  Indiana isn't just a classroom professor.  When the right opportunity presents itself, he heads out to the field in search of some priceless artifact.  This particular time, he's searching for the Jewish Ark of the Covenant.  But he's not the only one on the trail.  He has to race the Nazi's around the world to uncover its hiding place.<br /><br />Next is "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."  Set a couple years before the first movie, Indiana gets stranded in India when an attempt to sell his latest find goes bad.  The only way the locals will give him directions out of there is if he retrieves their sacred rock from a nearby temple where a cult uses it in some horrid practices.<br /><br />Finally comes "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."  When Indiana's father (Sean Connery) goes missing, it's up to Indiana to find him and the Holy Grail before the Nazis do.<br /><br />All three of these movies are fun.  They are filled with lots of action, yet the story holds together.  "Raiders" is easily the best of the series.  Everything was fresh and new here.  "Temple of Doom" is the weakest of the lot.  It is darker in tone and the story wanders a bit more.  Things definitely improve with "Last Crusade."  Sean Connery is funny as Indy's dad, and that dynamic makes it seem fresh again.<br /><br />For years, this set has been the only way to get the classic trilogy on DVD.  And that's not a bad thing.  Each movie gets its own disc.  The set came in both widescreen and full frame editions.  I have the widescreen, and the picture looks great.  The sound is wonderful as well.  All the extras are on the fourth disc.  And all the features are new.  The highlight is the two hour documentary on the making of the trilogy.  There's plenty of behind the scenes information here.  There are also four featurettes that focus more on the music, special effects, stunts, and sound effects.<br /><br />These movies are pure fun, and that's all they were trying to be.  So if you are looking for a good time at the movies, look up Indiana.  And if you are a fan, you'll be quite satisfied with this set.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones is a character that is timeless. He makes treasure hunting look soooo easy! His vast knowledge keeps him one step ahead of the bad guys or curses (which ever one is in the way) and he always gets the girl even if he doesn't want her!<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark - Keeps you hopping through the jungle to the desert with lots of action along the way.<br /><br />Temple of Doom - Gives new meaning to sacrifices and just who gets to be the sacrifice!<br /><br />Last Crusade- Brings Sean Connery in as dad and there is no better combination of father and son. The camaraderie between these two will keep you in stitches and the action gives you plenty of excitement.<br /><br />There are a few intense scenes and language so I can't recommend this set for all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>My boyfriend originally bought this about two years ago, for both of us to watch. We're still together, but it's taken him this amount of time to persuade me to watch it. It's become a running joke, including one of his lovely (male) colleagues nearly inviting himself round to watch this and have a few beers. Hopefully now it will stop - and I'll watch the rest. Yes, I did actually enjoy it that much. OK, I'm only rating it 3 stars, but I've only seen the first movie (which is actually the second movie, but chronologically the first - try getting your head around THAT!), and will hopefully see the sequel & the prequel at a later date, and add to this review.<br /><br />I've often heard this (or these) movies compared mostly to the Lara Croft & The Mummy movies. OK, I can see a slight similarity, since they're supposedly both about archeology, but I didn't really see that much about it in this! I did see a similarity that my boyfriend pointed out to Young Sherlock Holmes. Harrison is now more known for his relationship with that Ally McBeal girl, and there's been rumours about a fourth movie for ages. I'd have to see the other movies first before I comment on a possible fourth, but I think he's slightly on the wrong side of 50 to do these now. We'll see.<br /><br />When this film opened with a severely corny song & dance routine (coming from a girl who loves Grease & Sound Of Music, that's saying something!) I decided giving in to my boyfriend just this once was a bad idea. Thankfully it picked up, although I did find the film slightly slow at points. Kate Capshaw was OK I guess, although I read that she had to be taught how to be scream. How do you get 'taught' how to scream? I thought it would be natural instinct! I loved little Jonathan Ke Quan, as Short Round. This kid was absolutely adorable, although you had to listen really closely to what he said, but whatever he was saying had me smiling! He hasn't done that much since this, apart from The Goonies, and seems to be working behind the camera much more now. Look up some recent photos of him though - what a cutie!<br /><br />I think Harrison does have a pretty fair chance of returning to playing Indy, as he's more affectionately known. He hasn't changed that much from then & now. OK his hair's gone white, but obviously, if there is going to be a fourth, it's going to be brought very up to date.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised at how little this film has dated, considering it's the same age as me. OK there was a couple of dodgy scenes, particularly the scene where they snowboard in a dinghy, but that was all I noticed really.<br /><br />I will be very interested to see the rest of the movies, and hopefully give my boyfriend a chance to review a DVD he's had for two years. I'll add to this review the more I see. Can't wait!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>One of the most exciting movies that I ever saw was "Raiders of the Lost Ark".  From the very first moment to the very last, this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The movie was intended to mimic the old serials of the 1940's that used to show Saturday mornings at the theaters.  Each episode would end with the hero about to fall off a cliff, get eaten by an aligator, get run over by a train, or some such disaster.  The kids would be sure to come back next week to see what happened and then get left with another cliffhanger.  The only problem with these serials were that they were usually put together on a shoestring.  Generally, only juvenile boys enjoyed them.  However, what if a major film studio backed such a project with a tons of money, a top Hollywood star, a big-name director, and excellent writers.  Well, we'd get "Raiders of the Lost Ark".  (You'll note that the enemy again was the Nazi's; just like in a lot of those old serials).<br /><br />The second movie in the trio, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", was a bit of a disappointment but only because it didn't live up to the original movie.  If someone saw this movie first, "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" next, and finished with "Raiders of the Lost Ark", they'd probably be amazed how everything started out strong and just got better.  There are a number of good scenes in "Temple of Doom" and I guess we can't realistically complain about the supernatural nature of the bad guys; there's plenty of supernatural stuff in the other two movies as well.  However, the source of the supernatural and the nature of the bad guys are generally easier for most of the audience to relate to in Jones I & III.<br /><br />Yes, the Nazis are back in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and they're just as mean and determined as before.  This time Indiana has his dad along (played by Sean Connery).  They go in search of the Holy Grail and it's amazing what they find.  There are a lot of thrills and spills in this movie as well.<br /><br />I think that there was probably a real wish by the general public to see some more of Indiana Jones after "The Last Crusade" but it hasn't happened and I think Harrison Ford is a bit past his prime to try and recreate the role.  There was a TV program that appeared and, thank goodness, disappeared quickly that portrayed Indiana Jones as a boy.  I don't think George Lucas plans on doing another trilogy ala "Star Wars" but who knows?<br /><br />Those old 1940's serials are mostly lost for good.  The ones that might still be available probably wouldn't be worth the time to watch them. With this set, even your great great grandchildren should be able to enjoy them as much as you did; no matter how old you were when you first saw them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Watching Raiders presented in the new box set on big screen HDTV brought back all the excitement of seeing it the first time.  Harrison Ford in his signature role, building on the cavalier tough/nice guy Han Solo routine, makes the film what it is.  Sweeping in scope, Indy journeys across continents as a little red line on maps to fight the Nazis prior to WWII.  Their mutual goal, the discovery of the lost ark of the covenant, containing the 10 commandment tablets.  The fight and chase scenes are marvelously staged; doing without the sterile CG accompaniment of today's movies.  The soundtrack is complimentarily epic and unforgettable, as are the sometimes brutal action sequences that Lucas and Spielberg would mellow considerably in following films.  This film redefined the action/adventure genre with its humour, action, acting, and location shots.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>The first Indiana Jones will always be my favorite. I was at an adventurous stage of my life when it came out, and the boulder rolling down toward him in the first scene only wet my appetite to go on Safari or tromp through a jungle for myself! The sequels are good too, and I like the interaction between Indiana and his father in the later movies. Their relationship adds more depth to the characters. And of course, a good love interest can always bring new twists to an adventure story.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>There are certain films that all lovers of movies should have on their must own collection.  Obvious choices might include THE GODFATHER, GONE WITH THE WIND, CITIZEN KANE, etc.  But RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (and its sequels to a lesser extent) should be there as a classic example of a classic adventure movie.  <p>And it is a great movie!  A joy to watch, even after all these years.  Harrison Ford is charming and an action hero for the ages.  Karen Allen is properly spunky.  The stunts are NOT aided by computer enhancement, and that gives them a visceral feel that all the &quot;stunts&quot; generated by computer for MATRIX RELOADED can't match.<p>TEMPLE OF DOOM and LAST CRUSADE are certainly lesser movies, but that's only because if RAIDERS is a 98 on a scale of 100, the others are maybe 85 &amp; 90. Still pretty darn good!<p>The DVD's are a treat.  The sound remix is FANTASTIC!  I have surround sound at home, and rarely has it been used to such great affect.  The explosions shook the walls!!  <p>True to Spielberg's form, there is NO commentary from him, which is always kinda a shame, but other than that, the extras are pretty good.  Remember, nowadays they make movies with DVD's IN MIND, so there are always cameras capturing everything, extra scenes filmed JUST so they can market the DVD later as having &quot;deleted scenes&quot; and so on.  INDIANA's movies were made in another time, so the extras may feel a bit sketchy.  What the heck...you don't but these movies for the blooper reel...you buy them to remember what good, clean, FUN adventure is all about.<p>ENJOY!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>It's about time that this series came out on DVD and after watching Raider's of the Lost Ark, I'm glad they waited.  I bought the DVD and couldn't wait to get it home so that I could watch it.  I turned off the lights, popped some popcorn and sat down to watch it.  Besides getting greeted with a pristine picture, the sound was amazing.  The arrows and stuff at the beginning of the movie came out from all directions and it felt like I was 12 again and watching the movie for the first time.  It's a shame that this wasn't done sooner, but I can kind of understand why.<p>Now if Mr. Lucas would release his other trilogy on DVD, I will be very happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Yup, here it is!  If you're like me, you've been waiting for these since the day you bought a dvd player.  Well, now you can get em!  The price is right and the films are tight(you like that? I just made that up).  I won't go into the plot details, coz you'd have to be a schmuck if you haven't seen these films about 800 times throughout your life.  But I will say that this trilogy is the very definition of Action-Adventure, and Indiana Jones is the definition of Action hero-tied only with James Bond.  I don't think any action film since has surpassed these.  These were made in the glorious days of action-the 80s.  Back when a PG rated film could show people's faces melting, or have a bald nazi hacked up into hamburger helper by an airplane propeller.  In fact, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is probably the most violent PG rated film ever.  Temple Of Doom says PG on the dvd case now, as opposed to it's original PG-13 rating, but that was probably a mistake.  It's still the same film-heart ripping, bug eating, child whipping and all!  The dvds are featureless, but that's what the fourth disc is for.  Basically, it's the features from all films put on one disc.  Not a bad idea.  So, I'd suggest slapping yourself a few times if you haven't got it already, then run out and get it, pronto!</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Steven Speilberg, George Lucas, &amp; Harrison Ford scored big with this one, Dr. Jones (Ford) is an archeologist who's quest for rare antiques usually get him in all kinds of mishaps, his search for a rare Idol is neat at the beginning, after he acquires it through death-defying stunts, it is taken from him by a rival archeologist, the film then progresses to its plot where Jones is contacted by government agents who have learned that the Ark Of The Convenant (keeper of the Ten Commandments) may have been discovered, the film is set in 1936 at a time when Hitler is seeking world domination &amp; believes the Ark can help him acquire it, fearing Hitler's pursuit they hire Jones to go after it &amp; get it before the Nazis do, what follows is one cliffhanger after another, when Jones meets up with his old flame &amp; takes her on the journey with him,they are attacked by anyone &amp; everyone, Jones soon discovers that his rival is working for Hitler, but has a plan all his own in acquiring the Ark's magic, Jones acquires it first only to have it taken, the action is non-stop as Jones tries to take it back, he is soon captured along with Marion(his old flame), what follows the last ten minutes is the magic of ILM, Belloq(Jones rival) attempts to open the Ark before delivering it to Hitler, when he does it is his &amp; Hitler's stooges' undoing, the message is clear ( don't mess with the almighty!!!!!!) only Jones &amp; Marion are spared &amp; the Ark delivered to the U.S. for safe-keeping in what might be considered Area 51, one of the best films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X7FS1H4R02W1.html">A1X7FS1H4R02W1</a><br/><p>Your in for the wildest ride with these four DVDs.

Not only is the action better, but there was more special effects. To me this darker second film, is the best of the triogy. Just like the "Empire Strikes Back" of the "Star Wars" saga. I suggest you go  and watch the second film "The Temple of Doom", and you will see that this film has more thrills,chills,laughs, and action then the other two installments.<br /><br />The Last Crusade -<br /><br />Harrison Ford and Sean Connery form an excellent team in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

Unfortunately, Steven Spielberg nixed the idea of including such things as deleted scenes on this set, and despite requests from producer and pal George Lucas, he also elected not to record audio commentary. So what does that leave extras-wise? Well... you get a documentary, four featurettes, trailers for all three films and a DVD-ROM weblink. That's disappointing at first.

The Ark of the Covenant reigns as a frightening artifact,  one even the Agnostic Jones is forced to respect.<br /><br />Small touches of humor are also well done ... "Asps. Very dangerous. You go first!"<br /><br />The Temple of Doom is a less intriguing story, and more outlandish... but it's a manic and entertaining ride. Again, the humor will make you laugh out loud...  although it is a bit insulting to woman (the Kate Capshaw character).<br /><br />The Last Crusade is also well crafted, and Sean Connery plays a terrific senior Jones. The Father and Son dynamic is the best feature of this film!<br /><br />The enigmatic feats needed to reach the inner sanctum of the "Petra" fortress... where the Grail is hidden... are ingenious. The centuries old Crusader knight does stretch believability beyond the norm, however.<br /><br />These are tremendous films.

Now I can't get that damned John Williams music out of my head.<br /><br />It's amazing how the plots don't make any sense whatsoever. I totally missed that as a child, which probably explains why the Harvard scholarship eluded me. Actually, not only are they completely nonsensical, but actually the plot jumps wouldn't be tolerated in a movie today. Cases in point:<br /><br />1. How in the hell did a former girlfriend have the bronze amulet that gains access to the Ark? (And she was wearing that around her neck.)<br />2. How did the Nazis follow Jones or find her 5 minutes after he arrived?<br />3. Indy only helps the Nazis to find the Ark more quickly, and then the Ark kills them all anyway (this problem was repeated in the first Tomb Raider, weirdly enough).<br /><br />... and it goes on and on. You could write hundreds of these.<br /><br />The screenwriting process here is like two caffeine-fueled comic book fans in competition to produce the most outrageous 'and-then' moment:<br /><br />#1: "Now he gets shot in the arm by a Nazi!"<br />#2: "Yeah but now he gets punched out of the windshield of the car!"<br />#1: "BUT he crawls under the moving car and climbs up the other side!"<br />#2: "And then THE NAZI gets thrown out of the windshield!"<br />#1: "BUT only out of the side that's not already broken!"<br />#2: "Yeah but HE gets run over the truck he was driving!"<br />#1: "GREAT! More double-whip no-chai extra-shot latte?"<br />#2: "Sure. Have we mentioned any aliens yet?"<br /><br />But who cares because they're fun movies and Jones is such a good screen character that it's a joy to watch all the BS. I mean, compare these to The Mummy movies, and it's obvious which series people will watch in 10, 20, 30 years time.<br /><br />Doom is the weakest of the three - uncharacteristically dark and sadistic - with the story only kicking off after the midpoint of the film. The sidekick and romantic interests are annoying, and they don't have the 'Champagne bad guy', so the main villain seems very flat. The Last Crusade is clearly when everyone got comfortable with the formula, and is the most expertly made in terms of balance of action scenes, humor and mild drama.<br /><br />Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by how much sheer fun I had rewatching the set after 15 years - I'm looking forward to #4. It's actually great to see films without CGI in every damned scene... it reminds me of why hanging off a bridge seems like a dangerous idea.<br /><br />PS - The extras are so-so. Don't buy this set if you've already got the films since the 10-15 mins of extras on each disc are disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>The Adventures of Indiana Jones DVD Box Set includes all three films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade.

How about Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr.?<p>In a return to the early serials of their childhood, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg invented an archeologist/adventurer by the name of Jones. Originally to be played by Tom Selleck, Harrision Ford stepped in when Selleck couldn't get out of doing a TV series (Magnum, PI). Each man ended up with a signature role to call their own.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark - Where the adventure all began. Ford, along with Karen Allen, try to stop the Nazi regime from finding the Lost Ark of the Covenent. A roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Perhaps the best of the three.<p>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom - A prequel which sees Indy team up with a kid and Mrs. Spielberg on another quasi-religious quest. While darker and less satisfyiong than the first, still an excellent film.<p>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - It's Indy against the Nazi horde once again. This time, our hero sets out to save his father (Sean Connery), and find the Holy Grail, literally. They played up the comic elements more in this one, but it was better received than the second installment.<p>All in all, this is one of the best trilogies in movie history.

They are acting as though George Lucas is the only man guilty of double dipping.  But I turn around and there is the 9th edition of Independence Day, the 5th edition of the Rambo movies (Soon to be 6th)  The many times Terminator 2 has been re-issued on DVD, and don't get me started on the Evil Dead movies.  The Star Wars movies are distributed on DVD by 20th Century Fox, the same studio which, less than a year after the initial release, cranked out a special edition of The Day After Tomorrow, and which annually re-issues not just Day After Tomorrow and Independence dDay, but Speed, the Die Hard movies, the Abyss, The Sound of Music, and the Alien movies on an annual basis, every year with new cover art, and sometimes with bonus features, sometimes without.  The Indiana Jones movies are distributed by Paramount, which has released at least 2 editions of each of the Star Trek movies, and I am certain that when the new Star Trek movie gets released, we can anticipate a 3rd release of those features, either when Star Trek XI is released theatrically or on DVD.  This summer there is going to be a new 2 disk edition of Batman Begins getting released (I wonder if it will be the same as the old 2 disk edition of Batman Begins) in order to capitalize on the release of The Dark Knight.  This isn't really a marketing ploy by Lucas so much as standard marketing procedure on the part of the studios.  So, everyone who gave this a 1 star for being a re-release, quick, get to the new edition of Batman Begins and give that a 1 star review as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>The most frustrating thing about Steven Spielberg is that he embodies a contradiction:  he has the skill of a great auteur but the taste of a populist hack.  When he applies his skills to "serious" films, the results are usually mixed, with potentially great material undermined by huge doses of pure sentiment.  It is as though, after inviting us to a delightful gourmet meal, he cannot resist the urge to serve corndogs and ketchup on the side, simply because he likes them.  There they sit on the fine china - reflecting in the Waterford crystal and perfectly placed silver utensils.  It's not that there's anything wrong with corndogs, per se - they just seem so out of place.<br /><br />Happily, for every Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List (almost a great film), and Amistad, there are several more Spielberg films like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and even A.I. (which, while dark, mostly avoids the usual slop of calculated "hankie moments").<p>Then there are gems like two of the three Indiana Jones movies.  The outer films of the trilogy sparkle.  They are finely honed entertainment machines that do not disappoint.  Classy, slick, fun, and elegant, they are the best damned corndogs money can buy.  They have everything to which great popular cinema aspires: adventure, romance, action, crisp dialog, and engaging characters.  The father/son dynamic of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in The Last Crusade is perfection.  It is, perhaps, the best of the three, combining the usual thrills, chills, stunts, and outlandish set-pieces with a subtextual spiritual journey that actually works.  It catches us off-guard - by treating that hoary old trope of the search for the Holy Grail as an excuse for high adventure, it unexpectedly manages to sneak in some spiritual redemption in its last few minutes.  It doesn't seem artificial or forced, either.  Given that you buy into the mythology of the film, Indiana Jones' tests of faith as he seeks to save his father's life ring perfectly true.  I dare you not to hold your breath as he steps into the abyss on his way into the grail chamber, and ponder, if briefly, whether you would have the faith and courage to do the same.  In my more devout days, I even used the three challenges Indie faces to illustrate a Sunday School lesson.<p>While I have since retreated from Devout to Doubtful (or at least, agnostic), I still get a little chill running up my spine when no less than the Wrath of God is unleashed at the end of the first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It's great stuff, too - a kind of reckless, swaggering serial-cum-action epic that never misses a step as it dances, Gene Kelley-like, through one insanely improbable situation after another.  The Nazis want the Ark of the Covenant, for its symbolic, and perhaps actual, power.  Indiana Jones wants it for his university's museum.  Will he get it before they do?  Will he escape from the escalating series of traps?  Will he rescue the girl?  Of course he will.  We know that from the first scene.  But watching how he does it all is where the fun lies. <p>The middle film of the trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, is another story.  The humor seems tinny and forced, at ruinous odds with the almost sadistically dark story of missing children forced into slave labor, and evil rituals where priests pull beating hearts out of human sacrifices before lowering them into pits of lava.  Such material would be perfectly acceptable in a certain kind of film, but clangs disastrously against the lighter tone set by its predecessor.  It's as though Clive Barker hijacked the production about a third of the way into the shoot, then gave it back to Spielberg for the last few scenes.  Kate Capshaw is stuck with the thankless task of playing a thoroughly unlikeable golddigger who somehow wins Indie's heart.  I actually found that part less believable than the whole human sacrifice schtick.<p>This DVD set is handsomely produced, with a fat selection of bonus material on the fourth disk.  It's worth the price, with the THX treatment polishing all the films to a high gloss.  As the wisdom of Meatloaf has it, in the gospel of Bat Out of Hell, "...two out of three ain't bad'."</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>i doubt this trilogy needs to be summerized.im pretty sure everyone and their cousins has seen these.the first 2 parts were spectacular,then comes the mockery part 3.and whats this spliting up full frame/wide screen versions?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?gollywood strikes again.in closing,the 1st 2 were spectacular,the 3rd was amazingly forgettable.how long before giftbox set special version with never befores?!?!?!?!?!?</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>WITH THE ACTOR HARRISSON FORD A MANY OTHERS WITH STEVEN SPIELBERG AS MASTER OF CINEMATOGRAPHY THE BETTER WAS ATTAINED FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS AND THE LAST MOVIE CONTAIN MISTER SEAN CONNERY (THE FATHER OF INDIANA JONES) VERY MUCH GOOD IS NOT ENOUGHT ..... !!!!! ******** SPLENDID ******** IS FURTHER CORRECT ....</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>The 81 film is a build-up and the 1989-film showcases River Phoenix and Sean Connery to great advantage(River even performed his owns stunts...)<br /><br />But the best is "The Temple of Doom"...It borrows its premises from old  cheap serials, but here it is given an all-stops-out production treatment and a great performance from the future Mrs Spielberg, Kate Capshaw.

The eyeball-rolling sequels, on the other hand, were strictly for the kiddies and the ubiquitous fast-food marketing tie-ins. For fans of the sequels (and obsessive completists), box sets are a nice option, I suppose, but the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; DVD trilogy now joins the available-as-box-set-only &quot;Godfather&quot; collection (and the upcoming &quot;Star Wars&quot; DVD extravaganza) as a cynical slap in the face to those of us who prefer the &quot;a-la-carte&quot; option (and a little money left over for,oh, you know- rent and food). Boo! Hiss! to corporate greed and this extremely irritating industry trend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>One of the greatest action/adventure franchises of all time, the original "Indiana Jones" trilogy returns to DVD in an excellent three-disc collector's set! Chances are, if you own the original four-disc set, you won't be purchasing this collection. But if this is your first time buying it, then the wait is definitely worth it! All three films come together with terrific picture and sound, and come with great extras that are sure to entertain!<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981)<br />The film that started it all, "Raiders" is a fantastic adventure film that brings back the excitement of the 1930's movie serials! Featuring terrific acting from Harrison Ford and a stellar ensemble cast, thrilling action sequences and visual effects, and another memorable score by John Williams, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg crafted a fantastic film full of awe, wonder and excitement, cementing Indiana Jones as one of the greatest adventure heroes of all time!<br />Movie Grade: A<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984)<br />As he had done with the second installment of the "Star Wars" trilogy, Lucas wanted to create a darker, edgier film for the second installment of the "Indiana Jones" trilogy. But what worked for "Star Wars" does not work for Indy and the gang. While the film features some terrific action sequences, a great friendship story between Indy and his sidekick, Short Round, and another fantastic score from John Williams, the film goes to far into the macabre, featuring gruesome images (a man with his heart ripped out, then bursting into flames; men getting ripped apart by crocodiles) and humor (A gross dinner scene) that was unnecessary for an "Indy" film, and gave birth to the PG-13 rating. Still, the film features some good moments, making it a worthwhile film, though it is still the weakest of the first three films.<br />Movie Grade: B<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989)<br />The best of the sequels to "Raiders" (And my personal favorite of the "Indy" adventures), "The Last Crusade" is a fantastic film that returns Indy to fighting Nazis in search of religious icons. What makes this film great are the terrific action sequences, some great spiritual references, and fantastic chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sir Sean Connery. These elements come together to create a fantastic adventure epic that redeems the franchise, and is both exciting and moving at the same time. Terrific entertainment!<br />Movie Grade: A+<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />"Indiana Jones: The Adventure Collection" is a terrific set for those who don't own the films already, and helps to get us all ready when "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" comes out on May 22. This set is highly recommended!<br />DVD Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>I won't beat around the bush, these films are classics and I cannot praise them enough. It's no exaggeration in the slightest bit to say that this series not only made archaeology fun, interesting and sexy for the masses but it more than likely also inspired hundreds of men and women across the globe to become archaeologists! That's the power of truly great cinema!<br /><br />Personally, I'm convinced Temple of Doom was the best in the series with Raiders falling incredibly close behind. I've probably watched TOD fifty times and it never seems to get old. Concerning The Last Crusade, well, I don't want to get too negative but I thought it was an irritating entry. Whichever entry you love or hate, this collection is perfect for fans! You get the special editions of each film plus extras! Fantastic!<br /><br />What can I say? These are freakin' awesome and this set is worth every penny! There's only one small problem, one small reason why I wouldn't recommend purchasing this, and that is the fourth film. The fourth film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, there's a great chance you'll be seeing ANOTHER Indiana Jones box set released with all the releases of this set plus the new film. I mean, why bother purchasing this for about $30 and get 3 films when you get wait another 8 months and purchase all 4 films for $50? If you can't wait, grab this anyhow.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Is everyone ready for the mid-May 2008 release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Well, you're certainly not ready if you (or your kids) havent seen the first three Indiana Jones movies in the series. And this collection will do the trick perfectly.<br /><br />Okay...okay. I'm like 99% sure that it isn't absolutely necessary to see the first three movies in the series in order to fully enjoy the May 2008 release of Crystal Skull. But it will certain give you some history prior to jumping in to a 4th in a series, and it certainly won't be time wasted as they are excellent films.<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark was stunning for its time (1981). No surprise with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg at the helm. Raiders holds up as one of the best action movies to date. Indiana Jones searches for and tries to protect a powerful relic from getting into the wrong hands. Viewers get thoroughly entertained with a fast moving, suspenseful and thrilling ride.<br /><br />In Temple of Doom (1984) Indy inadvertantly finds himself thrust into village overrun by an evil cult that commit human sacrifice and child slavery. Ironically, while the themes in Temple are much darker than its predessor, Spielberg actually 'dumbed it down' a bit (with some over the top slapstick and other silliness) in order to keep the film attractive to wider audiences and also to attain the first ever PG-13 rating (instead of an R).<br /><br />The Last Crusade (1989) brings in the great Sean Connery as Indy's dad, and together they fullfil a lifelong dream (more the Dad's dream than Indy's) of finding The Holy Grail. Strangely, Last Crusade got hit with a PG-13, but it was much lighter than Temple of Doom, and it went back to a more Lost Ark kind of action film.<br /><br />Overall, it was fun breaking out this collection (that I actually purchased here at Amazon 2004) and re-watching the movies with my kids. We're now all really psyched for 2008's Crystal Skull.<br /><br />For what it's worth, there is another collection coming out in May 2008 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE">Indiana Jones - The Adventure Collection</a>. But from what I hear the only difference is in the bonus stuff. The item on this page already has a whole disk of bonus stuff...and the item on this page is available now.</p></br></body></html>

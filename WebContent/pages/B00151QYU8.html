The movie that Christians especially Catholics dislike.  I wanted to know what the big hub-bub was all about and  so, I watched the movie.  Either you love it or hate it, I watched it as a  comedy and not as preaching to what I should do religiously and I found it  very entertaining.<p>Of the Kevin Smith movies, I like this one a lot.  My  brother puts this at the lowest of Kevin Smith movies and he dislikes it  because it focuses too much on religion.  I look at it as something to  laugh about and to see another perspective or another person's storyline  and you either are entertained or not.  So, I don't hold grudges and I  don't feel like banning the movie.  I don't place this movie up to  blasphemy with &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; but if you can  just separate yourself from your religious side for 128 minutes, give this  movie a try and if you like it..you like it and if you dislike it...you  dislike it.<p>I bought this movie hearing that a special collector's  edition will be out sometime this year.  All Kevin Smith movies are  collector's edition except this.  You don't get hardly anything.  Just a  trailer and talent files.  So, in the extra department, this movie blows.  The audio of the movie is driven by dialogue, so don't expect any major  surround sound.  There are certain scenes where they are utilized but just  a little.  The video is pretty cool too, then again, I wasn't really  watching for artifacts during this movie.  A few reviews mentioned they saw  compression artifacts...<p>It amazes me how Smith got talented people to  work on this $10 million movie, when these actors are making humongous  amount of money.  This movie features an all-star cast including the guest  cameos in the movie.  <p>With all three previous Kevin Smith movies, fans  were treated with cool extras.  Yes, rumor has it that a special edition  will be coming out at the end of the year but still....<p>Overall this  movie is pretty fun to watch, the lack of features drives the overall score  down but give it a try, you might enjoy it. <p>Movie gets 5 stars, Special  Features (or lack of)gets 0 stars which drives the overall DVD down to 3  stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>I thought Dogma was one of Kevin Smith's best as a movie and as a comedy because of how it took a jab at religion and the church and how even if God saw this movie, he'd laugh because let's say it everyone has a sense of humor.<p>It stars an All Star cast of Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Selma Hayek, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jeanine Garafalo, Kevin Smith himself, Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, George Carlin and Alanis Morrisette. You would think that usually, when you have that many stars, the movie isn't the same because each actor/actress is trying to steal each other's thunder, but not hear because all of them have really brought together their collective skills and made Dogma a wonderful and hilarious masterpiece.<p>It starts as Affleck and Damon, 2 exiled Angels from Heaven and follows them on their killing spree before they cleanse their souls by walking through the doors of a church celebrating it's Bicentennial. By them doing this, they find a hole in God's creation and by proving God wrong, all that ever existed would cease to be. It's up to Fiorentino, Smith, Mewes, Rock and Hayek to stop them no matter what!<p>O.k. Dogma might make a few people made because it pokes fun at religion. I have to admit it, you'd probably be more offended by the vulgar swearing before that because when it all comes down to it's just a movie and there have been comedies that have made fun of very serious things. And even so, this movie never once said that religion is bad. Again, it just pokes a little fun at it.<p>I would definitely get this one. Even if you're not a Kevin Smith fan, you'll still laugh at this one. And again for any of you that are very religious, you'd probably be more offended by the swearing first. Check this one out!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Even though there is a disclaimer at the beginning of this film, I didn't find the film as offensive as I thought I would. As a matter of fact, I didn't find it offensive at all. This is entire film is in good humor and there are many laughs to be had in this movie! Jay and Silent Bob make the film when they are on, but there are many other characters just as funny.<br /><br />Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alank Rickman, Chris Rock, Jason Lee and all of the others come through and make the characters they play really come to life and be believable. Ben and Matt are great as the two angels killing those they say are sinners to bring the fear of God back into peoples lives. Alan is great as the angel who isn't allowed to drink, even though he isn't on that much, he's really cool. Everyone is great! Overall, this movie is really worth seeing if you are a fan of Kevin Smith.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>Some of these reviewers have panned this movie as a misuse of great acting talent.  Fans of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, particularly, assert that their boys were underserved by this film.<br /><br />If you've never seen this movie before, here's a suggestion.  Look at it as sort of a senior thesis in filmmaking.  It's chock-full of original, quirky ideas, many of which are calculated to get people mad.  This is the concept meant by the word "sophomoric."<br /><br />Two angels that have lost favor find a technical loophole with dogma which will allow them back into heaven.  So, it's a "quest" movie where the questors are fallen angels, and their quest lacks legitimacy.  As written, the angels have become imps in the classical sense:  they have a mean-spirited, mischievous sense of humor.<br /><br />People object to many things here, but perhaps one of the things that most sticks in the throat is that Jay and Silent Bob, two characters that define the terms "slacker" and "low-life," end up becoming the instrumentalities that God uses to restore balance to the universe.  But that notion has plenty of precedent in the New Testament anyway.  Read it some time...<br /><br />Anyway, taken as a senior thesis, this is actually a satisfying movie.  As a catalyst for talking about the traditions of the Catholic Church, even, it serves a halfway decent purpose.<br /><br />And, if you're looking for a more suitable vehicle for Ben Affleck, try "Pearl Harbor."</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>There are very, very many really good things in this movie, but in the end it is marred by an inability to pull all the elements together as well as by a really weak ending.  Oh, and another weak link:  the depiction of God.<p>God doesn't fare well in cinema history.  Nothing is harder in a movie than to represent God in compelling fashion.  Alanis Morrissette's cart wheeling Yahweh is easily one of the least convincing.  Even worse than Will Smith's turn as Bagger Vance AKA Jesus in another movie featuring Matt Damon.  Or George Burns in his incarnation as the I WHO I AM in a couple of dreadful films with John Denver.  In fact, I can think of only one truly moving portrayal of God in film:  Rex Ingram's &quot;De Lawd&quot; in GREEN PASTURES.<p>This is a film of ideas, and if you don't like ideas, you won't like this film.  To me, Kevin Smith is at his best when putting ideas to use.  He is at his worst when engaging in physical humor or gross humor (the worst moment in the film--apart from Alana Morrissette's turn as the deity or the general ending) is the monster composed of feces).  Well, he is also good as sex jokes, though perhaps a few too many are made in the course of anyone film.  <p>Also, the movie doesn't have a good pace, and sometimes lurches forward only to rock backwards again in a few minutes.  I suppose I echo the editorial review in saying that Kevin Smith writes brilliant scripts but isn't nearly as polished as a filmmaker.<p>Moving to the good side of things.<p>It is frequently really, really funny.  I laughed a lot, and a lot of the images in the film have really stuck with me.  Like the &quot;Buddy Jesus&quot; statue from the beginning.  <p>The cast was, I thought, pretty strong, if slightly unexpected.  Not including Jay and Silent Bob (their showing up in a Kevin Smith film can hardly be termed unexpected), you get Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino (I have always had a massive crush on her), Jason Lee (the lead singer of the band in ALMOST FAMOUS, here playing a demon decked out in a splendid white suit), Salma Hayek, George Carlin, Janeane Garofalo (big crush on her also), Alan Rickman, and Chris Rock.<p>The movie is neither overly disrespectful of God (I had several friends studying for the priesthood when I was at Yale Divinity School, and I am certain they would all have had a hoot watching this) nor iconoclastic.  Overall, I recommend this movie, and if you aren't expecting perfection, I think you will get a kick out of it.<p>Kevin Smith themes:  in every one of his flicks, there are references to hockey and STAR WARS.  The former is fulfilled in obvious fashion with the hockey stick wielding punks.  The latter in having Carrie Fisher appear in a small role near the beginning of the film.  Keep a sharp eye out for her, or you might miss her.  <p>PIECE OF TRIVIA:  the old fella who gets beat up at the beginning of the movie by the hockey stick wielding punks is Bud Cort, who had a small but memorable role in the movie M*A*S*H and the title role in the Robert Altman cult flick BREWSTER MCCLOUD.  Since DOGMA he has become pretty active as a supporting actor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>Dogma to me is one of my favorites in my movie collection.  I am Catholic but this movie made me laugh so hard in so many scenes, I was not even offended by any of the movie.  Also if anyone ask me I tell them the truth like the front of the dvd cover "Faith is a funny thing."  That is actually true in so many ways,  I am forever a Kevin Smith fan after this movie.  So like I say typically if you need a good laugh and unwind from hard days work and unwind from life then pick this dvd up and laugh your butt off scene after scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>I should probably start this review by saying that Dogma was forced on me by my best friend, an avowed Kevin Smith fanatic.  Having only seen Chasing Amy before (and enjoying it a great deal), I was quite ready to dip into a movie by the same writer.  It stirred up a fair bit of controversy at the time, although having watched it I can say it's not actually that controversial.  Indeed, it's embracement of all 'ideas' comes almost perilously close to schmaltz.  Saying that, this is exactly the kind of screwball humour I love.  See, there are two disgraced angels (Damon and Affleck) who find a dogmatic loophole through which they can re-enter Heaven, thus ending the world by proving God to be fallible.  So it falls upon Linda Fiorentino's lapsed Catholic, as recruited by The Voice of God (Alan Rickman), to put a stop to their dastardly plans.  Along the way she's aided by prophets (Jay and Silent Bob), the forgotten 13th apostle (Chris Rock) and a muse (Salma Hayek).  All against Jason Lee's horn-headed baddie.<p>The humour comes thick and fast, with some absolutely classic scenes involving Damon's Loki exacting vengeance on a board meeting, Alanis Morissette's God doing handstands after defeating the apocalypse and some very very brilliant pop culture references.  The acting is also crucial, with particular stand-outs including Damon's most freewheeling role yet, Fiorentino treading a fine line between the serious and the comical and Affleck proving that with the right script and a role that doesn't reek of self-satisfaction (Pearl Harbour anyone?) he can be a very likeable, good, performer.  It of course goes without saying that the supporting cast is uniformally excellent.<p>Still, the script does pander to vulgarity several times, which you'll either lap up or resent given the nuance, interesting humour of the rest of the movie.  Smith also has a slight tendency to over-talk his script, as if to constantly to remind us that this is a satire and not something to be taken seriously.  Whilst he points out in an ironic foreword that this should be evident ten minutes in, he still feels the need to hammer it in a little too much.  Saying that though, the serious elements of the story are mostly done very well, thanks in no part to Fiorentino.  Destined to become some kind of cult classic among Smith fans, this is a much smarter and funnier comedy than any of the one I've seen this year yet.  So, whilst not brilliant perhaps, at the very least Dogma is witty, vibrant and original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Biting satire, slapstick comedy and a very heavy message plus good acting (mostly) make this film a real winner. I recommend this one to anyone who is'nt a religious nut (You know who you are) and loves good movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A39C7SEMCJWVOI.html">A39C7SEMCJWVOI</a><br/><p>DOGMA is the fourth entry in the 'New Jersey Chronicles'. The film is about a Catholic woman who is chosen to stop two renegade angels from getting back into Heaven --- and destroying all human existence in the process. Jay and Silent Bob appear as two unlikely prophets who end up joining the woman on her road trip to New Jersey where she must stop the renegade angels.

(Basically I've been austrisized by my fellow mormons for actually reading the scriptures and interpeting thier obvious meanings differently than the sunday school teacher.) I just had to say that before I gave my review. Comming from a religious background I can appreciate this film for what it is. I don't think this movie was meant to be sacreligious, just thought provoking. The movie takes many comon believes and puts new spins on them in a very entertaning way. Although I do agree that the directing could have been better, I appreciate the "ideas" introduced. Especially the analogy of faith being like a glass of water. Counter arguments for some of the ideas presented in this film exist. One must remember that Christ was a Jew, and in that day marrying outside the Jewish religion was taboo. He would not have been black, or white, but Hebrew. Another counter argument is that if god was a woman wouldn't the Bible would have been written by women? It's still kind of fun to see the variety of oppinions on religion. One thing Kevin Smith could have done before shooting the movie is research, Azreal is the angel of death, not an exiled muse, and Loki was the norse god of Pranks. That aside this movie, despite it's radical views, does have a surprisingly good message about religion in our anti-religious times. Beliefs are too hard to change, but get yourself a good idea and get this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U0DKQPZSD50Y.html">A2U0DKQPZSD50Y</a><br/><p>I am a catholic but I found this movie very funny. I love Jay and silent Bob so much and this movie helps solidify my love for them. Ben Aflek and Mat Damon put up a great preformance and Budy Christ is such a great idea afterall Jesus didn't come here to scare us he came here to be our friend</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Kevin Smith's unflinching onslaught upon organized religion that masks its intentions under the guise of an over-indulgent, goofy stoner road trip. Although he's chewing on some very thick meat in this one, a weighty, opinionated take on a touchy subject isn't quite enough to compensate for the sheer volume of quirks and trademarks the writer/director once again puts up on display. Every on-screen character speaks in long, unbroken monologues; basically mouthpieces for Smith himself. Jay and Silent Bob, the inessential links to Smith's earlier films, feel shoehorned into a plot that would've worked just as well (if not better) without them. Punchlines are virtually spelled out along the bottom of the screen, or glaringly in the backgrounds. It's a pity, because the film does have some valid points about the shortcomings of organized religion and the evolution of spirituality - particularly Catholicism - but amidst so much sinewy excess that central message is nearly clouded beyond interpretation. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, still fresh from the success of Good Will Hunting, turn in strong performances as ignorant fallen angels but ultimately find little else to work with.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>'Dogma' is an irreverent look at religion from auteur Kevin Smith. Though it was protested by religious groups it shows that Kevin Smith has obviously studied and thought about the subject quite a bit, though his view is admittedly askew. I was expecting that it would be a terrible movie, but Smith had a lot of profound thoughts and waited until he was mature enough as a film maker to tackle them. There was only a few places where the acting was as bad as in his first film, 'Clerks,' and by that I mean places where you are acutely aware that the actors are reading a script, one weighted down with a lot of philosophy and theology, and they falter under their burden. Ben Affleck, as rogue angel Bartleby, carries a lot of the excess theological baggage, so I suppose that it isn't really fair to single him out. Salma Hayek, as the muse Serendipity, was nominated for a Razzie award for worst acting--but she didn't win it!<br /><br />In 'Dogma' we have the usual Kevin Smith obsessions: New Jersey, Quick Marts, Hockey, John Hughes film references--and there is the usual cast of Jason Mewes and himself as Jay and Silent Bob, along with frequent flyers Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Jason Lee, augmented with Chris Rock as the 13th Apostle Rufus, Linda Fiorentino as Bethany Sloane, Alanis Morissette, Bud Cort, Salma Hayek, Janeane Garofalo, and Alan Rickman.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered how many angels could dance on the head of a pin, and wanted to see a movie that ponders such topics--along with pot, potty, and other sorts of tasteless jokes--then 'Dogma' is the movie for you! Not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />-----<br />Nun: You don't believe in God because of Alice in Wonderland?<br />Loki: No, "Through the Looking Glass". That poem, "The Walrus and the Carpenter" that's an indictment of organized religion. The walrus, with his girth and his good nature, he obviously represents either Buddha, or... or with his tusk, the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha. That takes care of your Eastern religions. Now the carpenter, which is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was raised a carpenter's son, he represents the Western religions. Now in the poem, what do they do... what do they do? They... They dupe all these oysters into following them and then proceed to shuck and devour the helpless creatures en masse. I don't know what that says to you, but to me it says that following these faiths based on mythological figures ensure the destruction of one's inner-being. Organized religion destroys who we are by inhibiting our actions... by inhibiting our decisions, out of... out of fear of some... some intangible parent figure who... who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says...<br />==================<br /><br />OTHER NOTABLE FILM ROLES FROM 'DOGMA' CAST MEMBERS<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY">De-Lovely</a> (2004) ....

We All know he is a Talented Writer, but his Directing skills are Far from Polished. No Tricky Camera work, no Imagination in the Shots, he just Points and Shoots. With all of his Previous films, he could just blame the Lack of Budget as the reason the Production wasn't Top Notch, but Here, he has no Excuses. An A-List Cast, a Good Budget and a Bucket Load of Potential... Kevin's Script and Directing are the Letdowns.<p>Now to the Performances... I'll Start with the Great ones. <p>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon may play Fallen Angels in the film, but for Kevin Smith, they are a God Send. They make his Dialogue sound Great and when they are on the Screen, the Film is at it's Best. Jason Lee is a Close Second, (Ben and Matt tied for First) as he and Ben have worked with Kevin a couple of times before, ("Chasing Amy" and "Mall Rats") they know how to deliver his dialogue. They are to Kevin what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare. Alan Rickman comes off Next Best, every time he was on screen; I had an Ear-to-Ear smile. Jay and Silent Bob are as Good as Ever, their Comedic Styles are as Fresh as Ever and they don't look like they'll be getting Dull any time soon.<p>The Same cannot be said for Linda Fiorentino, Salma Heyek or Chris Rock. They have been given Large Quantities of Dialogue which could Easily have been given the Chop, it Embarasses them and Bores the Audience. Every time they open their mouths, Biblical Speeches follow and It slows the film to a Crawl. Especially Chris Rock, he does his best with the films Worst Lines, not even Eddie Murphy could have saved This Character.<p>Overall, it is Worth Seeing. Opinions of "Dogma" Vary like you Wouldn't Believe. To some It the Best Movie Ever, to others, it's the Worst. You just may be One of the Many who Adore it.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>As it says in "My Sunday Dogma Missal" which accompanies this DVD, "I'm banking on the fact that God has a great sense of humor." Cited as evidence is the platypus.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary, even a supernaturally funny movie. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are two fallen angels, Bartleby and Loki, who have discovered a loophole in God's law that will allow them to get back into heaven. However, the Voice of God (Alan Rickman; you know, Snape?) says if they make it, all existence will end. Something about God having been proved wrong, or something. Such a contradiction would bring down the whole works.<br /><br />So the Voice of God appears to the Last Scion (I'll let him explain that) and convinces her she's got to go to New Jersey and stop Bartleby and Loki from getting a plenary indulgence by entering a newly rededicated church run by the trendy new age bishop played by George Carlin. Along the way, she meets more crazy divine characters than you or I could imagine. But Kevin Smith, who wrote and directed the film, has way more imagination than you and I put together. It's good he does, too, because he's mixed together some of the most incredible twists and turns on a plot that, amazingly, makes a certain amount of sense.<br /><br />It is to laugh, of course, but it is also really about God and religion. And so you might find yourself believing this alternate reality is more rational than the one we are currently living in.<br /><br />Five stars. Really. Earned every one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Just like Mallrats, the cover kicks ass!!! The special features in this dvd isn't too shaby either.

I can't believe I mentioned Ben Affleck and a "good scene" together in the same sentance. The only films he's ever good in are Kevin Smith movies. Jay and Silent Bob are funny in this too. The weird thing about this movie is knowing what to classify it under. Comedy? Drama? Action? You need to see this movie!!!!!and buy it.....</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Dogma caused such a controversy, especially among a small but vocal group called the Catholic League, that the normally liberal distributor, Miramax Films, sold the right to a small company called Lions Gate. Weeks before the movie opened, the League sent out numerous letters and E-mails that asked people to boycott the film. If there is a lesson to be learned in all this, it is a reminder that we shouldn't judge things sight unseen. Dogma certainly pokes much fun at the Catholic church as an institution, but ultimately it is one of the more spiritual movies of the last decade. It's main fault is its tendency to delve into theological questions that many non-Catholics will not understand. It is much less insidious that the recent End of Days, which had homicidal Catholic priests running around preaching mumbo-jumbo. <p>It seems that a few thousand years ago, a couple of angels named Bartleby and Loki [Ben Affleck and Matt Damon] got tossed out of Heaven for refusing to do their jobs. They were banished to Wisconsin, where they still reside toady. In New Jersey, a hip archbishop is trying to make the church less stodgy and more appealing. The banished angels discover that when the archbishop rededicates a cathedral there, a portal will open which will allow them to go back to Heaven. All will be forgiven. There is a little problem with their doing this. When they go through the portal, it will prove that God can be wrong and is, therefore, fallible. Since everything is predicated on the Almighty's being always right, their reentry will cause the universe to cease to exist. Bartleby and Loki are willing to risk this. Anything to get out of the Midwest, I presume.<p>Things are about to change dramatically for Bethany Sloane [Linda Fiorentino], a reasonably well adjusted young woman who works at an abortion clinic. She's definately a lapsed Catholic. One night a fiery angel called Metatron [Alan Rickman] appears at the foot of her bed. She tries to put him out with a fire extinguisher, only to find it's really hard to get rid of a persistent immortal. He wisks her off in her night clothes to a Mexican restaurant, where he informs her that she is The Chosen One, the one charged with preventing Bartleby and Loki's passing through the portal. He tells her she will be aided by two prophets, who soon appear as two spaced out drifters. These guys may be carrying a message, but they certainly don't know it. Soon the trio, aided by Rufus, who claims he was the thirteenth apostle, are hurrying towards their date with destiny. Along the way, they are threatened by Loki and Bartleby, as well as Azarael [Jason lee], an avenging angel with an attitude. <p>Frankly, any attempt to explain the plot makes the whole thing seem somewhat sacrilegious. The movie isn't that at all. Dogma can be defined as a doctrine concerning faith or morals authoritatively proclaimed by a church, and the picture is much more faithful to the dogma of the Catholic church than almost any film I have seen. I can only imagine that what caused such a stir about the movie is that it is a comedy. And a very funny one, at that. I still contend that, if the Church is ever actually damaged by movies, the harm is done by 'serious' psycho-babble dramas like The Omen and The Exorcist. That's because such fare, while highly entertaining, tends to portray Catholics as superstitious and as very vulnerable to any whim Satan may have. Satan isn't even around in Dogma, a movie which, if it does anything at all, promotes spirituality, albeit with a smirk, a grin and a multitude of profanities.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F7CCPK4QL359.html">A2F7CCPK4QL359</a><br/><p>Writer/director Kevin Smith's all star,religious socal commentary is a HOOT to watch, and draws on religion points.

That's meant to be a compliment, by the way.  The DVD is pretty good (considering censoring on the commentaries and the missing documentary from...um, well let's just call them Di$ney), and includes an hour and a half of deleted stuff (a lot of continuity issues are addressed here, and a few scenes would have been nice to see in the film's release), plus there are some insanely funny outtakes (Matt Damon's theories on &quot;Star Wars&quot; seal the deal for me).  Add to that some rather funny menus (feel guilty for buying this DVD with the opinions of a elderly &quot;church-goer&quot;) and some funny commentaries from the cast and crew, and you got a &quot;must-buy&quot; for fans of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p><p>This movie is like a who's who of Hollywood.  Salma Hayek...Chris Rock...Matt Damon...Ben Affleck...Alanis Morrisette?!? <p>This is the story of two fallen angels (Damon and Affleck) who find a loophole to get into heaven.  But there is one catch.  Doing so will undo existence as we know it.  The last scion is dispatched to save existence and does, with a little help from the 13th apostle (Rock), a muse (Hayek) and 2 unlikely prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). <p>There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  Other than a rather bloody ending, this movie is hysterical.  George Carlin is hilarious as Cardinal Glick and Alanis Morrisette as...well you have to see it to find out!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>Ironic that this movie is condemned by the Catholic League since everything in it is extremely Catholic. Almost every seminary student should watch this thing. Pretty much the story about bitter angels trying  to get into Heaven follows the same theological conundrum posed by the  Prophecy (ie, G-d's messengers really hate the human race) but it is  extremely silly for the most part.<p>Cute scenes in the movie include the  blessed golf clubs, the whole &quot;angels can't have sex&quot; scenes,  Alanis Morrisette as G-d, and the poop monster.<p>Strengths include Chris  Rock, Alan Rickman as well as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as the angels. Jay  &amp; Silent Bob are funny but most of their jokes were in the comic books  already (including going to the town where all the John Hughes movies took  place to pick up Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy). George Carlin is  hilarious but that's mostly because he's George Carlin.<p>Irritating parts  of the movie included the hockey playing demons, the demon character and  Linda Fiorentino's character (Smith still can't write female characters  very well, but at least he's trying unlike Mamet who just sticks a woman in  the movie for no reason whatsoever.)<p>And I was personally disturbed by  the fact that Salma Hayak's character was a sexless angel. But that's just  my personal problem and doesn't really detract from the movie. Hayak is  either really irritating or really good in movies (pretty much mostly  Rodriguez movies is where she shines.) and in this one she's pretty  good.<p>So rent it out or buy it. It's a fun movie. Just don't expect the  greatest movie ever made. Kevin Smith may one day direct an amazingly  beautiful and deep movie, but for now he directs enjoyable comedies which  shouldn't be taken as anything more.<p>Oh yeah, I kinda have to agree on  the camera angle thing too. Nothing in this movie is all that visually  interesting, but there were some nice shots and it is getting better.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>You see Kevin Smith films for the dialogue, not the cinematography. He really is a great writer with a quarky mind. He has some fascinating ideas. A major disappointment with this DVD is a lack of extras. A commentary  track from Smith would have been great and made this one a must in a  collection.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>This film explores some of the more off beat aspects of Christanity in a funny way. If you want to really upset some of the more shall we say less flexible "Christain" friends and relatives who show up at your home. Then pop this film into the machine and watch the fumes arise. The thing to remember is not to take the film too seriously!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Kevin Smith is no doubt a brilliant writer, and even though his directing skills could use some polish, Dogma is a step above his other films (well, except Chasing Amy).  The storyline is one of those that you have to pay a lot of attention to though; Linda Fiorentino stars as a Catholic woman that works in an abortion clinic and is more and more losing her faith.  One night she is visted by "The Voice of God" (Alan Rickman) and given an assignment to stop two banished angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from re-entering heaven through a loophole in the Catholic Dogma, and will thus destroy all existence.  She is teamed up with good ol' Jay & Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith), the unknown 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) and a rather sexy muse who works in a strip club (Salma Hayek who steals the entire movie).  Jason Lee is fantastic as the horned Azrael who has a few tricks up his own sleeve, and George Carlin is funny as Cardinal Glick.  But what makes Dogma work is that there is a lot of truth about religion that is discussed and joked about in the movie, mainly Salma Hayek's character talking about what is right and wrong about organized religion, and Matt Damon convincing a nun to quit her faith are some brilliant dialogue that will make the viewer think if he has an open mind.  All in all, Dogma isn't really as controversial as some say it is, but those with unique tastes will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>This is a smart comedy about religion and the Church. We find a great cast of different stars playing God, angels, demons, muses, prophets and apostles. I can understand that for some people religion is a very serious issue and that these individuals may take offense in this movie. However, if you do no belong in this group, I highly recommend you to watch this film, since I am sure you will have a great time.<p>The Church is in a renewal process and seeking to attract people to enlarge its flock. Some of the changes involve revamping the depressing image in the crucifix for a smiling, winking and thumbs-up Christ. Also, a Church in New Jersey decreed a day in which everyone that passes through its gates will be cleansed of all sins and forgiven by God. Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are two angles that have incurred in God's wrath and therefore were expelled from heaven and condemned to live in Wisconsin from the rest of their eternal lives. They see this as an opportunity to be forgiven and allowed to return to heaven.<p>The path to their destination is not an easy one though, since by achieving their forgiveness they would prove God wrong, and existence will cease because it is based on the fact that God is always right. Therefore, Loki's and Bartleby's journey affects a large number of people and other mystic figures. There are two sides to the conflict, those that want to prevent them from getting to their destination, and those that want to help them and create chaos. Among muses, demons, the thirteenth apostle and a Golgothan, which by the way is super gross, we find a woman named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino). She is at a tough stage in her life and has almost lost her faith, but is requested by Metathron, the voice of God, to stop the two angels in their quest.<p>The way in which the film questions some of the beliefs of religion is smart and funny, and the talented cast help make this a very pleasant experience. For example, Chris Rock in his role of the thirteenth apostle is hilarious, showing his usual sense of humor with quick and witty jokes. I also found interesting the questioning of God's sex and Jesus race, which I think spices up several scenes throughout the movie and allows for some very funny moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>Jay and Silent Bob help the "last Zion" Bethany Sloane to stop two fallen angels from destroying the world and ending reality.<br /><br />Publicity were plagued with controversy over a perceived anti-Christian message read into the film. So please before you think about hurting someone over this trifle of a film, remember: even God has a sense of humor. Just look at the Platypus. Thank you and enjoy the show. {wikipedia}</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>There are very few films were one can compliment both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in their acting efforts.  Besides "Good Will Hunting", this is another one of those efforts.  Cast of the movie is fantastic.  Alan Rickman is great in his role as voice of God and it is delightfull surprise to learn that the God is in form of beautiful and serene Alanis Morisette.  Chris Rock will not fail you as one of the "forgotten" apostole (13th one that happens to be black).  Unless you are an individual  too serious about your Catholic faith, or just too God fearing Christian in general, you will find this movie to be smart, funny and very entertaining.  I will be the first one to admit that I did not expect much of this movie and I got a very nice treat.  This is one of the comedies that you will always think of fondly  - if you are humble enough to laugh at yourself.  I believe that every one of us can see themselves or someone close we know in this colorful display of characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>We start out with an old man in front of a skeeball location getting the snot beat out of him, then a flash to the story. Evidently two ejected angels sent to Wisconsin for the duration have found a loophole that will allow them to return to Heaven unscathed. Seems that no one from above or below really wants this to happen. So several beings with their own agenda are coercing Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) to do their dirty work as she unknowingly is the only one qualified.<br /><br />Will Bethany be able to stop the two angels before it is too late? Or is there a sinister unnamed force helping the fallen angels to succeed?<br /><br />Some of the actors are just coasting through the movie (probably to pick up some spending cash).  But Alan Rickman is excellent as usual and plays the indignant part to the hilt. See him again in "Galaxy Quest" made the same year.<br /><br />Defiantly designed for certain genre tastes (sort of a cross between Ghost Busters and Monty Python with a little Arthur Miller tossed in.) I personally found it a tad too potty mouthed and over obsessed with sex. Other than that it brings up good premises and a few eternal questions. This is defiantly on of those films that need to be viewed more than once to pick up on the nuances'<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0822202492">The Creation of the World and Other Business.</a></p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>The first time I saw "Dogma" I was put off by the endless explanations of Catholic&#8230; well&#8230; dogma.  Director/screenwriter Kevin Smith knew that the subject matter he was tackling would go over the heads of his audience if not adequately explained (ideas such as plenary indulgence, the last scion, or the Metatron are not part of the popular dialogue).  He did a good job tackling these ideas, only the explanation tended to drag down the rest of the movie.  And it left little room for character development (Linda Fiorentino spends most of the movie's first half saying "I don't understand" to either Alan Rickman or Chris Rock).  Upon viewing the film a second time, being more comfortable with the material myself, I was able to relax and enjoy the jokes Smith placed within those explanations, and go along for the ride with his well-plotted and superbly structured story.  Further to this, those performances that felt stilted and stale behind the veil of explanation are now fresh and vibrant.  I didn't appreciate the work of Fiorentino, Rock, Jason Lee, Salma Hayek, or Ben Affleck the first time around.  Now I see that they are a uniformly solid ensemble.  Couple this with the standout performance of Mr. Rickman, a playful but malevolent Matt Damon, and a beatific Alanis Morrissette, and Smith seems to have found the perfect cast of characters.<p>"Dogma" is a big movie with a big brain that it's not afraid to use, a Smith trademark.  This may come as a surprise to those who know Smith as a (self-admitted) purveyor of [...] and fart jokes.  Don't worry, the auteur has not turned his back on his bread and butter.  The bathroom humour runs wild and free here.  But it's not bathroom humour for the sake of bathroom humour.  This is seen most clearly in the famous and much reviled Golgothan S**t-Demon scene.  It exists not just as an excuse to dress up a man in a poo suit, but actually makes sense given the universe of the film.<p>Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) do more here than in any previous Smith film.  They come to the story early on, stay until the end, and carry much of the film's comedy.  Jay is his usual motormouth self, only his ribald banter is consistently funnier than in any previous films.  Silent Bob is once again 99% silent, taking a couple of occasions to save the day (without the clumsiness he displayed in "Mallrats").  And in one heartbreaking scene near the end, Smith, a self-confessed non-actor, actually wrings some true pain and sadness without resorting to weepy hysterics.  A good job.<p>As for the film's supposed anti-religious angle, anyone that pays attention to the ideas being presented will know that couldn't be further from the truth.  The only religion that gets condemned is the kind that's organized.  Smith is more concerned with a return to faith, in whatever form that it may take.  It attacks belief, which is cold and unyielding and harmful to those who don't share it, in favour of ideas, which can respond to most any human situation.  Smith deserves credit in that he has made a movie that gave me, a self-styled lapsed Jew and agnostic, cause to question my beliefs.  And I think that was Smith's goal in the first place<p>Besides taking on organized religion, "Dogma" is also -- in many of the film's aside lines -- a loving tribute to movies and how they can affect our consciousness, a noble ideal that this film strides towards and succeeds.  If film is the new religion in our liberal culture, then "Dogma" would make fine scripture.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>This review will only talk about the features included on this DVD edition.  My review of the movie proper was posted August 20, 2001. <p>---<p>Since commentary tracks are the most important feature, to me, of any DVD, and since this is my first time listening to one (well, two here) of Kevin Smith's legendary commentary tracks, let me get right at it.<p>Messrs. Smith, Affleck, Mewes, Lee, Mosier, and Pereira appear on the first track.  The Jays, Mewes and Lee, don't contribute all that much; the former adds a spaced-out comment or two, but only when prompted, giving cause for the others to ridicule his grammar; the latter only pipes up to ask director Smith a technical question once in a while.  Vinnie Pereira, who is described as View Askew's resident historian, is proven negligent on several occasions, for not knowing some detail or another.  Which, to me, proves that he's probably right most of the time, and only got called on it while the audience was in the room, for the purpose of some good-natured ridicule.  Scott Mosier, producer and second unit director, answers any and all technical questions that Smith can't, and takes some all-in-good-fun flak for his cameo in the film, a scene on the bus where he's asked to make-out with his girlfriend.  Ben Affleck, far and away the biggest star in the room, is both incredibly articulate on why he's proud of the movie and his role in it, and good-natured at being the butt of many of his lesser-known cohorts' jokes.  Kevin Smith, writer/director, is funny and forthcoming with his feelings about the movie.  He doesn't shy away from the on-set conflict between Linda Fiorentino and himself, he's outspoken about the undue criticism the film received, and he's self-deprecating when talking about his skills (or lack thereof) as a director and his reliance on toilet humour in his writings.  The track is fun and funny, like listening to a bunch of guys at a bar on a particularly witty and combative night.  It's not afraid to go off-topic (at one point a discussion breaks out on the sex-lives of the participants during the making of the movie!), but still manages to cram in more behind the scenes information than most commentary tracks I've heard.<p>The second commentary track features only Smith, Mosier, and Pereira, and was included because the first track was so jokey and off-topic at times.  Smith and Co. wanted to at least appear like real filmmakers who knew what they were doing.  So they try and talk about aspect ratios, and film stock, and optical transfers, etc.  Which is all well and good, but they also joke around enough to make this track interesting in its own right, while still being funny for non-techno geeks.<p>Besides the two commentary tracks, the 2 DVD set holds a number of other fine features.<p>Included in packages liner notes is a lengthy and finely written essay by Smith, which details how and (more importantly) why he made this film.  In it, he lays his soul bare, giving up his love for God, and his desire to honour Him (or Her) with an intelligent movie that the masses will see.  The only way to do that, he reasons, is by lacing the theologically motivated story with "... and fart jokes".  A job well done, Kev.<p>Disc two has over 100 minutes of deleted scenes that prove why they were deleted.  They are often ponderous, and would have been detrimental to the narrative, even while fleshing out each character's backstory.  The interesting part about this feature is that each scene is introduced by Pereira and an increasingly larger contingent of the Smith clan, beginning with just Kevin, then him and his daughter, then him and his daughter and his wife, and finally him and his "other" son, Jason Mewes.  It's kind of cute to see Kevin, a self-described raunchmeister, in the company of his wholesome family.<p>The outtakes section was a disappointment.  With over 3.5 hours of usable footage, you'd think the produces would have been able to cobble together more than 13 minutes of crack-ups and muggings.  But they haven't.  Pity.<p>Overall, the DVD is a fine package.  Two minor quibbles: the opening sequence, which plays while the disc loads, was funny the first time.  But it's too long.  It became annoying when every time I put the DVD in this drawn out joke had to play.  Also, when transferring between features, a short condemnation, presumably riffing on the grief the film got from the Catholic League, appears, telling the audience that they're probably going to burn for watching the movie.  I appreciate the irony, but not every time I wanted to turn the subtitles on.  This got tiresome pretty quickly, too.  But besides those two points, "Dogma" is presented in all its splendor, deservedly so.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>two angels,who were kicked out of heaven long ago,find a loop-hole so they may return.they need to go to new jersey.jay and silent bob go with the last zion,the 13th apostle rufis-left out of the bible because hes black,and the muse join forces to prevent this for if the angels get to heaven all creation will go poof!it stars matt damon and ben affleck as the 2 angels.alanis morriseete as god,chris rock is rufis and even george carlin as a bishop in the church.of the jay and silent bob movies it ranks second id say,but a lot of people say its the best also.it is the best religious based movie of all time!however,it will piss off all church goers.no naked chicks in this one either.chris rock,although normaly one of the most obnoxious racist bigots alive,actualy doesnt bitch too much in this one.he does make a good point that if there is a christian god-and lets face it theres probaly not-hes black.why would he be anything else?the world started in AFRica right?i abselutely love this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>The only reason I watched this film was for Ben Affleck, I've wanted to see it for ages, but never got the chance to, or gone out of my way to buy it on DVD. But I did enjoy it, even if it was a bit weird. I definitely want it on DVD now, to shed some more light on the (many) bits that I did not understand! <p>I'm not a fan of Matt Damon (Loki), he generally annoys the hell out of me, so that was one bit of the film I didn't like. Ben Affleck (Bartleby) was cute though - especially when he was angry! They play the good angel/bad angel, constantly switching back and forth. <p>There are a few familiar faces in this, apart from the obvious - George Carlin (Bill & Ted - rock on dudes!), the chain-smoking girl from Romy & Michele's High School Reunion, Jay & Silent Bob, Chris Rock (Rufus), Salma Hayek (Serendipity) and Alan Rickman. The latter was definitely brilliant, so sarcastic! Jay & Silent Bob just have to be in every Kevin Smith film, and they totally remind me of the guys from Wayne's World (watch out for the bits in the car). I wasn't keen on them, although Silent Bob plays a great part, and manages to make up for what he doesn't say, with facial expressions etc. He was so funny!<p>There are two classic lines in this film. Ben's "Do I come across as gay?" and Alan Rickman's "If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing about." So true! <p>I thought this was along the lines of The Prophecy, although better! Also, watch out for the toilet scene - similar to the one in Trainspotting, but much, much worse!<p>Being a film mainly about religion, there's quite a lot to take in, but it is easy to follow. The story also makes you think, especially what Rufus says about Mary & Joseph. A lot of the stuff went straight over my head, due to not being in any way religious myself, but I know the basics. The Apostles etc, didn't make any sense to me, but maybe would to others, who know all this stuff. I did enjoy this film, and would highly recommend it to anyone. I'll definitely be keeping my eye out for the DVD, with plenty of extras, which explain the film more in-depth, and a commentary. <p>Oh, and the end credits are great, although they were severely truncated by watching it on TV. And God is a woman? Something we women have known for a long time!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>As a sweet bite of blaspemy this Kevin Smith stinker may do fine, supported by a star-studded cast and a crunchily inventive premise to sink our collective teeth into the heart of Catholicism. <p>But it is amusing to see a horde of reviewers call this clever and thoughtful. Sorry folks, the film's troop of eccentric characters do very little to bail it out of its convoluted ramble about theology.  <p>When it comes to intellectual muck-raking, the film with its doozy &quot;loophole&quot; simply drowns under the weight of diminishing returns. Religion is not an intellectual exercise, it's role is to fulfill spiritual, psychological and emotional needs in our lives. A person needs his world to make some sense to them, and religion can comfort with answers that science can not yet provide. <p>If on the other hand you're game for some tongue-in-cheek degenerative humor (for example, giant monsters of bubbling human excrement) sure, this may be right up your alley. Just make sure you have plenty of time as the circus goes on for a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>I seen this movie in the theatres when it came out and fell in love with it from beginning to end.

This is a film about spirituality aimed at 11 year olds.  I found the film extraordinarily simplistic, boring, and obnoxious.  The charcters are really annoying, and the performances are quite bad (with Jason Lee coming across the worst as a devil like dude).  Affleck and Damon's characters end up being another variation on the know it all, smug, Gen X type who thinks he has all the answers, and enjoys pointing out everyone else's faults.  This was supposed to be Smith's "profound" film, but he's way out of his depth here.  Gen X filmmakers like Smith are not known for tackling big subjects, and when Kevin tries to tackle the heavy questions of existence here, he fails miserably.  Even though the film is a comedy, it still fails to really get into anything worthwhile.  It comes across as "existence for dummies".  Smith's previous film, Chasing Amy (his best in my opinion), is actually more profound than this film is.  It's an overly silly movie about religion.  I was just offended by the bad acting and filmmaking, not by the so-called "blasphemy" of the film.  The Catholic Church who protested this film were fools for doing so.  There's nothing worth bothering about here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>I found DOGMA to be such a monumental waste of time that it set a real precedent in my life for a wasted evening.  As someone who can enjoy almost any well-intentioned movie this film was a total waste of time, energy and resources.  Since I am a lifelong confirmed horror and sci-fi fan I am not the least "high brow", nor do I hold any strong opinions regarding organized religion. I also would not consider myself to be prudish in any way and irreverence towards organized religion has never bothered me enough to spoil a good film.<br /><br />When I went to the theater to see DOGMA I was on vacation in Newport Road Island with my wife when a trusted friend recommended that we see this film. The party in question shall remain nameless, but after seeing this movie I questioned his sincerity and certainly his advice from that day on. We also were not able to see the very excellent GREEN MILE which was also playing, and I suppose I regret missing that film as much as catching this one.<br /><br />I am also dismayed at the number of multi-star votes this film received on Amazon. It would appear that the producer, director or some vast left wing conspiracy must be members of a large "family" (or some other organization) who have a vested interest in this film.  I simply can't believe the outcome of the Amazon statistics. Someone has been stuffing the ballot box!</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>I should note that I didn't come from a Catholic family, so I'm not in the potential audience for this film.  Never the less, this fact is no excuse for 'Dogma's being as mindbogglingly annoying as it is.  Every character, every damn one of them is agonizingly obnoxious, it's just unbelievable.  Any one of them could cripple a scene all by his or herself, yet there are often many of the on the screen at once.  Take the most involved scene in this film then add in, say, Kathy Griffin and Chris Tucker, and it would cause my head to explode within seconds.  Frankly, I'd probably be better off.<br /><br />Still, every time this thing comes on TV, which is about every other day on Comedy Central, I can't help but watch a little of it.  I don't know why.  Do I hate myself? Am I a masochist?  Or do I have to prove to myself every time I see it that it's really as bad as I think it is?  Suffice to say, this isn't necessarily the worst movie I've ever seen, but I honestly can't think of a single movie that I HATE more than 'Dogma'.<br /><br />Grade: F<br />(P.S. I read that the DVD comes with 100(!) mintues of deleted scenes.  This thought makes me tremble in horror.  It's best not to contemplate such things.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>This shallow film is but pretentious garbage for the new age crowd who think they've found a profound message in their little crystal beads and yoga books.  Although somewhat creative in terms of plot, the script and acting are about as shallow as the pompous message it seeks to propagate.<br /><br />The story follows two fallen angels played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon who know a way to return to heaven without God knowing it; thereby proving Her imperfect and bringing an end to Her supposedly perfect creation. Yes, to keep up with modern liberal trends God decided to have a sex change operation for this movie.  A woman named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is called upon by two stoner prophets (Smith and Jason Mewes) to take her safely to her destination to stop God's errant angels.  The blunt messages passing off as subtly symbolic are laughable (i.e. the new Virgin Mary working in an abortion clinic.)  Wow! What creative powers of imagination!  Maybe they should have made their points more subtle such as Jay and Silent Bob using condoms for example or Chris Rock as the 13th apostle being not only married but polygamous.  Why not have the female God get a divorce while they're at it?  But since this screenplay is an attack on Christian hippocricy, why name Matt Damon's  hesitant protagonist character 'Loki' (a mischevious Nordic god having nothing to do with Christianity) while virtually every other character has a biblical name? To appear creative I suppose.  Perhaps the most irritating was Alanis Morissette as God: as if her singing isn't bad enough we have to watch her act too? Yes, of course! Let's have another retro-60s hippie high on acid passing as God to show how pious the tasteless fashions and mannerisms of that period were! C-o-o-o-l d-u-u-d-e! The fact that she was silent throughout was the one good thing about her acting in this film.  The only good performance in this film was by Alan Rickman as the voice of God but his role lasted only 10 minutes (fortunately for him as it avoided a lot of embarrassment.)<br /><br />I am agnostic and, quite frankly, I'd rather sit through 2 hours of Catholic mass than watch this phoney attempt at intellectualism and spiritualism.  Spare me! The people involved in this film have too little of an intellect to work on such grandiose themes: they need to stay with silly little things  worthy of their childish talents like 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' for example.  Avoid at all costs!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I went into Dogma with relatively high hopes.  After all, the team of Affleck and Damon seemed relatively intelligent, relatively imaginative, and successful enough to push something original past the studio types.  I was wrong.  Dogma is a cynical, self-important little film that takes on big topics.  But unlike inspired, creative films that often hold up well in such fights, Dogma is like a frail, blind tabby in a cat fight.  It's so busy tripping over topics and ideas that can't get its paws on, that you want to turn your eyes away in embarassment.<p>The worst part of Dogma is the odd preachiness of it, as if some half-baked philosophy major is trying to explain the Truth to you after a half-dozen Amaretto sours at the college pub.  You can almost imagine the sophmoric sessions where such &quot;great&quot; ideas surfaced, including the &quot;inspired&quot; decision to to cast George Carlin as a Cardinal.  (&quot;He's Catholic, man!  Do you get it?  You should hear his early albums where he talks about Catholic school!  How cool is that!  Wouldn't it be awesome if ...&quot;)  That's one of the problems with Hollywood.  Filmmakers are a bright, iconoclastic lot in general, but they usually are neither well-read nor particularly insightful.  And maybe that is appealling to the large group of 18 to 35 year olds who wouldn't know Erasmus if he hit them over the head with a lectern.  But for anyone looking for a genuine, intelligent satire about organized religion, skip this and get The Meaning of Life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>Ah, Mooby...<p>Kevin Smith is one of the hottest young filmmakers today. And it is no wonder, he makes great films--Clerks (what he did on such a small budget and his work as an indie film), Chasing Amy (not your typical Kevin Smith movie, but a great film, Dogma (the best of what he has done), and even Mallrats was good, though it did poorly at the box office and Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back (his spoof of himself). But Dogman is his crowning achievement.<p>Dogma is easily in the top 100 movies ever made. Smith's dialogue is on par. It's a great satire as well as a philosophical/theological statement (the thinking man's movie). And done his way--the independant way. Smith does a great job directing, and his script is well-written (though he is flexible enough to make changes while shooting). And Smith and his producer Scott Mosier do their own editing--a real bonus as it helps keep the director's vision alive.<p>Smith also pulls out some great performances in this film. Linda Fiorentino plays the main role of Bethany Sloane. She does a good job, but her performance is below the rest of the cast. She is just a little too low-key. Matt Damon gives a brilliant performance, and even Ben Affleck (and actor I have little respect for) gives a solid performance, though he tends to be upstaged by Damon. Alan Rickman gives a respectable performance. Chris Rock and Salma Hayek are wonderful. Jason Lee is great, as he always is (easily the best performance of the film). Of course you have Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as our favorite duo - Jay and Silent Bob. Great job guys. And there are good performances by George Carlin, Alanis Morissette (a particularly hard role since there is no dialogue), Janean Grafalo (oh how I wish she had been casted as Bethany, the role was made for her), Better Aberlin (as the Nun--you know which one), Dwight Ewell, Ethan Suplee (as the Golgothan), and of course Walt Flanagan. There are a few glitches and a few casting questions, but overall Smith pulls great work out of his actors. <p>As a dvd, Smith puts together a #1 package for his fans. First of all it comes in a nice slipcover case instead of that cheap packaging so man dvds come in. His menus are interactive, cartoonish, and very entertaining. There's this odd 'grandma' lady running around the dvd. She's great. There are two commentaries. The first is your typical Kevin Smith commentary: the cast and crew sitting around, eating, and cracking jokes, occasionally talking about the movie. and of course, you have Affleck hamming it up trying to get the spotlight on him with absolutely nothing to say. The second commentary is a technical commentary, with only Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier (producer, and it was his idea to do this track), and Vincent Pererra (View Askew 'official' historian). This commentary focuses on 'the how' of how the film was made. A value for any independant filmmaker, especially since Smith doesn't fall back on money and CGI. It's a shame he didn't include a commentary track like this on his previous films (but maybe there were enough complaints and that is why we have it here). And on disc 2 - There are over and hour and half of deleted scenes, storyboards (for the mooby sequence, triplet attack sequence, and no man attack sequence), outtakes, the trailer, and advertisement for Kevin Smith's comic books store Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, and one of the most interestingly done filmographies/biographies I've ever seen on a dvd. This is how dvds should be done. All you other filmmakers and distributors, take a good, long look at this dvd, and learn from Kevin Smith. This is what we pay for, this is what we want (in addition to a good movie).<p>And I end with this: picture it--the Buddy Christ.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>"Dogma" has got to be one of the most orignal movies that I have ever seen. It is a religious comedy that is always funny and always interesting. The only thing that you could do during "Dogma" is to listen to the dialouge. It works so well and the dialouge is often used by people just because it is so fresh and things like that have never been said before. The same has to do with most of writer/director Kevin Smith's work. He is the one who brought us the great movie "Clerks," and other comedy greats like "Mallrats," and "Chasing Amy." I've only seen four of the five movies that Kevin Smith made, but this one is probally my favorite because of its story. I love the story and I love the humor. Crude, yet appropiate for the movie. People often wonder WHY this movie has such strong profanity and crude and sexual humor, but those people just don't seem ot understand. These are the kind of characters that use profanity and crude humor. Its just that kind of person, like you and me. Kevin Smith makes these characters perfect which is another reason why this movie works so well.<p>The star of the movie is Bethany Sloan, who works at an abortion clinic, and has to deal with the protestors with signs like "Child Murderer." Events in her life has began to question her belief in God, but everything changes when she meets Metatron, the voice of God, who has a job for her. Cardinal Glick has designed a Church during its 100th year that has an archway that could lead to return of two banished angels Bartleby and Loki. Since God banished them, and his choice is infallible, it would prove that God is wrong, and the universe would just be nothing. The church is in New Jersey and Bethany is aided by two "prophets" by the names of stoners Jay and Silent Bob. Jay lets Bethany go along with him on the hopes of being able to sleep with her in the end, and Silent Bob, barely speaks. They also meet Rufus the 13th apostle who is never heard of and is now forgotten, and Serendipity, a muse with writers block who is right now pretending to be a stripper. God becomes missing, and Bethany and her group get to New Jersey while dealing with the demon Azruel and his street hockey gang of thugs. Azruel is hoping to help the two angels so that he could get his revenge of God. Bartleby and Loki get closer and closer to New Jersey, but Bethany cannot give up all everything in the universe would just...disappear.<p>When I first saw the movie I never saw anything of its kind. I feel that when it was released it could have recieved and Oscar for Best Orignal Screenplay. It was a critically acclaimed film that has many fans, and many people who don't want to see it at all. But those are the people who are missing out of this fun. It has an all-star cast. Linda Fiorentino, George Carlin, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock. Salma Hayek, and Jason Lee, all of which have huge comedic talent and are perfect in their roles.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for strong language including sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug content.</p></br></body></html>

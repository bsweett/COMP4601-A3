But, this review was written on the complaint of the release of the unsuspecting un-playability of the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />I have a Sony Blu-Ray Player, and this Blu-Ray disc of "Starship Troopers" is released by Sony.  But, guess what?  This Sony Blu-Ray player will not play this Sony Blu-ray disc.  I understand that I'm suppose to go out a buy a flash drive for my Sony Blu-Ray Player to play this movie.<br /><br />I gotta buy a flash drive just to play one movie?  How stupid is that?!  The movie doesn't even say on the box that I will be required to buy a flash drive if I want to watch this movie.  No wonder there were so many of these copies of "Starship Troopers" in the used BD bin at the used CD store.<br /><br />First Sony creates a wonderful CD burning program called ATRAC and SonicStage.  When I get nearly my whole CD library condensed to just a boxful of 33 hour CDR's, they discontinue the program so that I will not be able to burn anymore ATRAC CDR's, or buy another ATRAC CDR player in the future.<br /><br />Now, they release movies on Blu-Ray that you will not be allowed to play unless you buy a flash drive.  So, I guess this BD version of "Starship Troopers" returns to the used BD rack at the record store with the rest of them.<br /><br />Well that's it!  I will never buy another Sony product again.  They are just too inconsistent with what people will embrace with their product, and will then discontinue it without a damn that people have added their unique technology to their lifestyle, as that of their SonicStage program.  And I will not waste money on a flash drive since my DVD of "Starship Troopers" looks just fine anyway.<br /><br />Live and learn!</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>Paul Verhoeven makes thrillers that are insidiously entertaining, they smash you in the face with their nervy visuals and often silly dialog.  This movie is no exception; however, it also boasts a mesmerizing parallel to the recruitment films used in Nazi Germany.  It has that austere, spare, let's go to war for all the right reasons feel to it. The cast is impossibly gorgeous and cut, much like Hitler youth as fashionable teens in outer space.  The special effects are nerve-jangling and robust; this is a grade-B movie with some high gloss.  For the best Paul Verhoeven film ever, see if you can find The Fourth Man, which is in Dutch -- it has the same wildly concocted imagination as this sci-fi thriller, but it also has brains.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>When I saw a &quot;making-of&quot; segment concerning this movie, one of the stunt men gushed about how there just aren't enough jobs for amputee  stuntmen in Hollywood and this movie has put pretty much all of them to  work. Do I need to say anything more about the violence?<p>Verhoeven  apparently liked the Heinlein book enough to make the movie but since  Heinlein wanted to be in the U.S. military and Verhoeven spent his youth in  a Nazi occupied country, their takes on the military's ability to solve all  the world's problems are a little different.<p>Basically this movie is a  different entity altogether. He throws in a love story or two, a lot of  cynicism and Doogie Howser in an SS uniform. The 90210 crowd is on screen  forever, but thankfully most of them are hacked to bits before the end of  the movie, something that never happened on 90210 sadly.<p>Great looking  bugs, action sequences that just keep going and a nasty perspective make  this into one of the best evil movies to come along in a long time. Think  Robocop but without the restraint.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Some book-to-movie adaptations are well-executed. I can't say this is one of them. I saw this movie a long time ago, and read Robert A. Heinlein's 'Starship Troopers' later, and the book is SO much better than the movie! The book discusses a lot of philosophy - child-rearing, patriotism, military attitudes, citizenship, war, etc. It really is an awesome book, and I highly recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />The movie is lacking in the genius of the book. Bit of trivia - while in the movie Dizzy was a girl, in the book, Dizzy was actually a man, a minor character who died fairly early on in the book. The film is more about adventure and special effects, the story itself doesn't have much substance. Seriously, read the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Director Paul Verhoeven freely admits that he didn't read Starship Troopers, and I doubt that screenwriter Edward Neumeier read it, either. Verhoeven read the first few chapters, but couldn't bear it. The message of the book is that military service is a duty that you owe to society. If we aren't willing to fight for our freedom, then we don't deserve it. Military discipline is praised in Heinlein's book as an almost sacred rite of passage. Verhoeven's childhood experiences during and immediately following the Second World War, first the German occupation and then the American occupation, gave him a vastly different take on the military and the Nazi propaganda Hitler used to get soldiers to enlist.<br /><br />He wanted to make a different movie, and he did. I know that Robert A. Heinlein fans were disappointed, but perhaps someone will make his 1961 novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, into a movie someday. Looking at the films that have been made of Heinlein's books we have The Puppet Masters, made into a movie with that title in 1997, and it was also made into a movie called The Brain Eaters in 1958. Then there is 1953's Project Moonbase and Destination: Moon, made in 1950. Phillip K. Dick has had Total Recall (also directed by Verhoeven), Blade Runner, Minority Report, and A Scanner Darkly, made into films, but have they ever captured the author, in all his various levels of humor, philosophy, and so forth, on the screen? Only A Scanner Darkly comes close to what Phillip K. Dick is capable of, and that film was no raging success. Blade Runner is an excellent film, but it is not Do Aliens Dream of Electric Sheep? (the book Phillip Kindred Dick actually wrote).<br /><br />I think that fans of Heinlein, especially young children, would be disturbed by the sex and violence seen onscreen in Starship Troopers. Bodies hacked to pieces by giant alien bugs, wholesale carnage, brains sucked out -- not to mention the nudity. Did you know that in the future, the infantry will be co-ed, even in the showers (on a dare from Dina Meyer Director Paul Verhoeven and cinematographer Jost Vacano shot one take of the co-ed shower scene in the nude themselves)? Perhaps a co-ed infantry is not such a bad idea after all:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Jean Rasczak: You got 10 minutes to get ready and go.<br />Johnny Rico: Yes sir.<br />Jean Rasczak: Who's in there with you?<br />Dizzy: Flores, sir.<br />Jean Rasczak: Make it 20.<br />Johnny Rico: We can do it.<br />================================<br /><br />Verhoeven chose to do a parody that isn't going to make any Heinlein fans happy, but let's just judge the film on its own merits or lack thereof. The film has a distinctive look, kind of retro, but futuristic. It is like the pulp science fiction look of what people back in the 50's imagined the future would be, way back in the 20th Century. Throw in some Nazi style uniforms, some Cholo suspenders, and voila! A campy fascist fashion fest.<br /><br />The actors and actresses might be graduates of the Beverly Hills 90210 School of Acting, but they look fantastic. Casper Van Dien, especially looks like he would be right at home in a Goebbels produced, Leni Riefenstahl directed propaganda epic. He was born too late, as somehow, he can't break out of the television ghetto into film. You'd think that Starship Troopers would be his big break, but the critics just want to use him as their whipping boy.<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Newsreel announcer: Join the Mobile Infantry and save the Galaxy. Service guarantees citizenship. Would you like to know more?<br />=====================================<br /><br />Denise Richards won the Worst Supporting Actress Razzie Award for the 1999 film The World is Not Enough. She may not be the greatest actress since Bernhardt, but she plays one on television. She has appeared in "Spin City," "Friends," "Seinfeld," "The Ben Stiller Show," "Beverly Hills, 90210," "Doogie Howser, M.D.," "Married with Children," "Melrose Place," and "Saved by the Bell." Her acting style is a perfect fit for ST, the only part I had trouble with was believing she had a math score of 97% and got into flight school.<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Zander: Don't exceed port speed.<br />Carmen: Or what?<br />Zander: Or they revoke your flight status... and mine.<br />Carmen: [Smiles] Your career is in my hands.<br />===========================================<br /><br />Neil Patrick Harris, on the other hand, makes a great smarty pants. After all, as Doogie Howser, M.D., he was already a doctor as a little kid. He currently rules television as Barney on "How I Met Your Mother," but his film resume is rather light, with only the Harold & Kumar franchise willing to give him a tumble. In ST he is not only a brain, but he has psychic ability as well. He goes right into Officer Training, as the military can always use a psychic friend.<br /><br />The military can also use a High School Teacher, as Mr. Rasczak (Michael Ironside), the one armed history teacher, turns up as Lieutenant Rasczak, a gung ho officer with a bionic hand. He is tough on his men, but only because war is hell. He works hard, but he plays hard:<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Jean Rasczak: I expect the best and I give the best. Here's the beer. Here's the entertainment. Now have fun. That's an order!<br />===================================<br /><br />Though the soldiers of the Mobile Infantry fight and play hard, they have terrible strategy, fighting the alien bugs on their own turf as if there was no such thing as air support. The story doesn't make a lot of sense, but is driven more by visceral needs than by logic. For instance, though hundreds, thousands, have died in battle, they have a military funeral for just one soldier. Not even Lieutenant Rasczak is afforded that dignity. Earlier, back in boot camp the drill sergeant demonstrates the usefulness of knives in combat by pinning the recruit's hand to the wall with his knife. Later, Ace, the recruit, plays fiddle at the post battle hoe down. His hand is miraculously healed. Hey, it's Jake Busey, son of Gary Busey. He actually learned how to play the violin for this part.<br /><br />The start of ST is like some kind of bizarre John Hughes (BTW, R.I.P., Mr. Hughes) High School epic, complete with the Big Game and the Prom. Then, when Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) enlists to impress Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) it morphs into the boot camp from Full Metal Jacket. Finally, there are the big battle scenes with the alien insects. I think that the special effects, by Industrial Light and Magic, were excellent.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven makes bold and visceral films, and he is either very brave, or else he doesn't have any shame or care what people think. He was the only director who ever showed up personally to receive his Razzie Awards, and he got two of those, for Showgirl, Worst Director AND Worst Picture. I think he was at his best/worst (so bad it's good) with the Joe Eszterhas penned Basic Instinct, but Show Girls (also from the house of Eszterhas) is so relentlessly bad that you can't help but stare dumbfounded, with your jaw dropped right to the floor in disbelief. Does anyone besides me remember Spetters? Robocop, I hear, is pretty good, but I can't take Total Recall, as it was just a desecration of the book by Phillip K. Dick. Robert A. Heinlein fans, I know how you feel.<br /><br />--------------------<br />Johnny Rico: These are the rules. Everybody fights, nobody quits. If you don't do your job I'll kill you myself.

This was a mixture of fantasy and science fiction in a very good way. I am a fan of Casper Van Dien and he is cast very well in this role. It was a bonus that we did get to see his bare tush. I did like the special effects of this movie and the sub story that was also included in this movie. I am not going to compare it to the book and I do think it is wrong to compare a movie to the book anyway. Every artist has a different concept of what the "scenary and story" should be and how it should be presented. I thought that this was a different story to it's genre and for it's time, it did an excellent job at that. I do recommend anyone seeing this movie that is a science fiction fan or wants to see something a little different.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>Paul Verhoeven has become a very successful sci-fi film director after he moved to America. "Robocop" (1987), "Total Recall" (1990), "Starship Troopers" (1997) and "The Hollow Man" (2000) are there to testify this.<br /><br />The present film is not "just" a sci-fi movie, even if it is a very good one for the genre and sci-fi lovers will enjoy it very much (as I did).<br />The approach chosen by Verhoeven is that of a caricature of an authoritarian Human society fighting an annihilation war against Bugs.<br />Aren't Bugs the perfect Enemy? YES, they may be exterminated, desecrated, demonized, whatever WITHOUT remorse.<br />But the not na?ve viewer will bear in mind that in every major armed conflict  the "enemy" will be metamorphosed little by little into a Bug.<br />At the same time the Human's military wardrobe is highly reminiscent of nazi uniforms.<br /><br />I have read Heinlein's book but I will not compare the text with the movie. After reviewing movies for a while, is my conviction that they are a "kind" of art products that should stand by themselves, detached from their literary origin.<br /><br />Aside from Verhoeven's approach, this is a very good sci-fi action film with great special effects and relentless rhythm.<br />The cast delivers fairly good acting pieces. Actors: Casper Van Dien as Rico, Neil P. Harris as Jenkins, Clancy Brown as Sergeant Zim (over par), Jake Busey as Levy and Michael Ironside as a perfect Lt. Rasczak.<br />Actress: Dina Mayer as Dizzy Flores very dynamic, athletic & sensual at the same time; Denise Richards as Carmen Ibanez is just lovely.<br />In supporting roles many good parts are delivered also.<br /><br />Jost Vacano is the usual filmography director that collaborates with Verhoeven and they team well.<br /><br />It is a good yet violent film. Sci-fi fans shouldn't miss it!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>So says Paul Verhoeven, who has said (and says again in the commentary on this DVD release) that it's one of the statements made by this morally complex film.<br /><br />I love listening to Verhoeven's commentaries (especially the one he does with Arnold Schwarzenegger on _Total Recall_). Here he shares the task with screenwriter Ed Neumeier, and putting the two of them together was an excellent choice. The commentary is one of the best features of the special edition.<br /><br />The film itself is hard to evaluate. Because it's Verhoeven, it's got sex, gore, and social satire. What it's also got -- and something that was arguably missing from the Robert A. Heinlein novel on which the film is based -- is a high level of moral complexity that doesn't divide everyone neatly into Good Guys and Bad Guys.<br /><br />The effect is odd, and oddly disturbing. On one hand, the film succeeds quite well as a combat shoot-'em-up in the style of the great World War II films. At that level, if we like, we can take the 'bugs' of Klendathu, playing as they do into our 'natural' loathing of insects, as a politically correct version of the sort of enemy Heinlein probably intended. (As long as we don't take the film's incompetent 'military action' too seriously.)<br /><br />On the other hand, the film also contains lots of sly references to the Third Reich, lots of little clues that suggest the 'bugs' didn't start the war, and lots of opportunities for the characters _and_ the audience to conclude that war may not be the best way to approach the problem here at issue.<br /><br />Okay, this latter stuff is a huge departure from Heinlein's novel, which was primarily focused on what makes military folks tick and what it means to be a responsible citizen. Heinlein's civics lesson is duly incorporated into the film, of course: a 'citizen' is one who takes personal responsibility for the safety and well-being of the body politic. But the film doesn't stop there.<br /><br />In fact, it incorporates elements that could have come from two other SF novels that have been read as responses to _Starship Troopers_, namely, Joe Haldeman's _The Forever War_ and Orson Scott Card's _Ender's Game_. I don't _know_ that Neumeier had either of these novels in mind, but there's an important reference to Mormons in the screenplay that in this context might suggest Card. Be that as it may, Heinlein's civics lesson is here subjected to severe scrutiny and even dark satire.<br /><br />That's okay by me. I regard _Starship Troopers_ as one of RAH's better novels (and as a success in its exploration of the military-man-coming-of-age mindset; I can see why military readers like it so well). Nevertheless there are problems with it that a straightforward screen adaptation wouldn't have been able to address. Neumeier and Verhoeven address those problems precisely by exaggerating them and sometimes openly ridiculing them -- while still managing to remain sensitive to the integrity of the military outlook.<br /><br />Such nuance may unfortunately be lost on much of the film's audience. Heinlein fans may either disapprove of Verhoeven's approach or miss it altogether; viewers who haven't read their Heinlein may not even be aware that there's an argument going on (and mistake this gorefest for nothing more than an earlier version of _Independence Day_).<br /><br />That's too bad, because this well-scripted, special-effects-laden film is a cinematic triumph on several levels -- only one of which is the gut-wrenching battle between humans and bugs. Verhoeven has long been clear that this film is _not_ an endorsement of either war itself or the fascistic society it tends to promote; that this isn't just obvious is a testament to Verhoeven's subtlety and, indeed, his _refusal_ to engage in 'propaganda' of the sort he satirizes.<br /><br />It's an odd film in the sense that, in order to like it properly, you have to dislike it. If you enjoy it too much, you're missing the point its director wanted it to make.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Great special effects and lots of bloody action.<br />*Fun cast of characters, even if they are a little adolescent.  Strong focus on relationships.<br />*Lots of funny but bleak satire (in true Paul Verhoven style!).  Similar to "RoboCop".<br />*Fascinating view of future society.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very gross; not for the squeamish.<br />*Themes are a little ambiguous.<br />*Altogether, a little corny and adolescent.<br /><br />This film definately entertains with its cool spaceships, alien bugs, and graphic war scenes.  With a cast of characters who seem childish, and with the director's bizzare style, the film seems very odd, extreme, and phony in a lot of places.  I'm also not sure what the film's message is supposed to be.  But whatever the case, it is enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>This is an awesome film full of dazzling (and grotesque) visual effects and great and funny characters!

Starship Troopers, is a modern, 50's genre sci-fi classic. The sound and visual FX are a marvel and the movie does manage to capture the magic of the "creature features" of old. High tech "big bugs" are out to destroy earth and its a galaxy spanning battle to save mankind. Great fun.<br />I dont know what this is pictured with my review but my review deals with the original movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>STARSHIP TROOPERS is both brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick. The concept behind it and what you get on the screen is a perfect parody of infamous WWII propaganda films. TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized, jingoistic humans for senseless violence without conscience, comicly using a war of humans versus mindless, souless, agressive "bugs" to make the point. In the top 20 best sci-fi films ever and a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>The story may seem so-so to those who take it too seriously.  If you consider it an action-comedy, it is pretty good.  On the DVD, when you add in the special effects, it makes it a five star (must-have).</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Starship Troopers is a big budget action film set in a science-fiction based future where most of society is military based, and to be considered a citizen you must serve in the Terran Mobile Infantry.  This is of course based on the classic sci-fi/military novel written by Robert A. Heinlein nearly fifty years ago, which was under the same name.  The name is pretty much where the similarities between the movie and the book end.<br /><br />The plot to this film adaptation of this sci-fi classic is not handled very respectfully, Director Paul Verhoeven's sense of satire coming across as being very out of place when I first saw the film.  I was wondering if whoever owned the rights to the book knew what they were doing to the material, because I'm sure Heinlein would NOT have approved of the end result.<br /><br />I've come to accept the satirical aspects of this film, but I don't understand why they'd mock the book, as opposed to making it into an actual movie.  I get laughs out of this movie, the action is fun, though simplistic, but as an adaptation of the novel it fails on multiple levels.  I put the novel down feeling it was one of the best books I'd ever read.  When I left this film it felt like I did after every B-action film you see on an average basis; just nothing that left an impact on me like the book did.<br /><br />Total Recall and RoboCop were both handled better in regards to mixing action, sci-fi, and satire.  Starship Troopers tries hard to be those films, but ultimately fails.  Even if it wasn't supposed to be an adaptation of that novel, it still doesn't have the charm of those previous Verhoeven films.  They made us laugh at the depictions of society, as well as draw us in with engaging characters.  You don't care about any of the characters here, because they're all cardboard cut-outs and clich&eacute;s, not worth anyone's time.  Out of all the movies disappointed me, this one is up there as one of my biggest let-downs.<br /><br />I really have nothing much left to say, other than I was incredibly disappointed by Verhoeven, and the production team for not providing a better film.<br /><br />6/10 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>The soldiers of the future will be stupid, sexy and totally expendable. Remind me to leave a note to my great grandchildren telling them not to sign up for military service!<br /><br />The film is VERY loosely based on R. Heinlein's classic novel and borrows only the barest elements of its plot. P. Verhoeven's soldiers are kids right out of highschool: niave, petulant and easily swayed by lofty speeches about honor and duty. That, and they are full of blood and internal organs that are just begging to be splattered all over the place.<br /><br />The movie's fun is in the preposterously gruesome battle scenes between hordes of alien 'Bugs' and the tiny, poorly trained pin-cushions otherwise known as Humans. The troopers move from planet to planet, hand delivering nukes to the bugs while dying horribly and in large numbers themselves. All of this is not to be taken seriously, neither is the mostly superfluous love triangle between the main characters.<br /><br />Just sit back and enjoy the slaughter, boobies (if that's your cup 'o tea), and sly social commentary. Higher level brain functions are not required, but will reveal some added depth. Dolby 5.1 audio is available, but extra features are limited to director commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Starship Troopers could honestly use a few more likeable characters and a more convincing lead, but otherwise, this is as thrilling as movies come, a lightning-paced, hilarious rollercoaster ride of bullets, explosions, gore, raucous humor, and gratuitous nudity.  So yes, this is my kind of film, and I relished every minute of it.<p>Troopers is set sometime in the unnamed future, where South American society is apparently dominated by white, blandly attractive teens with Spanish last names, but look and sound distinctly American.  The whole things plays like a big satire on fasicism, as these teens graduate from high school and sign up as citizens.  Unlucky for them, signing up is almost a guaranteed death warrant, now that the humans have declared war on the Klendathu aliens from a distant star system, giant insectoid creatures that apparently feast on human flesh (once the soldiers get there, that is).  Thus, the movie chronicles the adventures of one such platoon, led by Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), who's assisted by pals Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) and Ace Levy (Jake Busey).  Massive chaos ensues.<p>A lot of people I know see this as a stupid movie.  An equally large amount of other people I know see this as a brilliant satire.  Both can nitpick or examine whatever stupidities or issues they want, I merely see this as a remarkable thrill ride.  On a pure popcorn level, Starship Troopers is easily one of the best sci-fi action films of the 90's (perhaps behind only Jurassic Park and Star Trek: First Contact), so deft as it is at blending action and comedy.<p>Oh, yes, Starship Troopers is a very funny movie, for all the right reasons, too.  The first hour is relatively sparse in action (actually, virtually none at all unless you count that over-the-top football game), but it's more than made up for by the first-rate humor.  Definitely the standout segment must be the training camp scenes, which manages to outdo Full Metal Jacket when it comes to sheer brutality and certainly surpasses it in dark, morbid humor.<p>The first half also nicely plays the introduction of our lead characters, some of whom make an impression and a lot of whom don't.  Casper Van Dien, the vapid, lantern-jawed actor that he is, is most certainly not a good actor, and while I could have gone with a more convincing lead, at least he does well during the action sequences.  Denise Richards is equally vapid as one-half of his love interest.  Faring far better is Dina Meyer, who's kick-... turn as Dizzy is a lot of fun.  Too bad she exits the film too early.  The adult cast is fun, too, especially Clancy Brown as the sadistic, yet caring Drill Sergeant Zim.<p>But Starship Troopers ultimately succeeds because of its action, and what magnificent action it is.  The second hour is like strapping yourself into a rollercoaster.  We're treated to harrowing, Zulu-style battle sequences in which our heroes are surrounded at all sides from ferocious, unstoppable enemies.  The action is blistering, bloody, and appropriately over-the-top.  It's from Paul Verhoeven, would you expect any different?  <p>Starship Troopers succeeds because it's great fun, boosted by awesome special effects and a great score from Basil Poledouris.  I'd sure love to see a sequel, but judging from the box office take, such an option may never see the light of day.  Still, a must see for action fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A7PBI5HADJYER.html">A7PBI5HADJYER</a><br/><p>Supremely entertaining sci-fi action film takes place in the future, where Earth lives in a basic fascist society, and is at war with giant insects from a distant planet.  It's up to Casper Van Dien and company to blow as many of them away as possible.  A hilarious "character" piece in the first half gives way to non-stop action and big, bloody battle scenes in the last hour, some of the best I've ever seen.  Silly, but also exciting, energetic, and just unbelievably entertaining this is director Paul Verhoeven at his best, with standout performances from Clancy Brown and Dina Meyer. Very enthusiastically recommended.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>This film pushes the style of Robocop, one of the director's earlier movies, into the realm of full-blown black comedy and satire.  If you've ever wondered whether Americans are brainwashed by propaganda, this film offers a chilling answer.  I'm not sure why humans are so susceptable to patriotic blather, and why they can be so easily convinced that someone is their enemy, but this film does a good job of letting you recognize such tendencies in yourself.  It doesn't matter who started the war, why the war was started, or how it will end.  Once we're in a war, we are extraordinarily susceptable to the suggestion that we are right and just--and that the ends justify the means.  And as you watch the "brain" creature get prepared for experimental surgery, a number of chilling analogies come to mind.  No doubt, we as a species are more than capable of horrific brutality portrayed in this film.  It is "The Will to Power" for the Twentieth (and now Twenty-First) Century.  Entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>This was initially a successful science fiction novel written by a veteran of the Pacific Campaign during the second world war. It was part an action adventure with parallels to the  Guadacanal Campaign and also a political tract. The political ideas in the book were something which upset leftist commentators. Effectively they involved absolute unquestioning obedience by military personnel and a notion that government should only be run by people who had served in the armed forces. Ironically these values of course brought Japan to the brink of oblivion. <p>The film is rather unusual in a number of ways. The book was largely concerned with portraying a future society so that most of the narrative involved was the main characters training and his conflict with his parents. The war itself was very high tech and the enemy a race of insects also shared the sort of technology used by humans. <p>The film is sort of satirical in a strange way. It approaches the values of the future society in a sceptical way. The heroes wear Nazi uniforms and the experiments carried out on the aliens are inhuman. News reports are used to convey information and they resemble those of a totalitarian government. Critics have cottoned on and some of them have suggested that the film raises the question about who are the baddies as if it was some massive insight. <p>The other strange thing is that the alien enemy is shown to have no technology at all. Their troops do not have weapons and they move about the starts by flinging eggs to distant planets. All this makes no sense at all. One of the scenes in the film recounts how a large city on the earth was destroyed by the aliens pushing a meteor into a collision path with earth. However if there was no technology how would they know where earth was let alone push large boulders in that direction. The reality is probably that it would have been difficult to animate the aliens so that they could carry weapons so that the plot of the book was altered accordingly.<p>Despite the plot holes, the improbabilities and the question marks about whether you are barracking for the new Reich, the film is in its own way entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>I've read the book &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and its one of my favorite novels. I actually brought a copy of it with me when I saw this movie in theaters...and as the ending credits appeared I turned to the book and personally apologized to Robert Heinlein for it.<p>The movie distorts things from the book and is about as faithful as James Mason's &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth.&quot; In the novel you didn't have to join the military to earn citizenship, Dizzy was a guy and died in the first ten pages, and other facts I could go on about.<p>Of course, even if it weren't based off a book, its still a bad movie. The mobile infantry isn't very mobile, the equipment consists of cheap plastic armor and a t-shirt, and the inter-gender shower scene seems thrown in just so the advertisers could say, &quot;Hey! We have nudity!&quot; Not to mention the romance is unnecessary, unromantic, uninteresting, and seems just thrown in there. Hell, if Johnny (who wasn't white in the novel...) likes his girlfriend so much, why does he cheat with Dizzy? Poor character development.<p>The only likeable character is Sgt. Zim. Thats probably because the man who played Sgt. Zim was one of the only cast members who actually read the book. Reading an interview with him, I realized he must have known more about the book than the producers and director combined.<p>Starship Troopers could have been made into a great movie. Sadly, this is not it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>"Starship Troopers," directed by Paul Verhoeven, is based on the novel of the same title by Robert Heinlein. While the film differs to a significant degree from the book, I find Verhoeven's version to be a thoroughly exciting and enjoyable piece of science fiction adventure.<p>"Troopers" takes place in a future in which humanity is waging an interplanetary war against an extraterrestrial collective of insectoid creatures. The film focuses on the personal journey of Johnny Rico (played by Casper Van Dien). We follow him from high school graduation to enlistment in the space infantry to combat against Earth's alien enemies. So "Troopers" is as much coming-of-age film as sci-fi adventure.<p>"Troopers" works well as a straightforward sci-fi adventure, but the filmmakers have also woven a lot of satirical material into the film. The result is a film with an odd vibe: should we be more fearful of the "bug" aliens or of Earth's own government? Incorporated into the story are bits of futuristic newscasts and propaganda.<p>Van Dien and the superb supporting cast play their roles with sincerity and enthusiasm, so regardless of the film's satiric thrust, the viewers wind up with heroes whom we can really cheer for. There is a great chemistry among the youthful ensemble of troopers, and tough guy Michael Ironside has a fine role as an older mentor figure.<p>The special effects and action sequences are top notch; the filmmakers have shown an amazing attention to detail in realizing this future world. The insectoid aliens, who come in a variety of forms, are very impressive. The whole thing is presented with great visual flair, and is superbly complemented by Basil Poledouris' thrillingly bombastic musical score. And while the outrageous gore and violence of some sequences may be too much for some viewers, I found this material to be well integrated into the overall cinematic vision. "Starship Troopers" is a sci-fi epic that definitely packs a punch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Paul Verhoeven's movies are usually described by me as movies that are easy to hate. While Robocop was great, I didn't enjoy Total Recall all that much and Basic Instinct is basically a movie you shouldn't like but for some reason it draws you in(it's probably because of clothesless Sharon Stone). Less said about Showgirls too, the better. He followed that awful movie with this one, which despite not making back it's budget, it has an odd cult following at times with people loving it's fascism parodys and its almost endless gore. It's very campy at times but also it's got some great action scenes and some very nifty visual effects.<br /><br />It's many years in the future and people get to enlist in the Army and do service and they get guaranteed citizenship instead of being civilians(I never caught the difference). 3 friends: Johnny, Carl and Carmen join up, each joining different divisions. Johnny's in the mobile infantry unit, who gets to be up close and personal with huge insects, dodging flying body parts in the process.<br /><br />In the commentary, star Casper Van Dien says the film should've won over Titanic. True, in looking at Titanic there is a couple of odd looking shots but it was really technically impressive. This film is also wow-inducing too, especially the Zulu inspired shot with probably hundreds of bugs in the same shot. Some of the space shots during battles looking kind of odd but the bugs are very impressive, my favorite being these flying "hoppers".<br /><br />Keep in mind adults: this film is really violent. Heads get knocked off, bodies cut in two, legs, arms, women aren't spared either. It doesn't get in the way of the action scenes which are very exciting and visually impressive. One of my favorite bugs is these things that, I don't know how to describe it but they s**t this plasma out into the air, smacking into ships and causing damage. Too bad they're not in here much. And since this is Verhoeven you get a big shower scene with lots of T&A.<br /><br />The campy parts come in it's broadcasts where the film will act like a commercial at parts, giving you information on battle strategies and the government's plan on defeating the bugs. It's hard not to miss the message, like where soldiers show kids guns and show how to aim. Subtlety isn't exactly Paul's strong suit but the message comes through. The "would you like to know more?" still gets me chuckling when it comes on.<br /><br />It's a film that you'll absolutely love it, or simply won't get it. Some will probably just love the action scenes, others think it's too violent. To me, it's a great romp that's finally for adults to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on Robert Heinlein's 1959 classic science fiction novel of the same name.<br /><br />The movie begins with an advertisement from the "Federal [Military] Network" where young people are encouraged to join the military "to become a citizen." (A citizen as opposed to a civilian is a military person.)  We are also shown how the Earth can defend itself against "the arachnoid [or bug] threat."  (Yes, the aliens threatening to destroy Earth in this futuristic sci-fi movie are giant bugs and they live on a bug planet.)<br /><br />Then the story switches to the four young people who have made the decision to join the military during peacetime:  (1) Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), (2) Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards, the ex-Mrs. Charlie Sheen), (3)  Dizzy  "Diz" Flores (Dina Meyer), and (4) Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris).  Johnny's decision is heavily based on what Jean Rasczak (Michael Ironside) tells him.<br /><br />Eventually full-scale war with the bugs ensues.  During this part of the movie (which mainly follows the exploits of Johnny) there are intense, graphic action sequences (thus this movie is definitely not for children).  The special effects are spectacular as well.<br /><br />If this movie was only about what I said above, I certainly would not give it the rating I did.  But the movie is more.  It is actually a not-so-obvious, comical satire of fascist propaganda with an emphasis against military conformity and a warning of the sickening realities of war.  (Fascism is a system of government characterized by one-party dictatorship, private economic enterprise under central government control, racism, militarism, etc.)  However, like I said, this is not obvious and I suspect that many people will only see this movie as humans fighting giant bugs.  (In fact, this would explain the one- and two-star ratings below this one as these people saw the movie on its most obvious level.)  You have to watch this movie carefully and not let the dazzling effects distract you.<br /><br />All the actors, contrary to what other reviewers say below, do a good job in their roles especially with respect to the comical aspects of this movie.  (I suspect that there were many retakes as some of the actors probably cracked up laughing.)  I have to give special kudos to Michael Ironside as the determined Lieutenant Rasczak for an exceptional fine acting job.  ("Rasczak" means "bastard" in Tchzekkian.)<br /><br />Finally, the special edition DVD is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a unique movie that has to be closely viewed in order to be fully appreciated.  As such, I feel that it is a movie not to be missed!!<br /><br />(1997;  2 hr 10 min;  2 discs;  widescreen)<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>There is so much going on in this film.  One viewing will not be enough.  This is my absolute favorite science fiction film ever made with Aliens coming in at a close second.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>Many punters watching Starship Troopers will miss Verhoeven's point. Rather than being a slightly post sell-by date space action flick, it's a spoof in the tradition of Zucker &amp; Abrahams, although the slapstick is very deeply submerged in good old fashioned sci-fi hokum: Planet earth faces a barrage of asteroids being flung at it through hyperspace from a species of arachnids inhabiting a planet the far side of the galaxy, but the humans refuse to conceive that the bugs might be sentient, and (repeatedly) get a good pasting when they arrive to teach the bugs a lesson. The funniest scene is when a starship commander suddenly cottons on that the beams of destructive plasma which keep obliterating her squadron are being deliberately aimed and aren't just random! <p>Along the way we meet a set of bluntly-drawn, wafer-thin  characters who have been sucked into enlisting into the infantry by the propaganda of Verhoeven's trademark all-intrusive Government, who get put through the mill in a terrific send up of the traditional Hollywood boot-camp.<p>The characters are too thin, though, and the film doesn't really work on any level except as a spoof, because you can't identify with - or like - them. Verhoeven toys with the idea of a love triangle, but even he can't be bothered drawing it out, and rather suddenly gives up on it half-way through.<p>Not a bad way to spend a rainy evening, but not likely to go down in the Motion Picture Hall of Fame either.<p>Nice special effects, though.</p></br><a href="../users/ANOAF9M5MTJHN.html">ANOAF9M5MTJHN</a><br/><p>great movie i dont no were the people brains are who give this below four star must dumber than dumb</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Even after a decade and a half, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAFDP2">Starship Troopers</a> is still exciting and entertaining. The plot portrays a future in which a militarized planet earth is fighting against a race of alien bugs. Simple enough - and actually not unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens</a>. For an action flick, the characters are surprisingly likable and really grow on you. However, what makes this movie worth watching even now is its element of satire. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAFDP2">Starship Troopers</a> parodies the senseless violence of war and the effect it has on society. The troops are all good looking (particularly Denise Richards!) and the officers are dressed like Nazis. Best of all, throughout the film, the narration employs a series of 1930s-style newsreels with propaganda clips and infomercials. It's a great study in contrasts. Of course, it's not really clear why they don't just rely on aerial bombardments and nukes (after all, the U.S. does) but I guess that wouldn't make for a good movie.

Yeah, I've seen Starship Troopers lots of times. It is a unique story with great characters and well produced. This is a really fun sci-fi movie to watch. Great special effects and a nice future look. As always, my only complaint is why send ground troops with under-powered weapons to attack the "bugs" without air support? Oh, well.

It is a war film.  Unfortunately the writers do not know war and combat.<br /><br />Humans are spreading through the galaxy.  Intelligent insects are also spreading through the galaxy.  Where the two meet there is usually bloodshed and slaughter.  Then actual war breaks out when the bugs send an attack against Earth.  The movie follows the careers of three young people who have signed up with the military right out of school.  The occupy positions in the infantry, fleet, and intelligence (although there seems to be little intelligence used).<br /><br />The movie is a little confused as it is part commercial and part film.  It is like the whole thing is a recruitment film (except for all of the death).  The military tactics are utterly stupid.  For instance, when you land on a planet of bugs that crawl, swarm, hop and fly, be sure to use open-air enclosures to ensure the lowest possible safety levels.  The bugs themselves are also contradictory.  Throughout most of the film we will see five or six soldier pour hundreds of rounds of automatic fire into a bug before it collapses.  Later, a single soldier starts picking off bugs with single shots (yeah, right).<br /><br />But still, in the end it is a fun film but you just can't think too much about the details (like the asteroid big enough to effect the gravity on a glass of water, but on nothing else in the ship).  For outright action this one is hard to beat and action films really aren't known for keeping details straight anyway, so enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>This movie is a hoot!!! It is also probably THE greatest reason to buy into the blu ray system. I needed a shower after watching this movie because I actually felt like I had been knee deep in giant bug guts for 2+ hours when it was over. GREAT EXPERIENCE that could only be experienced with Blu Ray!!<br />There are a lot of other movies that you will just plain miss out on way too much without the superior video and audio quality of Blu Ray. If you dont believe me, check out a system with this movie then watch the same movie on standard DVD......night and day difference!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I have seen Starship Troopers as well as reading the book by Robert Heinlein, and unlike those who might tell you not to waste your money if you've already read the book, I would actually recommend that course of action.  Why, you might ask?  One reason I recommend this movie is because of what it did for me--it led me to buy the book.  I had heard Heinlein's name mentioned in connection with other s/f series before, but until seeing Starship Troopers on VHS I had never felt any urge to actually sit down and read his works.<p>Another reason I recommend this movie is because I find it fascinating on several levels: 1) As a special effects-laden extravaganza; 2) As a satirical adaptation of a sci-fi master's work; and 3) As just an enjoyable, mindless fluff-fest.  Somehow Paul Verhoeven managed to work all three elements into one movie, a nearly impossible task in the world of moviemaking, and he carries it off brilliantly.  For those who have read the book and found themselves not liking the movie, I would definitely recommend watching it as a mindless fluff-fest.  You'll enjoy it much better that way.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>While some say the storyline is cheesy and the acting bland, what remains is that Starship Troopers is one hell of an action thrill ride.  Based on the controversial book, Starship Troopers tells the story of a young man named Johnny Rico who joins the military so he can become a "citizen".  In fact, all of the new recruits are all real young men and women, but what they don't know is the horrors that await them.  Director Paul Verhoeven's patented penchant for graphic violence (see his other films Robocop and Total Recall if you wanna see what I mean) is in full effect here, human soldiers are dismembered in full gorey glory here, and the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a movie (and this was made in 1997).  But behind the excellent special effects and gut churning gore, there is an underlying theme leftover from the novel, the horrors of war and the loss of innocence when youngsters must endure it.  The ensemble cast includes Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey, Michael Ironside, Clancy Brown, Neal Patrick Harris, and Patrick Muldoon.  Highly recommended to any fan of sci-fi or action in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>Really enjoy the send up of the military mind-set and the concept of service guarantees Citizenship (if you survive).

I have not read Heinlein's book yet, this review is  based solely on the movie.  In its campy format you will find humor and entertainment in what can only be described as a dismal futuristic setting!  Dazzling performances by Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and the alluringly gorgeous Dina Meyer!  Starship Troopers is a big movie that I have watched and enjoyed over and over again.  The director and producers did an outstanding job in making this film and its "bugs" exceptionally realistic.  Keep in mind that due to its brutal realism, this film is not for the faint of heart or the extremely young viewers.<p>The premise:  MINOR SPOILER<p>Picture a futuristic setting where the "problems" of democracy have been erased and one world government has been established, in effect, removing all of the borders and citizenship is earned through federal service.  We're introduced to the main characters that are in their last days of high school and preparing to enter federal service to earn their citizenship.  Among those main characters we have Johnny Rico, Carmen Ibanez and Dizzy Flores.  In short, Johnny loves Carmen, Carmen loves herself and her future and Dizzy loves Johnny, whew!  We're taken from there to Johnny and Dizzy being in boot camp for the Mobile Infantry and Carmen in flight training.<p>Klendathu, the home world of the bugs has been making attempts to destroy Earth by flogging asteroids at it.  Unfortunately, one makes it through the defenses and destroys the love triangles home town!  Earth immediately mobilizes its forces for an attack on the Klendathu home planet, where they are subsequently massacred by a much larger force of "bugs" than they collectively expected.<p>What follows from here can be described in no other terms than outstanding science fiction, action and drama rolled into one of the best Science Fiction flicks to ever grace the Silver Screen.  If you're even a minor Sci-Fi fan this DVD is a must for your collection!<p>On side B, we're treated to some wonderful test screenings between Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards, deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, a documentary and some very enthusiastic behind the scenes footage.  {ssintrepid}</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>STARSHIP TROOPERS is high on my list of excellent sci-fi films.  Man battles Bug!  It is so rare when special effects, story, and sci-fi elements come together -- usually a film relies too much on one and is not balanced by the others.<p>TROOPERS is also a wickedly funny film.  Hats off to director Verhoeven for his twisted sense of humor.  The killings that happen during the coarse of the film are lightened by this humor.  I howled when a dead space-body bounced off a starship's cockpit window.  Verhoeven also drops in hilarious &quot;Public Service Announcements&quot; throughout the film -- my favorite features some twisted kids taking pleasure in squashing cockroaches on the pavement.  Hilarious.<p>The film does not take itself too seriously.  The actors are appropriately heroic and attractive.  It's almost like the SAVED BY THE BELL cast went into the SPACE ACADEMY!<p>The effects (LOTS of bugs killing LOTS of troopers) are very cool.

Extremely bloody, insanely hokey, this film should not in any  way be taken seriously.  Although the storyline does have some serious  elements (playing up the power of propaganda) it mostly does one thing, and  that is:  It Makes You Hate Bugs!  Put aside all the naziesque  similarities, the only over all message I got was that in any war, the  enemy is nothing but an enemy.  And it's either me or them.  It sure as  hell isn't gonna be me!  <p>The special effects were what made the movie,  it's just as good on mute as it is with the sound blaring.  Pure eye candy  fun.  The gore is probably what limited this movie's success at the box  office, but it's only a movie!  The bugs aren't real!  And my weren't those  body parts realistic!  Throw in Denise Richards and you can't go wrong!  Paul Verhoeven is definitely a misunderstood genius and this movie proves  it.  An all out testosterone/adrenaline cocktail that you'll watch again  and again.  If you haven't seen it yet just buy it, there's no point in  renting it unless you like throwing away money.

I think Starship Troopers is a great action packed movie.  I thought the movie had an interesting idea instead of blowing up a major city such as London or New York, they picked Buenos Aires. The storyline was interesting it was about a bug race trying to eliminate us. This movie released in 1997 grossed 54 million dollars and it cost 95 million to make.  This is a violent film and has sexuality in it.  It is not recommended for children.

I rate this movie at 5+ stars and hope to see the likes of it again. The scale and scope of the large screen CGI effects for huge fleets of starships looked absolutely authentic and would make any pacifist proud to witness the display of military power (at least for the duration of this film).<br /><br />I recent watched this film on my large screen HDTV for the first time. I was amazed by the color, clarity, sharpness, and good general definition. All of the great effects and action were transferred to DVD beautifully regardless of how staged (i.e., computer generated or live action). What a geat DVD transfer.  I can only imagine what this film would be like in Blue Ray.<br /><br />I really didn't know at the time I saw the movie anything about its origins and thought the political background was a simple construct assembled for the sake of the movie.  It was so simply stated that I trust most viewers didn't take it too seriously.  I don't know what the writers may have believed, but as far as the film was concerned it came on as a science fiction movie from start to finish.<br /><br />I also felt that the CGI images were enormously original on a scope which has been achieved only by a few sci-fi movies.  In addition, the basic design and computer effects for the warrior bugs were absolutely outstanding and for my money were only surpassed by Giger's vision for the Alion.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Join Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizz (Dina Meyer), Carmen (Denise Richards), Zander (Patrick Muldoon) and Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) and the rest of the gung ho Troopers in this futuristic, sci-fi, action/adventure, surreal allegorical tale of intergalactic warfare between mankind and giant bugs. The '97 film `Starship Troopers' excels in every category; special effects, action, originality, dialogue and anything else you can think of. There's nothing else like it, so "Do your part' and get the popcorn ready for the wildest ride through the galaxy one could imagine.<br /><br />Note: The film contains extreme violence and some nudity so you may not want to include any little ones in on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>Yes, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; does weave a fairly strong (and clever) anti-fascist theme into its storyline, and features some brilliant special effects, but unfortunately, it's not enough to overcome a lame script and  some of the worst acting in recent years.<p>Think of a Roger Corman flick  with $100 million in special effects and you get the idea. <p>Let's start  off with the good stuff: &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; features truly  harrowing and effective visuals - some of the best in recent years. And  director Paul Verhoeven has always been great at weaving a tale of a  moderately warped future, and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, with its'  neo-fascist ideas (check the uniforms - Gestapo all the way!) and strong  hint of genetic perfection (nobody is fat or ugly, and nobody has pimples),  does get some sly shots in at the goose stepping/master race crowd.  <p>Also, check out the terrific score by Basil Poledouris (who also did  &quot;The Hunt for Red October), with its fascist propaganda-ministry  overtones. It sounds like recruiting music for the armed forces, and works  VERY well. <p>But these strong points are countered by a weak script (best  line: &quot;This planet crawls!&quot;) and  hack performances by Casper Van  Dien and Denise Richards (not to mention Neil Patrick Harris, best known as  TV's Doogie Howser, as a supersecret government spook). Only Dina Meyer,  who plays one of Van Diem's soldier cohorts, displays any kind of depth;  she gives her character, Diz, a nice mix of toughness and  vulnerability.<p>Then there's the techno-gaffes. The producers of this film  would have us believe that mankind has mastered faster than light travel,  but can't stop meteors from hitting the earth? And why send in millions of  humans to basically uninhabitable planets when they can just blow up the  planets and the bugs with them? They can't just flood the planets with  Raid?<p>But &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; isn't about the science in  science fiction. It's a blow-em-up, and works well on that level, but with  decent actors and a better script, Verhoeven could have used his visual  inventiveness and keen satirical edge to make a far better movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Loosely based on the Heinlein novel, "Troopers" follows the weirdly lucky "Rico", a soldier in the army of the future.  In the clean world-of-tomorrow, with mankind having extended his reach across the galaxy, his only obstacle are the arachnids, a vicious insect race that seems to act mindlessly yet can travel through space by shooting spores like rockets. Lacking any technology, Arachnids can wipe out armies, bring down the mighty starships of the federation, and even launch huge asteroids at man's most heavily populated worlds. Slowly but surely, the federation realizes that the bugs aren't a mindless infestation that will allow itself to be exterminated, but a calculating enemy that must be wiped out. With their greater numbers and lower regard for any life (including their own) the bugs take the upper hand, and the only extermination that man can now envision is his very own.<br /><br />The great thing about "Star Ship Troopers" is that Director Paul Verhoeven, makes the extinction of man plausible and yet funny.  With his reach approximating an empire maintained by huge starfleets and vast armies, mankind adheres to a philosophy of "might-makes-right". With Verhoeven's signature multimedia narrative clearly illuminating a society in love with its own power, we may even wonder whether the bugs are fighting in defense against an implacable enemy that simply had it coming.<br /><br />Early on, we meet Rico in high-school, where he (and us) learns the political realities of our future - in which only a select few have the right of citizenship.  The arachnids are already a threat, but not yet an enemy when Rico graduates high school and volunteers for "Mobile Infantry".  Soon the situation changes and mankind realizes it's at war against hordes of merciless killing machines.<br /><br />"Troopers" is good, yet never becomes great.  It's fun to see Verhoeven's dark-themed future, in which mankind seems to be skating cheerily on the edge of fascism (the clothing styles, inspired by German WWII militaria, drive the point home), yet it's never quite as biting as the similar "RoboCop".  The CGI is nice, but never spectacular - the flick seems to have imagined a future looking little different than something from the 80's "Buck Rogers" show.  None of the characters stand out, and much of the action is episodic.  That said, the flick manages to toss us some surprises - like Clancy Brown as a mechanically homicidal drill instructor, and Michael Ironsides as Rico's no-nonsense boss.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>This great movie, which I always find funnier when I call it Starship Poopers, is the birth and death of young talent.  It's the moment that we get to see a young Denise Richards, nubile, perky, and smiley.  Oh yes, thank you Denise Richards.  On the other hand, it's the one and only time that Casper Van Dien (who gets a homoerotic, alien, mucus facial during a battle) has been in anything worthwhile; so, it's basically like Bloodsport for Jean Claude Van Damme.<br /><br />There is the wonderful shower scene in which male and female alike get wet and soapy, and no doubt inspired Denise Richards to do her infamous threesome scene in Wild Things.  It's also the scene that the audience gets introduced to the hot redhead, who has never been seen again.<br /><br />Alien carnage and futuristic battle scenes dominate the movie.  What's great is that the alien cockroach looking things rip apart bodies so messily that Steven Seagal gets jealous every time he watches the movie.<br /><br />Besides Richards, who steals every scene, it's a cast of B-listers who every movie-buff knows by face but not name.  It's an entire movie of, "Hey!  It's that guy!" or "Hey, it's that chick from that one movie!"  And that includes Doogie Howser.<br /><br />The greatest part of this movie is the constant voice-over that some sort of news caster works into every transition.  It's a sci-fi, action, news cast!  At every turn there is an infomercial that is so jingoistic that I initially thought it was done to make fun of Nazis.  "Would you like to know more?"  Even the kids get involved in the war effort, killing anything that resembles the bug-like aliens.<br /><br />Ruffnecks!  Rico's Ruffnecks!</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>A science-fiction pulp satire based on Robert Heinlein's (author of Farenheit 451)novel of the same title. Director Paul Verhoeven and writer Ed Neumeier present their own satirical version of the novel with spectacular and extremely graphic special effects.<br /><br />The Earth is under the governance of a fascist state in which citizenship is conditional upon proper military service: commonly accepted rights are reduced to privileges granted on the condition that one perform state-mandated duties.  Several young friends soon join the ranks to fight a mysterious race of gigantic insects who are assaulting the planet.  The new cadets join the space fleet to attack the giant pests on their home planet of Klandathau but things don't go as planned: the critters are smarter than anyone thought and put up a stiff resistance.<br /><br />The film is presented in a rather comical/cartoonish manner to emphasize the satirical themes.  Although the acting is somewhat weak with perhaps the exception of Michael Ironside as the hardened sergeant, it's the special effects that are the prize of the film.  These are truly some of the most impressive CGI effects ever presented and there's no shortage of blood and guts.  For this reason, I would not recommend this film for young children or disturbed adolescents.  The gore in this film is the most graphic I've ever seen and I'm certainly not shy to violence in films.<br /><br />A great satire/sci-fi/action film with great effects and a good plot.  Definitely a film you can enjoy over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Paul Verhoeven<p>"Starship Troopers" is a look a very different future.  Democracy has failed and the world is united under a fascist regime.  This film is not about the differences between democracy and fascism (though there is mention of this), but rather this needs to be mentioned because this is the underpinning of what sort of society we are dealing with and how it has shaped the characters.  <p>We open with a brief propaganda video (which we will see different versions of throughout the movie).  The purpose is to instill national pride in the citizens.  From here, we move into a high school setting where we meet our characters for the first time.  Johnny Rico (Casper Van Diem), Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) are about to graduate from high school and they are deciding what to do with their lives.  For various reasons, they all decide to enlist in the military (service guarantees citizenship, according to the propaganda video).  Johnny and Dizzy are infantry, Carmen is to be a pilot, and Carl goes to military intelligence.  For the first time in years, the four are separated.  Carl disappears from the movie at this point, but we do follow the other three.<p>The big war the military is fighting is that against the bugs from Klendathu.  These are nameless, faceless insects (though large and extremely dangerous).  Though Johnny and Dizzy are being trained to fight against human opponents, we know that war will come against the bugs.  And it does.  <p>While "Starship Troopers" looks like a B-Grade sci-fi movie, it is much more enjoyable than that with a bit more depth.  Even though this is more background than anything else, we get to see how a fascist society might have developed into and what sort of citizens it might have turned out.  "Starship Troopers" is also a straight up sci-fi flick with humans in a war against bugs.  The movie is a lot of fun, fast paced, and while I didn't care for it much the first time I saw, it has really grown on me.  I don't know how well Verhoeven skewers fascist regimes with satire (as what the stated intent of the film), but this film can be intelligent as well as just an action packed ride.  <p>-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>this one packs a wallop but some things are way to dumb. the aliens are top notch and way to many to kill. the battles are awesome and the cast is lively. the part where the head alien sucks the brains from his victims is gooey and fun and Casper Van Dien(Sleepy Hollow, Python), looks like he had a good old time riding that bug.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen this yet I advise that you do, but if you haven't seen a Paul Verhoven movie before I recommend that you see Robocop or Total Recall (preferably Robocop) before you see this.  Some say that this is a dull film spending too much time on the youngsters who join the Mobile Infantry to become citizens of the Federation, turning it into a soap opera in space, when it could be focusing on the action on the battlefield.  Well folks, it does both of these in a good balanced ammount.  It's even better for those who like this movie since it has a running time of 136 minutes or so, so you can just eat this up for it's long running time if you like it, or fall asleep if you don't.  We start off with Johnny Ricco, a guy just getting out of high school with his friends.  Interestingly enough they all decide to join the military to get special privelidges afterwards except for Ricco, who joins for his girlfriend, but ends up wanting revenge when his home town is destroyed by astroids sent by the arachnids, giant bugs that kill people very violently.  The Federation is the collective that controls most of what happens in the world and there are several little TV news breaks that come on to show us updates about events in the war and other things much like Robocop, which was also written by Ed Neumeier.  Once this movie takes off from the opening subjects of leaving home and meeting new people we are thrown in the violent world of epic battles directed by Paul Verhoven.  Expect to see limbs flying and people getting chopped in half left and right.  If it weren't for the nudity and extreme violence this movie could be rated PG-13.  It has a very upbeat and alot of the time comical mood, Verhoven makes his satirical films as cheesy as he can to aid the social comment by using humor, and there is some good stuff in this one.  What more can I say?  The special effects are amazing, and some of the acting isn't to great, but that's to the benefit of Verhoven's mission.  The ending of this film might seem a little abrupt, but there is a sequel (don't roll your eyes just yet!).  Let me tell you that Starhip Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation is a movie that continues the story on a differnt plain and doesn't wear out the elements.  It may be a video release but it is enjoyable.<br /><br />I recommend that everyone see this movie, but they might want to cover their kid's eyes at a few parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>It is in some ways a good film. The various ? animals ?, in that case bugs, are very well animated and very realistic. If you don't like bugs, you will get a real thrill out of it. In fact they are even funny in a way. Then the film itself is a series of borrowed elements without any deep meaning at all. You will recognize some elements from Platoon, Aliens, Star Wars, even Star Trek, and many other films. But it is very representative of a ? man-centered ? approach of the universe : aliens are necessarily hostile and they have to be destroyed. But this film tries to be a little bit more intelligent than many other militaristic films : you have to understand their intelligence to defeat them. One step further and you may come to the idea of looking for a political solution that would lead to coexistence. This film is also a good illustration of the vanity of such an approach. In a war of that type there are not one head and slaves. This is a caricature and it may lead to catastrophes. When you get into a war with a whole people, race, species, etc, this group that sees you as the enemy, and that you see as the enemy, will be moved by their survival instinct which will lead them to a high level of autonomy and creativity. You can capture or kill the leader, or even the main leaders, that will not stop the war because it is a survival war, and everyone will be under pressure to do something for the survival of the culture, the country, the regime, the religion, you name it you have it. What do you think moved the French during World War II to resists against the Germans, to the point of liberating Paris and most of the big cities ? Many reasons but with one at the core of them all : it was the only way to prevent the anihilation of the nation, to guarantee the survival of the nation. <p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Lust in space&quot; may have been a better title for this awful movie based on the book by Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein would cringe if he saw this lust story.  Because, thats what is it when you get right down to it: a lust story. There's a catfight between the two women in Johnny Rico's life (although the two girls don't fight each other in the physical sense). One girl wants to get laid by Rico before the other girl does.

Most trashy directors do.  I mean, looking at his filmography, it's hard to find a `great' film in the bunch and yet many celebrated cinephiles count films like `Basic Instinct' and `Showgirls' as two of the best films ever made.  I'm assuming they follow this logic up with the whole `so bad it's good' argument, but honestly I can't rally behind this.<br /><br />Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen, `Starship Troopers' is easily the best.<br /><br />Having read Robert Heinlein's novel while still in school, I can say that Verhoeven's adaptation isn't especially faithful, but he does pull some of the more blatant themes and uses them to propel forward the action in a way that pulls your eyes into focus.  In like Verhoeven fashion, `Starship Troopers' is at many times exploitive and does seem to have an occupancy with flesh and sexuality, and the soap operatic relationship circles does have an eye-rolling effect on viewers who are looking for a more focused action epic, but `Starship Troopers' does get a lot of things right.  The action in particular is stunning.  This is a bloody bath of alien warfare, and those bug creatures are grandiose and grotesque and totally hit every mark, and the gore factor is a huge plus for a film of this nature.<br /><br />The `hidden agenda' here is a nice touch because it adds weight to some of the more ridiculous aspects of the film.  This is essentially a satire pointed at governmental control in the guise of a mindless sci-fi epic and it does manage to make that point rather effectively, but to use that as an excuse for some of the more glaring issues the film has (the acting, the clich&eacute;s, the wasted development) is kind of lazy.  There are many `smart' satires that straddle that fine line and actually balance out the exploitive with genuine wit, and `Starship Troopers' doesn't quite get that.<br /><br />It is a fun film, sure, but it is also an easy film to criticize because it seems to relish in its own inadequacies.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>Sex, violence, nudity, big guns, war, and Denise Richards.

Based of the comments that I have heard from critics and my friends, in the decade since this film was released, this is the sort of film that you will either love or hate, although I, personally, cannot imagine how anyone could not like this film. If you love really trashy B-grade horror movies, then you will adore this film. It is essentially a B-grade movie made on an A-grade budget. This film contains gratuitous violence, sex and nudity; disturbingly large quantities of bug blood; and Denise Richards. How could that not appeal? The script is a lot smarter than you would imagine, essentially it is a satire of war propaganda films, complete with newsreels and more scenes of bravery than I've seen since John Wayne's death. It is also directed by Paul Verhoeven, the man who gave the world "Basic Instinct", who impressed me so much with this film that I am now half tempted to watch the infamous "Showgirls".</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Another in a long line of movies I didn't expect to like, but liked a lot. Starship Troopers has the feel of the best of 1950's Saturday matinee sci-fi serials, updated for the 1990's. It is an interesting movie, has a good plot, has enough action to hold almost anyone's attention (in fact I'm informed Starship Troopers has more shots fired in its run-time than any film ever made...) and is enjoyable end-to-end. As someone told me and as I put in my title up there, if you haven't seen it, you probably should.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>This movie takes one of Robert A. Heinlein's books and attempts to translate it into film. This film follows the general precept of the book that mankind is in a war with a race of insect-like creatures that have various castes. As with the book the movie does not attempt to resolve the war, but does intend on providing some hope.<br /><br />Heinlein has been called the Dean of Science Fiction. Because of his phenomenal success he was able to write beyond the boundaries of many of his contemporaries to express his viewpoints regarding society. The novel on which this movie was based was laced with several political viewpoints as well as predicting a future for the military that we can be seen as the trend of our military today.<br /><br />When Heinlein wrote this novel in 1959 he tried to convey the simple concept that citizenship in the most free society on earth was taken for granted.  Heinlein thought that perhaps one way of changing the definition of citizenship was to require that it be earned. Thus Heinlein advocated that all citizens should give two years of public service. Some people have narrowly construed this service to mean military service, but in his book Heinlein clearly stated that the service was governmental service and did not specify the type of service. In any case, earning the right to vote was central to the book. That concept was minimally discussed in the movie in favor or making an action-packed military monster movie.<br /><br />Heinlein's future military was focused on the individual, with incredible weapons and training. Interestingly, our military continues to rely on ever-better weaponry with the individual soldier wielding ever more power and hopefully having better training as time passes. Again, the movie threw out this concept in order to make the movie move faster with multiple rescue scenarios. While Heinlein's bugs were not sympathetic, by having the bugs callously destroy a chunk of Earth real estate enables the audience to loathe them even more.<br /><br />After throwing out two of Heinlein's key concepts, the result is a B science fiction movie with lots of gore and action. However, even with traditional science fiction themes, I liked this movie. The acting is only fair, much of the movie is "golly gee whiz" and salute the flag, and the plot has more holes than cheesecloth, and for all that it is a fun and exciting movie that I have watched at least four or five times. Some of the scenes are dramatic and scary, such as when the flying bugs attack and when the ground bugs spear people. The scenes with the tanker bugs are incredible.  I have spent too much time trying to figure out how their burning dissolving fluid works.<br /><br />There are places in the movie that are likely implausible, and yet, maybe not. When Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) pilots a huge spaceship out of dock she does it by eye and barely keeps from damaging the ship and the dock. Clearly not standard operating procedure and had the ship been damaged she would have been fried (or should have) by her boss. However, she is cocky and overconfident and takes responsibility and authority, all traits that we try to cultivate in our military within the framework of standard military discipline. So perhaps parts are a bit far-fetched, but maybe not too far-fetched.<br /><br />One aspect that I think Heinlein would have approved is the brutality of military training. People broke bones and suffered pain, just as they would in actual combat, though situations that cause death are clearly unacceptable. While the scenes of injury in training are initially shocking, medical technology in this future has the capability of repairing such injuries and being capable of handling the shock of seeing those injuries or withstanding them could give a soldier a combat advantage in the field; gruesome, but effective scenes.<br /><br />The film was intended to be shocking, and it succeeds. This movie is not for children. I would not let anyone under the age of 14 watch this movie, even though there are a few video games with similar levels of violence. I think the movie is too violent for even young teenagers, and it deserves its "R" rating. There are a few scenes involving nudity and one involving sex that again may be shocking, but given the equality of men and women in this army of the future, the scenes make sense.<br /><br />I have read the book and I still like the movie. This movie is not going to win any awards, but who cares? I think this is a great bowl of popcorn movie action film where you can relieve some stress as thousands of bugs are gruesomely terminated. There are times when you really want to root for the human race, and this one allows you to do so without guilt.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>With director Paul Verhoeven at the helm of a film, you never know what you're up against. As a storyteller, his sense of direction tends to be hit-or-miss; some turn out fine, while other flounder. As a director, his sense of over-the-top style and dazzling special effects provide viewers with a like-it-or-hate-it experience, even saving some of his films from failure.<p>&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is a special case, a movie so gawdy and ridiculous, so over-the-top in effects and lacking in logical plot that many who see it will be divided down the middle. For me, the movie works, due to the fact that since the story is sheer sci-fi hokum, you can put it all aside and just enjoy the spectacular roller coaster Verhoeven has crafted, a thrill-ride of rollicking visual effects and action stunts that inspire laughter in all the right ways.<p>The film's beginning is slow and monotonous, as it introduces us to the characters and sets up the conflict. We meet several students at a futuristic high school, on the verge of their graduation and parting ways. It begins with Carmen (Denise Richards) and Johnny (Casper Van Dien) being in love, trying to make it work as they part to train and become troopers, though Carmen gets the wandering eye for a fellow pilot, and they part ways.<p>As all of this happens, a race of alien bugs, which inhabit a distant planet, have sent an asteroid to Earth, which destroys Buenos Aires, the hometown of Johnny and Carmen, who, along with the entire Starship Troopers force, wage war on the bugs, landing on their planet on a mission to wipe them out.<p>The story is small on development, which will turn away those looking for logical plot twists and lucid storytelling. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is concerned with neither of the two, and instead chooses to focus on the elements of excitement, humor, and satire. And for the most part, this gamble pays off, delivering on many of these promised elements while leaving the plot in its wake.<p>I'll come right out and say it: the action is tremendous, big on special effects while low on tension and connection. This is due to the absence of story, but it hardly seems to matter. This is Verhoeven's canvas, and he turns it into a playground for some very stunning visuals that are as exciting as they are completely cheesy (even a five-year-old could tell that the bugs are fake).<p>But, for some reason, it all seems to work. There are scenes that provide a reaction of awe and wonder, such as a scene in which a missile is fired into a bug cavern, creating a tremendous explosion that does all but leave you sitting still. Lots of gunfire, running, chase scenes, bloodshed, mayhem, and explosions keep the energy at a high. These scenes work because their unbelievability and silly conception are so humorous that you can't help but go along with the gimmick.<p>There are even elements of satire present, involving the use of propaganda and images that look like something out of a futuristic World War II. The movie plays like a promotional campaign for enrollment in the armed services, and Verhoeven shows no shame in interspersing such videos throughout the film. Throughout all of the movie, there also seems to be a sense of surreal patriotism that is corny and clich&eacute;d, but works delightfully with the rest of the material.<p>I walked into &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; expecting less than what I came away from it with, and it proved itself a satisfactory sci-fi adventure film. The story is bad, but the effects and virtuoso direction of Verhoeven make this a film for those who consider substance a distraction from style. Just go along with it, leaving scrutiny behind, and the movie works.</p></br></body></html>

This was one of the very rare ones that actually gave me nightmares back in 1981 when I saw it for the first time.  A tour de force of low-budget film making which really shows (for all aspiring filmmakers) that you can make a great film with little money if you have talent.  Sam Raimi has talent.  This tale of five friends who go to stay at a backwoods cabin is truly terrifying.  The cabin is in the middle of nowhere and the cabin itself is a ramshackle mess.<br /><br />The first signs you get of something wrong is when the wooden porch swing moves slightly and then abruptly stops.  The group finds a book (Necronomicon) and tape recorder with a guy doing weird incantations.  Soon Cheryl is guessing the playing cards without seeing them and is promptly possessed by a demonic spirit, taking a pencil and driving it into the ankle of another girl.  They eventually fight her off and lock her in the cellar where she taunts them.  One by one the rest of the friends become possessed except for Ash (Bruce Campbell) and he finds himself fighting off the demons by himself.<br /><br />There are some really creepy scenes such as when Cheryl is sexually assaulted by a tree, and when Ash's girfriend playfully taunts "Were gonna get you...We're gonna get you"  These are shudder inducing scenes!  The blood flows freely and thick as Ash does everything he can to destroy the demon's human bodies.<br /><br />Raimi's cheap but effective gore, and dis-orienting camera work add to the unsettling feeling of the film.  The actors, while all inexperienced and most doing their first film really do a fantastic job, especially Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl.  Raimi is evidently doing a big budget remake of the film set to come out in the next couple of years.  A fantastic horror film and it still packs a punch.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>EVIL DEAD is an incredibly creepy, gooshingly gory, immensely entertaining movie. When you consider that Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and their friends just decided to make a horror movie and went out and did it, it boggles the mind! They were all just kids from Michigan State University, on a top-secret (so secret, they didn't know it themselves) mission to make movie history. The result is an intense 85 minutes of dread and terror! Ash (Campbell) and his friends are staying in a cabin in the middle of the deep woods. They have no idea that this particular cabin is the stomping-grounds for a demonic presence of pure evil. Unleashed through a tape-recorded recitation, the dark forces descend upon Ash and company, possessing them and playing sadistic games with each. Death, oozing gore, and rape by a tree (!!) are only some of the things that make this unforgettable. Turn out the lights and enjoy...</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>this is horror at its campiest best!down to the omnious hum from the woods,this is a masterpiece.5 friends go to an isolated cabin in the woods for a getaway they wish they would have gotten away from.an old book and reel to reel recorder found in the cellar raises their curiousity and they begin to read/play ghoulish items.that was their 2nd biggest mistake.turns out,these are the belongings of the dead.once played/read,the dead shall inhabit the living.now the 5 are in a battle amongst themselves for survival.the transfer is exceptional,however,the VHS version has that grainy quality that makes the overall atmosphere that more terrifying.theres lots of extras and out takes here and the fleshy cover is neat.this is worth the money if youre a big fan or have yet to invest in 1 of the other 3 versions.i really wish studios wouldnt rob us so blatantly by releasing these special editions.DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME PLEASE!...</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZXDBATXFNZX.html">A3QZXDBATXFNZX</a><br/><p>Sam Remi'es Evil Dead is a landmark film not just for its violent contant. (and when I mean violent content I mean it)But for its low buget quality, humor and apsoultly brillent photography. This film as set the standerd for all cult films. The DVD is good even theo I got the one that dosent have any goodies. The only goodies that are good is a brand new tranfer thats really all I care about. Because everthing thats on the other DVD you can easly find off the internet.<p> WARNING: This film is rated NC-17 for extremely graphic prolonged gurosume violence including A extremely graphic rape scene (by a tree) extremely strong graphic gore, disturbing violent images,strong graphic violent images,graphic gore images,and strong language. this violence is bad and this film is for adults only.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Let's face it, when it comes to pure carnage, Evil Dead takes the crown. This is probably the most violent, most blood soaked movie I have ever witnessed in my life -- Isn't it just wonderful? 5 college students head to a secluded cabin for a weekend retreat. They discover a tape recorder of a professor talking about demons taking over his wife, which also awakens the spirits in the cabin and strange stuff starts going down. Ash, the main character's sister starts going loony and turns into a zombie. And of course, one by one, each of Ash's friends are also possessed by the Evil, until only Ash is left and must discover how to destroy the evil and make it out alive. Evil Dead is nonstop &quot;red&quot; action. You will be on the edge of your seat after the first 15 minutes of this flick. Sam Raimi's directing style is very intense and gives this movie it's beef. I suggest this movie to ANY horror fan. Parts 2 and 3 got just plain silly, but the original will always be a classic in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"The Evil Dead" was originally turned down by all the major Hollywood movie studios due to its graphic depiction of evil and gore, but a European studio finally released the film after it was previewed at the Cannes Film Festival. Budgeted at around $300,000, the film would become a modest hit at the boxoffice and ultimately garner a cult following after it was released on home video and DVD. The story deals with five college students who embark themselves on a deserted cabin in Tennessee. When they find an audio recording that releases evil spirits all hell breaks loose. Don't watch this if you have a weakness for scary films as "The Evil Dead" is probably the most gruesome horror flick I have ever witnessed, even more so than "The Exorcist". Running at just under 90 minutes, the DVD comes with audio commentary by its director/writer Sam Raimi and producer Robert Topert, behind the scenes footage and outtakes, trailer, TV spots, and more. There is an informative booklet that accompanies the disc as well. When the film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay the movie was fully restored with renewed video and audio quality. Turn the lights out, grab the popcorn, and watch this little gem. Trust me; you will be scared!</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Sam Raimi's first full-length film, about a group of college-age kids who find a necronomicon-like book and unleash the evil spirits of demons who possess them sequentially, has an enormous cult following, and it's easy to see why. Low on both plot and character, the film instead offers an enormous number of scares and thrills, and exhibits a precocious (and highly effective) use of camera placement, make-up effects, and editing and story rhythms--this is one of the best-paced horror films ever made. Raimi makes reference to almost every film you can think of that preceded it, from the expected (CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, SUSPIRIA) to the surprising (THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, with the shot of the tendril creeping up Cheryl's dress, and THE WIZARD OF OZ, with Cheryl's zombie mocking Ash just like the Wicked Witch of the West mocks Dorothy). The tone is mostly straightfaced, with little indication of how tongue-in-cheek the series would later become, though there are some indications in the demons' impossibly but enjoyably arch dialogue. The film won no prizes for progressive gender politics: the hero, Ash (the strongjawed and likeable Bruce Campbell) basically learns how to be a man by ceasing to protect the possessed female characters and instead beating them literally to bits. But on the level of delivering purely shocking thrills it would be hard to match this lowbudget work.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Outwardly, the limited edition book is a work of art. The appearance does give it the same movie quality "bound in human flesh" look, and the feeling of it is, well, interesting. Its even got an ear designed on the back to help it go that extra mile. Inwardly, I thought the picture recreations were done well, but the inking looks a bit too computer generated. This somewhat defeats the "ancient quality" in my mind. I also had a little bit of a problem with the book having an introduction in it (when I imagine Necronomicon Ex Mortis, I never saw it with an introduction in English) and a nice, fat declaration of copyright on the first pictorial page. And people wonder why they want to take us one by one. Still, I could overlook these minor things and still be very happy with the product because, outwardly at least, its the book of the dead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Evil Dead(released Oct/81)aka Book of the Dead....wow,what legs this film has grown.Made on a very modest budget of well under 1/2 a million dollars,and now said to have grossed somewhere around 30 million(!),this film has taken its gory place amongst its' followers high on their respective film lists.Of course as we all know this was the film Robert Tapert,Sam Raimi(later of Xena & Hercules,and Bruce Campbell all cut their filmic "teeth" on and the rest is history.The film itself deserves no more than about 3 1/2 stars,being a just above-average flick.I am no fan of Anchor bay but they have put together a three -disc set here,worthy of say a Criterion company release;but more on that later.<br />The plot as we all know by now involves a couple of guys with girlfriends and a sister tagging along,who all decide to head out into the remote woods to a cabin.There they find a tape recorder and a strange notebook(that we all come to know is the Necronomicon).They play the tape recorder and find it has the voice of a professor on it,and as he chants some ancient words it arouses spirits in the woods that slowly but surely attack the cabin and everyone in it.One by one the girls and eventually one of the guys all become Deadites and attack Ash,who remains the only one still standing and possession free throughout the movie.But Ash has his work cut out for him(literally and figuratively)as he has to kill each one of his friends.The spirits make it clear they want EVERYONE("join us") and at the end,as Ash stands alone outside the cabin,the strange entity comes at him in a head long rush as he screams into the lens...fade to black.<br />I recall the movie originally and it was quite the gorefest when it first debuted.It certainly looks tame now,as have alot of its contemporaries.They had lightened the rating system I recall in the early 70s so things got a little bit more intense,if that's the word,on screen.Filmmakers really started to push the envelope.What was rated "R" back in the 60s is now about PG today;it's amazing(the times they have a-changed!),but I digress.The special effects,as primitive as they were for the late 70s,still stand up pretty good today.Raimi and company made the most of what they had and used every trick in the book to convey that sense of isolation,dread and horror that became the trademark of the Evil Dead series.Bruce Campbell of course as Ash really makes the movie,as he goes from a very wimpish type character and converts into a much stronger one,due to the forces that he is pitted against.It's do or die and Ash doesn't want to die as his friends did.The rest of the cast do an admirable job and while it is no Citizen Kane,Campbell and company manage to pull it all off pretty well.<br />Technically speaking the film,though shot in 16mm,looks and sounds very good in these prints.It was originally shot full frame so Anchor Bay has gone and included BOTH the full frame AND widescreen prints here for your edification!Each disc has extras and the third is dedicated to nothing but extras.They include:Commentary on the widescreen print by the directors,commentary on the full frame version by Campbell,poster and memorabilia gallery,trailer and TV spots,make up tests,featurettes about the women of the Evil Dead,Campbell and Ted Raimi WITH the women of E/D,discovering E/D,a premiere in 2006 at a Drive In w/ the full cast,the cast at a convention,a reunion panel AND a replica of one of the original theater posters thrown in for good measure.Phew! As I said this is a release worthy of the Criterion company and as such that is why the high marks;as they just put the whole package right over the top.<br />All in all a highly recommended release for fans of the first of the three of this gorefest series.Though not the best it's still pretty darn good and it still has some scare the pants off of you moments throughout.This edition has both the original full frame print and the specially made widescreen print.And with all the extras,there is NO other version to get the Deadite of your choosing.Join us!</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>"The Evil Dead" is an innovative, ground-breaking horror classic that has developed a cult following.  Director Sam Raimi ("Darkman" and "Spiderman") was highly influenced by other well established horror megahits such as "The Exorcist," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and "Night of the Living Dead."  A young Bruce Campbell ("Maniac Cop," "The Woods," and "Bubba Ho-Tep") is college student Ash; him and his friends rent a secluded cabin in the mountains.  ("The Evil Dead" was filmed mostly in the backwoods of Morristown, near my home of Knoxville, Tennessee.)  Demonic forces inhabit these woods.  After discovering the Book of the Dead, the friends begin turning into demon possessed zombies.  There is levitation and green vomit spewing as in the "Exorcist."  They have learned that only bodily dismemberment can destroy a demon.  Numerous sharp farm implements hang from the cabin's ceiling.  Ash uses a chainsaw to slice up one of his friends.  Hence, the similarity to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."<br /><br />  Fans of Lucio Fulci ("Zombie," "The House by the Cemetery, and "The Beyond") will enjoy "The Evil Dead."  It has a tremendous amount of disgusting gore.  Some of it is too over the top for my taste.  It is this excessive gore that kept it from gaining the popularity that was achieved by "Halloween" - another low-budget horror classic.  Also, there is too much dark humor for me.  Some dialogue came across as silly.  However, it helped ease the tension created by some of the graphic scenes of demonic violence.  Furthermore, the acting and directing was amateurish, almost to the point that it lent the film a homemade feel.<br /><br />  "Evil Dead" is highly recommended for fans of zombie films, especially those which involve demons such as Lamberto Bava's "Demons" and "Demons 2."  The DVD from Anchor Bay is excellent.  It has interesting features that include outtakes and deleted scenes and great commentary from star Bruce Campbell.  It is very educational to learn how this movie was finally released after five years of production and at a miniscule cost of $375,000.<br /><br />Note of Interest:  As stated earlier, Lamberto Bava's film "Demons" is similar to "The Evil Dead."  His father, Mario Bava, was considered the Italian Maestro of the Macabre.  In his film "Baron Blood," the hideous baron is released from his tomb when a parchment was read.  This scene is similar to the one in "The Evil Dead" when the five friends listen to the tape recording of a professor reading from the Book of the Dead, which resulted in the demons being released from the ground outside the cabin.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>Anchor Bay's DVD edition of Raimi's goofy, gory cult classic sports a picture trimmed to facilitate a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, catering to 16x9 television owners. Pan & scan butchery was equally ugly, but Elite's 1.33:1 release and all of the VHS editions of identical formatting that preceded it were surely more accurate presentations of this movie, which was shot in 1.37:1. That aside, this is a quality disc. It's unsightly, but that's how it was shot - on outmoded Arriflex 16mm cameras. However, I can't deny that this sounds great; the remastered soundtrack was tidied up just enough to enhance its clarity, but not so much that anything was significantly changed.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell narrates one of the disc's two commentary tracks; Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert voice the other. Campbell's commentary is far more fun: implementing his prodigious memory, wit and charm, The Chin provides an impressive amount of information pertaining to the movie's cast, crew and production, and his narration is as amusing as it is informative. The Raimi/Tapert track is a bit slower; while these two longtime partners are frequently very funny and offer the viewer some curious insights, they're too often at a loss for words and lack the charisma for this sort of voice-over. Also, the production of their track is middling, at best - an ambulance or police siren can be heard in the background at one point.<br /><br />10+ minutes of outtake footage serves as a blooper reel in portions. While some of the accidents and quirks of this compiled reel are hilarious, they also indicate the exhaustion of this movie's famously rigorous shoot.<br /><br />While the included theatrical trailer is pleasantly kitschy, the TV spots are especially fun; the repeated tagline of "They got up on the wrong side of the grave!" always makes me giggle.<br /><br />An image gallery consisting of film stills and scanned movie posters is included, as are brief bios of Campbell, Raimi and Tapert. Paired with the trailers, these are nice materials with which the viewer can wind down after watching the movie. A French audio track is also available (yes, it's fun for riffing).</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>the 1st time i saw this i was blown away by how gorey it was.<br /><br />yes the acting could be a bit better. but damn it is nonstop action. chainsaws,axes,dead bodies oh my! this is a great cult classic. its like the night of the living dead on crack.<br /><br />i love it</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>Its a classic worth whatever you pay for it, so buy it and enjoy it.

All I can say is what in the [heck] was Sam Raimi thinking when he wrote this, if films were still written like this, classics would be in theaters all the time. It was a smart move for Raimi to direct this film because it put him right in the business. This film became an instant cult classic, the underground scene loved it. Of course you have to think right away of Bruce Campbell. This is the man that became famous because of this film; he did an excellent job in this film. I couldn't think of an EVIL DEAD without Bruce. The rest of the cast did great jobs to, Ellen SabdHal Delrich, Betsy Barker, and Sarah York. Of course we have to show some love to the crew working behind the scenes. But finally on to the movie.<br /><br />This is the DVD edition so I will first go over the special features. The behind the scenes and outtake reels are great, but the best are the commentaries. Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert the producer give an insightful commentary track while Bruce's is hilarious. Now to the film, even though there are more special features. The movie has a group of friends going for a get away in the woods in an old cabin. Once there the friends stumble across the book of the dead, and a recording. They play the recording and awake the dead. The friends fall one by one becoming these creatures all in one night, and when day breaks.......<br /><br />There is not enough time to go over how much I love this film it is absolutely one of my all time favorite films of all time. This is possibly part of the greatest series in the history of film; this group of friends that made these films are brilliant. All I have left to say is go buy not only this film but the next two in the series, EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>These are three of the best horror films of all time, if you have never seen one of the Evil Dead films, then you are in for a real treat. The first film is more intense and scary than the last two films but they are a lot funnier (The scene in the second film with the laughing deer had me on the floor laughing). Bruce Campbell's one-liners are hilarious and the gory special effects are a delight to horror fans everywhere. A great series to put on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>I Think I was around 11 or 12 when Evil Dead was first released..The articles in Fangoria, the late-night TV commercials, the creepy newspaper ads....I had to see it! (Needless to say, I didn't....) My friend Bryan rented the tape (Beta!) when it came out, and we hunkered down for a midnight screening. It was everything I expected, and more! The perfect Horror movie.<p>  So how does it stand up almost 20 years later? Well....It's still one of the nastiest, most visceral Horror movies I've ever seen. It's easier to pick apart the cheesy acting and hokey dialogue and situations now, since I'm not 13 anymore. I think the other 2 movies in the Dead Trilogy are much better movies, more polished and professional, but the enthusiasm with which the film was made shines through, so it's hard NOT to get caught up in the spirit.........<p>  Director Sam Raimi has since gone on to become the closest thing Hollywood has to a renaissance man, directing virtually every genre of film: Western (The Quick & The Dead), Romance/Sports (For The Love Of The Game), Suspense (The Gift & A Simple Plan), and Superhero/Action (Darkman & now the eagerly awaited Spider-Man), but it all started here, with the small story of a group of friends in an isolated cabin who accidentally resurrect an ancient demonic force. The film is a non-stop thrill-ride, with the gore gushing freely throughout. The weak of Heart need not apply....<p> The idea to package the disc in a "Book of the Dead" case is pure genius, and the case alone is worth the price. The disc itself is great; Chock full of extras, plenty of Easter eggs, 2 commentary tracks, both of which are hilarious AND informative, Galleries of art, photos, and promotional and advertising material, and a few GREAT documentaries. There's even a hidden make-up test and a hidden panel discussion. (Move that cursor along! You'll find 'em!) The transfer of the film is the best I've ever seen, and the sound is top-notch. There's also a great little booklet, as well as a fully illustrated Necronomicon, as seen in the movie. Just don't read it out loud. Especially in the woods. At night.......</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>Ever since its release back in 1979, Sam Raimi's &quot;ferciously original horror film (Stephen King)&quot; has stood in a class all its own simply because no movie has ever been able to truly succeed it. The film's only true superior is its immediate sequel &quot;Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn,&quot; but most of us already knew that, so we won't count that one in the grand scheme of things.<p>When &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; was released, it was so totally gory, repulsive, funny, and scary that people couldn't decide whether this was visionary-ahead-of-its-time-filmmaking or a total waste of brain cells. The more intelligent among us recognize it as art in a genre during which time was just being rebirthed, thanks to the success of John Carpenter's masterful &quot;Halloween,&quot; which paved the way for pretty much every horror film that came after it. But Raimi didn't do what most of the filmmakers of the eighties tried to do, which was to basically copy the &quot;Halloween&quot; formula down on paper and make a new script with it. No, he had something much darker in mind; something that dwelt within the woods and could be reawakened by the incantations of an ancient book: Nocturum de Morto - The Book of the Dead, later renamed Necronomicon Ex Mortis, which was later abused by producer Brian Yuzna for the awful H.P. Lovecraft film called &quot;Necronomicon.&quot; The book, which served as a passage way to the evil worlds of the beyond was translated and studied by Professor Raymond Knowby, who used a tape recorder to record the phonetic pronounciations of the book's passages, not fully knowing exactly what he was doing with it. The professor ended up dead (we assume) after his wife attempted to kill him while possessed. But the professor reveals one vital clue as to how to destroy the demons in human form: Bodily dismemberment. Do we actually see this? Yes we do, and it actually looks realistic enough to churn a stomach or two. Yet, despite all of this seriousness, the acting of the film is so purposely bad that we realize that we're seeing more than a horror film: This is a satire. &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; was not made in bad taste, as its more hateful critics hypothesized, but on the contrast, it is about bad taste, and about making fun of bad taste in a new way. Not only do we see evidence of this in the bodily dismemberment of one inhabitant of the cursed cabin, but in the &quot;raping&quot; of another, the stabbing in the ankle of yet another, and the decapitation of the same &quot;yet another.&quot; This movie is so full of Karo syrup and latex it would've been easy for it to get lost along the way, but Sam Raimi keeps the film along the same track the entire time, lighting the path with lanterns of dark humor, and it never steps wrong. At its center is a sympathetic Bruce Campbell performance, amazing camerawork for such a low budget, and enough gore for an entire room of blood-and-guts hounds. You gotta love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>I can't believe how scary this movie is.  The effects are reflective of the small budget.  The acting is over the top.  It is utterly unbelievable.  And I love every minute of it.  Bruce Campbell as the reluctant hero, Ash,  is a staple of any horror fan's diet.  Every movie in this trilogy is  revered by any true horror fan.  A cabin in the woods, a book bound in  human flesh capable of bringing back the dead, and the words for the  incantations recorded for posterity only to be played back by unwitting  college kids.  Sam Raimi did a good thing with this and the subsequent 2  movies in this trilogy.  He reminded horror fans that big budgets don't  always translate into good movies.  He reminded us that we can be scared by  atmosphere alone.  And he showed us that when it comes to demons, the  messier the death, the better.  The Evil Dead is a horror fan's horror  movie, a not-so-subtle classic that deserves a place in every true horror  fan's heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>There have been tons of horror movies released over the years. Many critics have noted that the horror films run in cycles with the original films eventually downplayed to comic status (note the original FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA found there way to pairings with Abbott and Costello). That all changed during the 80s when horror films became more of a mainstream favorite and home video took off. Now horror films are playing nearly all the time in theaters.<br /><br />But even those movies don't always elicit fan devotion or repeated viewings. Sure many people have favorites but a true classic stands the test of time and continues to offer goose bumps and nightmare ideas repeatedly. Such is the case with the Sam Raimi directed EVIL DEAD.<br /><br />Released in 1985 (though credits often cite the release date as 1981), the film was a terrifying experience in a theater. I know, that's where I first saw it. The film was released through Thorn/EMI back in the 80s on home video and then bounced around until it ended up at Anchor Bay a few years back. Then Anchor Bay made it one of their staples releasing numerous incantations of the title, everything from special edition boxed sets to bound in the Book of the Dead cover (a main icon of the movie). Finally they've released the film on blu-ray. So is it worth going out and buying the new edition if you own one of the umpteen other ones? The answer is yes.<br /><br />Let's get one thing out of the way first. The synopsis for those who haven't seen one of the many versions. The story revolves around two couples and a sister of one of the guys heading out to the country to enjoy a nice peaceful weekend. Scott (Richard Demanincor) is dating Shelly (Theresa Tilly), Ash (Bruce Campbell who also co-produced) is dating Linda (Betsy Baker) and Ash's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) is along for the trip.<br /><br />The five head to the secluded cabin that can only be reached by crossing a dangerously outdated bridge. Once they arrive at the cabin they work on cleaning it up and trying to settle in, unaware of the evil that resides there. It's not until the cellar door tosses itself open and the look in the cellar that things begin to change. They come across an old tape player and a strange looking book that they discover is the Book of the Dead. The house had belonged to an archeologist who had discovered the book and only realized too late that it contained a pathway for demons.<br /><br />So what do they do? Why of course they play the tape that recites an incantation that releases the demons, the first of which eventually possesses Ash's sister Cheryl. But not until after she investigates some noises outside only to be grabbed by wild vines and raped by a tree branch. To this day this scene is still disturbing though not as graphic as many films released today.<br /><br />The night proceeds and each of the cabin dwellers finds themselves attacked or possessed with only Ash tormented from beginning to end and never taken over. The film offers tons of gooey gore, slashed limbs, stabbings, gunshots and oozing gruesome goodies for fans but by today's standards...well yeah it's still pretty extreme at times. So much so that when originally released, the film was attacked in Britain and placed on the notorious "Video Nasties" list for films that were banned.<br /><br />While watching this film I was listening to the new voice over track that features commentary by director Sam Raimi (who later directed the SPIDER MAN movies), Rob Tapert (who went on to produce TV series like XENA and HERCULES as well as most of Raimi's movies) and Bruce Campbell (who went on to star in TV series like BRISCO COUNTY JR and can currently be seen in BURN NOTICE), but in the background I watched the film. Having seen it numerous times I knew what was going on and wanted to hear the new commentary (which was great focusing on how they got the movie made). The thing I noticed while watching was that the movie still held up. It was still a frightening film. I could see that this movie would induce nightmares in younger viewers and perhaps even in some of the older one. It is still one scary flick.<br /><br />And that's why it stands the test of time. That's why even after 25 years the movie is still an experience that will frighten most movie goers. Even sitting in your living room with the TV going it will be a scary movie with certain scenes that will elicit screams. There are few movies that leave images in your brain that you remember later and this is one.<br /><br />One thing that helps I think is that the acting seems pretty good for a group of first timers or actors who had done so little. These people are believable in their roles and that makes the movie that more believable, even when you have severed limbs crawling or demons running rampant. All do a great job and its sad that of those involved on Campbell has gone on to more recognizable roles.<br /><br />So as for the film itself, yes, it is one scary horror film and deserves to be watched over and over again. It won't make a difference how many times you watch; it will remain scary and give you the creeps time and time again. And that's the sure fire test of whether a movie is worth buying or not, if you can watch it again and again.<br /><br />So what does this new blu-ray disc offer? Well first off Raimi supervised the reconstruction of the film from original prints giving you a great 1080p HD transfer. Kind of amazing seeing as how the film was shot on 16mm back in the early 80s. It also offers a choice of aspect ratios to watch it in, either a 1.85 ratio or a 1.33 ratio, both featuring Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio as well as the commentary track I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />A second disc in the set offers some interesting things as well. The usual cover art/set photos are there for one. It also features some featurettes that have been available in past editions but are now brought together here. These include ONE BY ONE WE WILL TAKE YOU:THE UNTOLD SAGA OF THE EVIL DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD:TREASURES FROM THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR, THE LADIES OF THE EVIL DEAD MEET BRUCE CAMPBELL, BOOK OF THE DEAD:THE OTHER PAGES, DISCOVERING THE EVIL DEAD, UNCONVENTIONAL and AT THE DRIVE IN. Of these extras, THE LADIES..., UNCONVENTIONAL and DRIVE IN were all made in part a few years back at the Flashback convention held in Chicago where the cast reunited for the first time since making the movie. The three female leads continue to tour the convention circuit now and then under the Ladies of title thrilling fans.<br /><br />So there you have it. A run down on a truly classic fright flick that is bound to give you scares. But make sure you watch it in the dark for full effect. And if you think that watching a scary film like this is made better by seeing it with a crowd in a darkened theater AND if you are lucky enough, it is making the rounds to theaters across the country again for midnight screenings. For die hard fans (sorry if you read this after the date listed) make a point of going to Dixon, IL,  where Flashback is having another celebration of the film and star Bruce Campbell at the Midway Drive In on September 10th and 11th. Campbell will be there as they screen THEY CALL ME BRUCE, THE EVIL DEAD and its two sequels.  You can also find make up effects coordinator and artist Tom Sullivan on the convention circuit, especially Cinema Wasteland in Cleveland. Look for the website of both conventions online for details.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>Though definitely not for everyone, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead is the quintessential Horror Comedic Gore film. Filled with outrageous decapatations, bodily dismemberments, bleeding plumbing, exploding chest  cavities, tons of Kayo sryup, a perfectedly cast Bruce Campbell, and an  abundance of Three Stodges physical humor, Evil Dead astounded 80's  audiences with it's warped comically tinted interptation of the  conventional horror film. Though reportedly made for a scantly 50,000, the  film's low budget didn't hamper Sam Raimoi's stylistically virtuoso  direction brimming with oft-kilter camera angeles, hyper-kinetically  panning, and alrmingly ubrupt close-ups from engraving Evil Dead as one of  the most extraordinary enthralling horror opuses in the history of cinema.  A Must-Buy. Definitely a stellar DVD package filled with everything a  Dedite fan could possibly desire.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>Considering the film was made in 1982, and was only filmed on 16mm, Sam Raimi has worked wonders with cleaning it up. The picture quality is brilliant, the whole thing is bright and clear, and the only sign of grain  is in the main title. But apart from that, everything is superb, and its  only presented in 4:3 fullscreen. The sound is pretty good, but nothing  essentially special, but still better, and it contains two commentary  tracks, theatrical trailer, still gallery and 20 minutes of  behind-the-scenes fottage.

The Evil Dead is a bloody, gory, explicit, and sometimes darkly humorous low-budget horror movie. There's no doubt about it. If you have a weak stomach, you'll probably find yourself puking in the toilet halfway through the film. Good thing I don't have one (no offense). This is a gore-filled masterpiece. It really is. If you think Saw and House of 1000 Corpses (both of which are great horror films, by the way) are bloody and gory, wait until you see this one. Like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Evil Dead is a prime example of how hands should be bitten off, and how bodies should be dismembered with an axe. And it's all done in such a low budget; it's unbelievable. I have to say that this is an excellent movie to watch on Halloween, and an excellent movie to watch any day or night. It's scary, funny, bloody, gory, intense . . . . and that's basically how it is.<br /><br />P.S. Bruce Campbell is ****ing awesome. At least in the second half of the movie, anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>The Independent Film Channel has been showing a few classic horror films here lately. A week or two ago, it was the first and third "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" films, and now this 1983 classic from Sam Raimi. I hope the second film is on the way!. This was my first real viewing of the film that I remember. I saw it in bits and pieces some years back, dug it, but didn't remember much of the film as a whole. Boy, I've been missing out!. The movie is unabashedly filled with splattering guts and grue, and any horror fan will relish in the film's over the top gore. Is this the same guy that did "Spider-Man"?. The always great Bruce Campbell heads up the small cast as Ash(Ashley), who goes along on a little outing in the woods with three other friends. Only one gets out alive. They come to a creepy old cabin, and things pretty much go downhill from there. They find odd things including a book made of human skin and a recording from a previous tenant. Before you know it, our little group has resurrected an ancient evil, and they won't be getting out alive. Soon, the demonic forces start to take over the gang, until Ash can put a bloody and gory stop to it. Raimi sets the right tone and delivers his chills and thrills in a nice, organic fashion. Looking back on these older films, one appreciates them more when comparing them to modern ones with fancy effects and CGI. Raimi doesn't skimp on the awesomeness of the idea, and let's it all rip in bloody good fun. The only thing that was skimpy in the film were the characters. With the exception of Ash, The three other friends were mainly decoration to be taken down in the most awful of ways. The setting itself was wonderful, and brilliantly shot by Raimi. Let's face it, the woods are scary. The woods at night are downright terrifying. Raimi uses wonderful skill to make the most of the wooded areas and making them not only sinister, but making them feel as if they were really alive. Some of the make-up and gore effects get chintzy here and there, but most of the time they are a gorehounds delight. What can you expect here?. Impalements, dismemberment, chainsaws, shovels, and so on. It remains to be seen if Raimi will ever return to his low budget horror film ways. It would be too bad if he didn't because he was one of the masters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>I remember the first time I saw previews for this movie when I was little and never taking the chance to see it. I never even rented it and I wanted to, but I was worried about it being just one of those "by-the-numbers, just-like-every-other-horror-movie" type of film. I went ahead and purchased the DVD, hoping that it would unlock some type of reaction - some kind of glimmer of hope. What's the verdict on this low-budget shocker?<br /><br />First off, let me be one of the first to say that the camera angles in this movie really make it quite terrifying. Raimi's camera work is pure genius...he uses the camera angles and frenzied shots to his advantage, and they add more to the film, making it ultimately more creepy. EVIL DEAD is a real treat of a low-budget film, and the atmosphere will give you the chills for nights after you watch this. One of the many reasons this film is great is actor Bruce Campbell, who plays Ash, the hero of the film. His comic turns; his sense of dread; his fear; his anger; every thing he is feeling, you're feeling ultimately more. The other actors in this movie, Betsy Baker, Ellen Sandweiss, Sarah York...all of them lend this movie a realistic sense of dread that can only permeate from a great horror film. Mind you, this isn't just a horror movie...elements of comedy and action also flow into this, but make no mistake, this is still very much a shocker. After five people set out to the woods of a remote part of Tennessee, they find not quiet but chaos after awakening evil spirits in the backwoods with the incantation played from a tape reading scriptures from the ancient "book of the dead". People start getting possessed one by one (all except for Ash); one of the ladies has a rather lewd encounter with possessed trees; a mysterious and angry force is after our hero in the final frame of the film (which is by far one of the best I've ever seen); and Linda (Ash's girlfriend) goes nuts and eventually, is decapitated by Ash, who really had no choice in the matter. All the scenes at nighttime are chilling, no doubt this would be quite scary if it really were happening. Just be grateful that this is only a movie. The ending of the film is one of the strongest, and the sequel would perfectly pick right up where this low-budget chiller would leave us...hungry for more.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a good scare this Halloween, you should look no further than THE EVIL DEAD. Though there are plenty of good fright flicks out there to enjoy, EVIL DEAD is a whole new experience, low-budget done right and done scary. You will never think of the woods the same way again after watching this...anyone rent a cabin?</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>You may need a strong stomach like me to see this if you are not used to watching stuff like Evil Dead. I don't mind it, and it is WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE GORIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN {So far so good}.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Low budget horror does not get much better than &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;. In fact no other low budget horror film even looks like &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; thanks to Sam Raimi (The director of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; for the ladies and gentlemen of you out there who do not know this.) So if you want to see how a big director starts from the real bottom end of film making and works his way up then you need to watch this film at all costs. Besides he was just a young kid when he made it (using a school's 16mm film camera)..... and so were his friends who acted in it.... and they ended up making a film which coined the term &quot;video nasty'! The movie was filmed in 1979 and released in 1982 where it hit the video market just at the right time. It was one of the very first cult classics promoted by the advent of video tape.<p>`The Evil Dead' IS one of the nastiest films ever made. It contains extreme violence, blood, torture, beheadings, dismemberments, mutilations, gore, violence towards women, chain saws - all in FULL VIEW of the camera. No holds where bared in the making of this film but some countries may show this movie in a censored form which entails the removal of about six minutes from the film (This is uncut and the UK recently released it uncut). The story is original, fast paced, scary and extremely enjoyable. Many fans watch it over and over and over again. Many of today's new film making talent watch this film over and over again and it is obvious to see why. <p>The camera work is used unusually, skillfully and surprisingly (so rare these days). The editing is dramatic and the low budget special effects must be given credit for the end results which beat the pants out of some of things that hit the shelves these days. In short, the film making aspect is really what &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; is all about. Here the director is really giving you a bang for what bucks he had.<p>The premise is a simple one to explain. Five young kids go to a cabin in the woods for a short vacation. In the house they find a tape recording which manages to invoke an incantation which wakes up the evil in the woods. It comes after them - turning some of them into the undead, demons, zombies and flesh eating ghouls. Cue lots of household items being used as weapons, an initially sissy anti-hero (Bruce Campbell) who becomes the GOD of million adoring horror fans (you'll see why when you watch it and certainly the sequel is even better still!!) and low budget special effects galore. Copied by a hundred thousand other horror films, exploited by a million uncensored bootleg copies - `The Evil Dead' is still the low budget horror king. And that is a hard act to beat!</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Evil dead is one of my favorite horror movie. It beats the exorcist by a long shot! This film was low budget, not that great of effects, but an instant classic. Evil dead, classic horror film, made in 1979, released in 1983 because it was to viloent. This is a definate must see if you haven't. Luckly I got the limited edition pack first, before it went out of print. Their are great features, and a great quality in picture. The features are great, if somehow you can get this get it! The outtakes are funny, it has a great behind the scenes look, and audio commentary by director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert and commentary by the one and only.....Bruce Campbell. If they do mix him in the Freddy vs. Jason thing he should win. <p>If you haven't seen this movie, this paragraph is for you. This story goes as five teens Ash, Cheryl, Scott, Linda, and Shelly (Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Hal Derich, Betsy Baker, and Theresa Tilly)who uncover the spells of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; and now evil spirits spread all over. Some scenes can be very hard to watch by the goreness. As the virus spreads around Ash's friend, its up to him to survive the massacre the spirits left his bloody friends. It is a must see. <p>I must comment on the make-up. They did a fantastic job on the make-up. Some scenes I seriously thought looked like the excorsist. It has great make-up, and great special effects for a 1979 movie. This film definintley define the words of cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>This is a really fun &quot;B&quot; movie.  If you like horror movies featuring gore and dismemberment, then add this to your collection.  The special effects are a bit &quot;cheesy&quot;, but it's all in good fun!<p>Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>I saw the Evil Dead movies backwards,from 3,2,1.I don't know which one is my total favourite because all of them are great,but I can tell you this one is the sickest of them all.It starts off slow,but builds up as it goes along.I thought is had a claustrophoic look to it,it feels like you're with those five people in the cabin.I really loved the look of the movie,dark,gory,funny and the deadits look really cool,well I was 11 when I saw it.It's one hell of a ride.There's neat bits of Texas Chiansaw Massacre and Night Of The Living Dead in this classic horror picture.Why can't they make horror movies like this anymore.The DVD as alot of cool special features.I recommond this film to anykind a movie fan,you'll love it</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Ash (Campbell) and a few of his friends have rented a cabin among the rural woods in the middle of nowhere. They discover an old book and a tape recorder in the basement. The book turns out to be the Necromonicon and the tape recorder contains readings of its incantations. Yikes! After playing the tape, ancient horrors are unleashed through the woods and the cabin becomes a nightmarish slaughterhouse. One by one, they're possessed by demons. And the only way to finish off an out-of-control demonic zombie freak? Total dismemberment! As his friends succumb to the evil spirits, Ash must fight them off in a bloody battle of unstoppable terror. Evil shows him no pity as he fights for his life as well as his soul.<br /><br />Mixing together a sick sense of humor, bucketloads of gore, and a simple yet frightening story, I believe The Evil Dead succeeds at becoming the epitome of a great horror flick. This is a cult classic if there ever was one, and it certainly deserves the reputation. I recommend it to any fan of the genre. You must see it to believe it!</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>In 1979, after gathering funding from showings of their film "Within the Woods", Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Robert Tapert set out to film a project originally titled "Book of the Dead" ... and later re-titled THE EVIL DEAD.  THE EVIL DEAD is a surprisingly good Indie film, gathering inspiration from THE HILLS HAVE EYES, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (especially), and EQUINOX, and has a place deservedly among those as a milestone of horror films.  <p>Bruce Campbell stars as Ash, a college student who journeys to the woods for a fun-filled weekend in a cabin with his friends (phew).  Soon, however, they learn something is lurking in the woods...and it wants them.  Sexually, physically, and violently, if need be.  <p>Sam Raimi writes and directs this with surprising starter's mastering; Campbell is good, although he'd later be terrific in the sequels, EVIL DEAD II and ARMY OF DARKNESS.  Joseph LoDuca also contributes a good (as well as inspired) score.  Very cool!</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>This is a really really fun movie and I have watched it for the sixth time already cause it's that good! First off remember that you will probably find this movie in the Horror sections and that is very true! This is a horror movie but I like the fact that the directors of the film realized that they had a really cool location to film a creepy style B-Movie and used all of the advantages that came to them after deciding to make this masterpiece. Anyways you should watch this movie cause it's a nice slice of Americana and how creativity can be limited and still have an astounding effect on the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Having been raised on horror films, "The Evil Dead" is a must-see for all hor-gore fans.  It makes "The Exorcist" look like a G-rated film.  It is non-stop, out-of-your-skin, out-of-the-dark, out-of-the-woods terror.  While it is 20 years old, it holds its own.  Many have failed in trying to capture the essence of true horror...this film does it with no finesse, no class, no-holds-barred.  This is one serious horror flick.  If you have a good stomach, love to feel your flesh crawl, haven't had a good scare lately, buy "The Evil Dead".  But whatever you do, don't go into the woods.  DON'T GO INTO THE WOODS!  The entire film is shot inside and outside a rickety cabin in, yes (how'd you guess it?) the woods.  The DVD even has a printed color insert called "The Girls of The Evil Dead".  Does that tell you something?  These three ladies will, at the outset, win your heart.  By films end, they will tear your heart out - LITERALLY!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>Having seen (and owned) "Evil Dead" in many different forms, it is nice to finally get an all-inclusive version. Anchor Bay is notorious for lousy video transfers (the VHS version of Halloween), but this one is surprisingly good. This neat little "Book of the Dead" is a great collectible, assuming you have the cash for it. <p>Rather than give a plot synopsis (if you are reading this, chances are you&#65533;ve seen the movie many times), I will say that this is the only real "Horror" movie in the Evil Dead Trilogy. While "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn" and the later "Army of Darkness" were more comedy than horror, the first installment is a strait-forward horror outing. What sets it apart from other 80&#65533;s horror movies is Sam Raimi&#65533;s stylish direction and Tom Sullivan&#65533;s extremely gross special effects. "Evil Dead" is perhaps the goriest of all the 1980&#65533;s horror flicks, with blood, guts, and body parts flying everywhere. But it is done in such a way as to make it a stylish horror movie, not a snuff film like a lot of early 80&#65533;s "Video Nasties".<p>Anchor Bay gave us quite a package with this edition, so fans of the series can rejoice. Included are no less than 2 documentaries, one by Bruce Campbell himself called "Fanalysis", which give an insight into the world of fandom as seen at conventions. Campbell makes a piece similar to that is "Trekkies", showing all types, and all degrees, of fans. The "Evil.Dead" fans, by the looks of things, are the most civilized out of the bunch. The second documentary is called "Discovering Evil Dead", which has interviews with two early proprietors of home video who discovered "Evil Dead", and were responsible for getting it released to the general public. Also included are the outtakes, bios, trailers, and other supplements. <p>The quality of the movie itself it nice, even though I have heard people complain about the "matted" widescreen. The only other prints I have to compare it to are the Thorn EMI release from the early 80&#65533;s, and Anchor Bay&#65533;s abysmal re-release that I bought in 1998. The image is clear, but a bit grainy in parts. This is to be expected in a print as old as this, and especially in low-budget movies, also like this. I have always loved "Evil Dead", and am happy that I now own it on DVD<p>My biggest complaint is the price tag, which is steep no matter how you look at it. This costs as much as some DVD box sets, and considering the extras, this is still only 1 DVD with a fancy book included. If you are a diehard fan of the series, and want to own a "Deluxe, Limited Edition" print of this movie, than this is definitely the thing for you. If you are indifferent to the extras and just want a good quality print with perhaps a few supplements, than the other editions are a better bet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S9887MZFNNH1.html">A3S9887MZFNNH1</a><br/><p>Now this is classic, a very dark nasty horror film that actually was scary upon first viewing.<p>Bruce Campell is an excellent actor who should be a major star by now.<p>2 brilliant sequels followed and a 4th is rumoured.

The crazy angles and tracking shots are very involving and basically disallow the viewer from not getting trapped into its story.<br /><br />Especially nice about this movie is its fun.  The makers obviously never wanted to let up, so it just delves right in and never stops.  Not only does it not matter that a lot of the events in this film are unexplained, most of the time nobody thinks even to point that out.  The movie is so true to it's own desire to just immerse and never come out for breath that it is wonderfully self-secure.  It only gives a few tidbits of why things are happening to give the audience some foundation so as not to just float away in a random haze of chaos.<br /><br />On a smaller screen, the effects don't seem very special, but on a wide-screen, they are quite good and still very fun.  The entire movie is by no means the greatest horror film in existence, but everything in it is good and just as good as it needs to be.<br /><br />I'd say all horror fans should see it, but especially if there's a showing in an independant theatre nearby.

The viewer is immediately introduced to some kind of evil phenomena as he/she watches from the evil entity's vantage point moving from place to place...I like that about the movie as I think it creates a atmosphere of pure and unalduterated evil which is stalking its unsuspecting prey.  As the movie proceeds, the audience begins to see that these five youngsters are indeed not alone and when one girl named Shelly is literally raped by the woods, strange things begin to happen.  Ultimately, Ash is confronted with a situation that involves all four of his friends (including his girlfriend whom he seemed to love) being killed and turning into some evil kind of zombie like being.  The special effects in this movie are pretty good and this provides some good but somewhat overdone extreme gore scenes.  Ash must either kill these zombies who were his friends, or he risks becoming one of the Evil Dead himself.<br /><br />Now, as I was reading the Amazon.com reviews about this movie, I was so excited about seeing "The Evil Dead" and receiving my DVD copy.  Being a strict horror movie purist and having little patience for nonsensical and corny comedy in horror movies, I probably should have been a bit more skeptical before viewing this movie.<br /><br />There is some cheap and stupid comedy in this flick, but the horror outweighs the bad considerably and I walked away after viewing this movie with a satisfied feeling that I had watched a worthwhile and entertaining horror movie.  That being said, I do not think this movie warrants the raving reviews that it has received...people that believe this is a 5 star movie cannot possibly be 100% pure horror movie fans.<br /><br />I think the overall plot is quite good, but could have been developed better.  There are some pretty good scares and gore scenes in this movie.  The acting is average and the directing is pretty good.  Nevertheless, I give this movie a 3 STAR rating and recommend it to horror movie fans, but I cannot honestly say that this movie is a horror movie classic...it is good, but it is NOT great or a classic by any means.  However, that being said, a 3 STAR rating from me is quite good because I am a rather tough horror movie critic.  I want "scary" or "horrifying" folks, not funny.  While "The Evil Dead" has some scares, it is also innundated with comedy as well.  That's just not good enough to be an all-time horror classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>This movie is a total fluke to me.

There are very few movies that I consider truly scary, but this low-budget Sam Raimi masterpiece of gory terror managed to delightfully tweak my hard-to-find fright nerves on several occasions.  I was scrabbling to return light to my darkened room as soon as the end credits appeared.  High school buddies Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, with the help of Robert Tapert, took their work very seriously, studying the reaction of drive-in horror movie audiences to see what works and what does not work in this type of film.  This research made them wise beyond their early twenty-something years, as they committed themselves to a creed of "the gore the merrier," never letting up for a second once the real horror began.  <p>Raimi, Campbell, and Tapert parlayed a sixteen hundred dollar thirty minute film called Within the Woods into a three hundred fifty thousand dollar investment venture to make this film, originally called Book of the Dead.  They led a small group of visionaries, including the unforgettable ladies of Evil Dead, into the cold Tennessee wilderness and proceeded to make, sometimes almost on the fly, one of the most effective, unrelenting scary movies of all time.  As the story goes, five young people, two men and three women, travel deep into the countryside to a run-down cabin for reasons never explained, discovering far more than a mysterious tape recording and obviously infernal book bound in human skin in the cellar.  The tape reveals the voice of a supposed scientist who had come to this desolate spot along with his wife to study the ancient Sumerian Book of the Dead which he had discovered.  Foolishly, he records himself reading the ancient tongue of the book&#65533;s demonic conjurations, and even more foolishly Ashley "Ash" Williams (Bruce Campbell) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) play these words, unknowingly calling forth from the earth an evil more ancient and terrifying than anything they could ever have imagined.  Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), having earlier witnessed undeniable manifestations of something not good underneath the cellar door, foolishly goes out into the night in search of whomever she knows it out there, finding only a forest of trees seemingly alive and determined to rape her.  After finding her way back to the cabin, she is the first person to be possessed by the appropriately named Evil Dead, and she delivers what is to me the most satisfying attack in a movie bursting at the seams with one attack after another.  One by one, as the terrifying night unfolds, the quintet of friends are possessed and changed into disgustingly foul demons, until only one gore-encrusted survivor is left to battle his former friends for a life that can no longer even seem worth living.  <p>I went into this film somewhat questioning the power of its legendary heritage, but once the first zombification scene rolled around, I knew that The Evil Dead was going to fully live up to its dark promise.  These poor ladies, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker, and Theresa Tilly, let the makeup artists do anything to them, and they willingly and enthusiastically turned themselves into the sickest of creatures.  I can hardly imagine how much Karo syrup was procured for this production, as the blood and gore just kept coming nonstop.  The fight for survival led to the brutal use of axes, fingers to the eyes, shotguns, planks, everything within reach of the victims in that truly creepy little cabin in the dark woods.  Bruce Campbell took some time to grow into his role, but once his wimpy character saw what he had to do if he were to have any chance of surviving, he turned in a magnificent performance, exhibiting fear and loathing as well as any horror movie actor I have ever had the demented joy of watching.  <p>The Evil Dead is a landmark horror film that all fans of the genre should be required to see, preferably in the darkest, more fear-enducing environment possible.  Having it available on DVD in widescreen format is wonderful in and of itself, but this DVD (ASIN B00005R24K) comes with extras to further delight the gore-lovers out there.  You get the theatrical trailer, four TV spots, a poster and still gallery, impressively lengthy cast and crew biographies, a Ladies of the Evil Dead booklet containing modern interviews with the movie's intrepid female stars, outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage, and not one but two audio commentaries for the film, one with writer/director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert and one with legendary star Bruce Campbell.  The Evil Dead is a horror fan's most demented dream come true.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>"The Evil Dead" is one serious horror masterpiece. It makes "The Exorcist" look like a "G" rated film. My flesh is still crawling...it will definitely give anyone nightmares, and this digitally remastered version has it all. I bought the Special Edition on DVD. I have never seen more gore, greater sound, so many jump-out-of-your-skin scenes in my life. If you are a horror fan...and have a strong stomach...this one's for you. No kidding everyone...this is a SERIOUS film. It was rated NC-17 when it first came out in 1982. It should stay that way! I was raised on horror films, but I never thought they'd go this far!!! The setting is a deserted cabin in the woods. For 85 minutes you never leave it...nor do you want to! Don't go into the woods! Whatever you do, don't go into the woods! Of all people, I may not sleep well tonight. This film accomplished what I thought no horror flick could ever do...it scared the %$#( out of me. There have been "moments" in other films, but this one is non-stop. I think I'll take a break now and go watch "Peter Cottontail" or something. Wanna get scared? Wanna venture deep into the horror genre'? See "The Evil Dead" and don't let anyone or anything interrupt you. It's better than any thrill ride I've ever been on. It takes your stomach to the same place. I gave it 5 stars on Amazon.com scale.  It deserves a 6.  Don't rent this.  Buy it!  It's one you'll want to relive over and over again when you need/want a good scare...or need/want to scare others.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Sam Raimi's crafted one of the finest horror films of all time with the original Evil Dead, which became a landmark film for the horror genre.  First off you can tell the film is low budget, but that didn't stop Raimi from crafting a wild, shocking, well rounded movie that created an entire cult legacy.  In case you don't know the story by now, five college students go on vacation at an abandoned cabin, only to find the Necronomicon and inadvertantly release some very evil spirits that takes over each person one by one until only our reluctant hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left.  What follows is a wildly entertaining horror thrillride that pulls out as many stops as Raimi can handle behind the helm with the claustrophobic, eerie atmosphere of the cabin and the surrounding, living forest, and some greatly disorienting and dizzying camera angles.  The makeup effects team used the small budget as best they could to create some great blood and gore effects (I still can't get the image of one of the girls knawing her hand off), and Bruce Campbell is equally great in his defining role, although he would not be the slapstick ridden hapless hero of the later films Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.  All in all, if you want to watch a real horror movie thats budget didn't strap its' imagination, then there isn't a better time then now to get this new special edition of Evil Dead.  Plus, the Book of the Dead casing is fantasticly designed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>Five college students take a getaway trip to a remote cabin deep within the Tennessee woods. Ash, his girlfriend, his sis, his buddy, and his buddy's girlfriend. The place is eerie and disturbing, and there's something creeping around in and out. While checking out the basement, Ash and his pal find an old book, a dagger, and a tape containing an ancient ritual chant that awakes the Evil Dead! From here on out it's gore and mayhem Sam Raimi style! The kids struggle to stay alive, but things just aren't going their way! And by the end of the film, an unlikely hero is born! You won't know that though, unless you check out the sequels, Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn, and MY personal favorite, Army of Darkness. I liked them so much I dressed as Ash a couple Halloweens ago, and will likely do it again, using this book as a prop next time!<br />  This is just the coolest thing I've seen in a while! I wish more DVD's would go the extra mile the way they did with this one! I must admit, when I first saw this DVD in person I was a bit disappointed because I thought it was supposed to be much bigger, and was worried it would be around regular DVD size. Problem was I was thinking of the way the book was presented in Army of Darkness, I had forgotten that in Evil Dead, it IS around DVD size. Anyways, realizing this upon viewing the movie again, I was quite happy. The case is outstanding! You can see that by the pic. Inside are the actual pages of the Necronomicon, as seen in the trilogy, and the cool thing is that the text CAN be read if you concentrate! There are hidden little phrases throughout, such as "Make movies, not war!" 10 stars for the case alone baby! As for the disc, another winner! I had this film on VHS, and had been waiting for a definitive DVD before shelling out the cash for one! This is the one to get if you weren't sure which Edition to buy! And buy it now! At 29.99 it is a tad over priced, but from what I have read the price is only going to go up! Anyway, back to the disc, it contains the trailer and TV spots, a still/poster gallery, two commentaries, one by Bruce Campbell, which is hilarious, and one by writer and director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, which is watchable, there's an outtakes real that I admit I didn't find all that great, a fan documentary done by Bruce Campbell (awesome!), a short film of interviews about trying to get the movie made, and I have no idea if I'm leaving something out! The film itself is a classic of course, and it's great to see it in widescreen on DVD quality! I remember the first time I saw it, back in high school, and it scared me to death! The sequels just get better and better too! Do yourself a favor and pick it up before it's gone! And if after viewing all 3 films, you're itching for part four, grab "Evil Dead:Hail to the King" for the Playstation video game system.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Despite being made for almost nothing by people who were hardly professionals, The Evil Dead is an extraordinarily effective and suprisingly well-made horror movie that is capable of scaring just about anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>As far as teenage horror movies go this is pretty decent stuff. It is easy to see the tongue in cheek humor as well. I can see why it is a cult favorite. Part of a trilogy I think they got better as actor Bruce Campbell and Director Sam Raimi felt comfortable with this theme and took it further and further. By the time they got to "Army of Darkness" it became mostly comedy with some horror. AOD is my favorite of the three because of the outrageous bits and great special effects. This is a great collection for fans of horror/comedy movies. If you enjoyed this catch "Scary Movie".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>The Evil Dead(or Book of the Dead, as it was originally called) is a 1981 horror film that was written and directed by Sam Raimi. He's famous for movies such as Darkman, The Quick and The Dead, and Spider-Man. Although this isn't his first film, it is his most widely 'acclaimed' film. The film stars Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. It was made on a budget of $375,000.  It tells the story of five college students who take a vacation in the woods at a cabin which quickly turns into horror when they find an audiotape that is a key to unlocking evil spirits. The film was extremely controversial, in its' day, for its' graphic violence and gore. It is accepted as a classic in the genre these days and has a cult following worldwide.<br /><br />Originally, when I first saw the movie years ago, I didn't like it so much. It was quite different than horror movies of the day back then because of its' excessive use of violence and gore as well as its' dark humor. It wasn't til recently when I purchased the movie that I seen it for what it was truly worth. It's absolutely brilliant. A classic, for sure.<br /><br />If you collect horror movies on DVD, this  is a classic you definitely need in your collection. It stands as a testament of horror movies from way back in the day. You'll get a kick out of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>It may not look like much by today's standards, but for the budget that was used making this movie, it really comes off great. This film is different from the two sequels in a couple of ways, one being that Ash is more of the cowardly co-star and second being that this is strictly horror. Not that it is really scary, but it's intention are in that genre with no real laughs intended. Everytime I watch the movie, I am amazed with how much was able to get done with such a low amount of money to spend and how well the movie comes off. It is just as good as any major film of the same year, you can't really tell the difference between a big budget horror movie and the Evil Dead when it comes to quality.<br /><br />It is easy to tell that there was talent that was working in front of and behind the camera. Not just Bruce (who would be the only star with any future success in film), but everyone else was equally impressive. The way the entire movie was written, set up and shot is nothing short of amazing for a young director and writer (Sam Raimi). Overall, if you have seen any of the other movies in the series or never have, this movie is a big recommendation. Just know that this is different from the other movies, as I said, Ash isn't the heroic icon he is known for now with the quick one liners. He is more of a side kick who accidentally has to survive his friends turning evil.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Even though it seems cheesy, even laughable today, there's no denying "The Evil Dead" is still a landmark moment in the horror genre. Made for virtually no budget by a group of struggling young filmmakers straight out of college, "The Evil Dead" became one of the most original films in the horror genre as well as films in general, and is still vastly entertaining today.<br /><br />Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) and his friends have gone upstate to rent a cabin in the woods. Everything seems well at first until they find the so called Book Of The Dead, which is supposed to unleash unspeakable evil. That unspeakable evil is manages to one by one, turn each cabin dweller into mindless, bloodthirsty zombies, until Ash is the only one left standing.<br /><br />The plot is pretty much that, but it's still a thrill to watch. The death scenes are both hilarious and creative, and the performances are great, especially Campbell, who became a cult icon thanks to his performance as Ash.<br /><br />This new special edition comes with a wealth of special features, including audio commentary from the stars and the crew (including director Sam Raimi), and crystal clear sound and picture quality.<br /><br />An absolute must have.</p></br></body></html>

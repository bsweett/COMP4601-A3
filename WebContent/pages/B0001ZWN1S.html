Realistic and believable story.  Highly moral story too, with universal appeal about the choices that a person in power has to make and how it changes his character.  Good screenplay. There was a scene where Al Pacino is the godfather to his sister's child.  He's standing in church with the baby and the priest is chanting religious words about such things as resisting the power of Satan.  While this is going on the scene changes back and forth to the murders that are taking place at that very moment due to Al Pacino's orders.<p>The authenticity of detail was outstanding, giving specificity to the setting and to the individuals.  Each character was unique and interesting. And the dialogue had enough of an edge to feel real.  No wasted words, no wasted action.  This video definitely enhanced my experience of the book.  The only funny thing is that I had a picture in my mind of what Michael Corelone should look like, and it wasn't Al Pacino.  I had pictured this character taller and beefier, with a face that had been distorted by a bullet.  But I really did love this video and highly recommend it.  As a matter of fact, now I want to see the rest of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Mario Puzo was a critically respected but little known Italian-American writer when he published the 1969 novel THE GODFATHER, a book he himself described as a deliberately commercial work with roots in earlier pulp fiction genres and the plot and characters loosely based on various New York organized crime figures and associates.  Puzo worked with director Francis Ford Coppola to adapt the novel to the screen, and the 1972 film was a spectacular success, loved by the public, acclaimed by the critics, and receiving an armload of awards.  That success spawned an equally successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART II in 1974, and a significantly less successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART III, in 1990.  And therein lies a certain problem, for the three films have been re-cut, inter-cut, and fiddled with to such an extent that is actually now a little difficult to see the 1972 THE GODFATHER as it originally appeared.  There are so many versions that it is confusing, but the best guess seems to be the 2006 Paramount widescreen DVD release, which clocks in at 175 minutes--the same run time of the original release.<br /><br />The story, as virtually every film-goer knows, concerns the Corleone family, which is led by patriarch Don Vito Corleone.  The film opens in the late 1940s on his daughter's wedding day, during which Don Corleone receives requests for favors--favors that range from punishing two would-be rapists to securing a film deal for fading star Johnny Fontaine (a character widely believed, in spite of Puzo's protests, to be based on Frank Sinatra.)  Once the characters are established, the film gets underway with mafia trips to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, an attempted hit on Don Vito Corleone, and the Corleone response that leads to a massive gang war, all of this served up with lush production values, remarkably rich "color noir" photography, and significant violence.  And then, of course, there are the performances.  Quite simply, was the peak for all concerned.  From Marlon Brando to Al Pachino, from Talia Shire to an unexpectedly cast Diane Keaton, not a single of the cast ever gave a better performance or appeared in a finer film, and certainly director Francis Ford Coppola, in spite of several famous and widely lauded films, never again reached quite the same heights.<br /><br />Even so, the original THE GODFATHER is somewhat unexpected, and if you haven't seen in some time you may be surprised.  At the time it was considered extremely violent, but in fact most of the violence is implied and that which is shown is seen from a distance, or quickly displayed, or in some other form somewhat underplayed--both the earlier BONNIE AND CLYDE and the later GOODFELLAS are much, much, much more graphically violent films.  What does set the violence of THE GODFATHER apart, however, is that it is remarkably cold.  "It's business," the characters repeatedly say to each other, and the violence involved is performed in a business-like, usually dismissive manner.  Perhaps more disconcerting is how languid and episodic the film is: the pace is generally calm, even to the point of swan-like graciousness, and the story meanders through the lives of the characters without the usual beginning-middle-end structure most American moviegoers expect.  To a certain extent, one can actually describe THE GODFATHER as something of an art film, something distinctly atypical of American movies of the 1970s and even more atypical of American movies as they exist today.<br /><br />Many critics regard THE GODFATHER as the single finest crime film ever made.  I would not go quite that far--I think the 1974 CHINATOWN and the 1990 GOODFELLAS equal it.  Many critics regard it as the second best American film overall, following closely behind the 1941 CITIZEN KANE.  Again, I would not go quite that far; there are many, many films that vie for the title of "best," too many for anyone's designation to be more than trivial opinion.  Even so, I think it is entirely safe to say that THE GODFATHER, the film that was originally shown on 1972 screens, has stood the test of time--and will go on doing so for as long as motion pictures are shown.  The 2006 Paramount DVD contains nothing in the way of bonus material, and if you want that you'll have to go to a boxed set or some other incarnation of the film.  But THE GODFATHER is good enough to stand on its own without the support of bonus material.  In the end, it is the film that counts, and THE GODFATHER is indeed a truly great one.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />In Memory of Roscoe, Faithful Companion, 1999-2011</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Marlon Brando is the Godfather and he takes care of family business.  If you're respectful, he'll do you a favor.  If not, well -- swim with the fishes.<br /><br />Mario Puzo's novel comes to life with the five crime families sorting out their turf in 1946 gangsterland New York.<br /><br />Behind the parties and the family togetherness there's an undercurrent of competitiveness that rears its head with the Solotso guys who want to make some narcotics sales and thus invite the Corleones for a piece of the action and thus help the family businesses.<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse for the Corleone family.  Their refusal to get into narcotics gets Brando's character (Vito) shot and near death.  His boys go into action but at the risk of getting killed, decide to meet Bruno for the ultimate show-down.  And hey, let's get rid of that cop that is on Solotso's payroll.<br /><br />Great film:  1940's gangland is tough, with their Fedora hats and cool 40s Chevy's rolling around.  I almost expected some tommyguns!<br /><br />I was reminded in the re-watch about the horse's head in the bed.  Don't cross the family!<br /><br />Robert Duval is Tom, the family's lawyer, basically.  He is the level-headed, logical one who wants to do business without blood.  Mike (Al Pacino) the "war hero" wants back in on the family business and to protect his father.  Sonny just wants to blow everyone away!<br /><br />The film's complex story and interweaving plot make a plot summary difficult.  You just have to see it.  Intense drama with some comedic elements, it clearly deserved the Academy Awards from the 70s.  Character-driven story at its best!<br /><br />No, it does not glorify the Mafia and teach a generation that being a crime lord is a career choice!  It's a story of family and corruption, risk and torment.<br /><br />Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />Great film!<br /><br />Get the works!:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray</a>]</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>It is difficult to pen a review for a film as magnificent as THE GODFATHER.  A reviewer captured the feeling well in saying that one gets the sense that everyone in this film was born to make it.  It is as if Destiny herself brought together this gripping story, capable director, and legendary actors to inspire one of the greatest cinematic works of all time.  Very few films allow for multiple viewings among non-fanatics.  But though I have seen THE GODFATHER over half-a-dozen times, I never fail to thoroughly enjoy the experience.  It never fails to pull me into the dark and intriguing web it weaves.  And, though it is three hours in length, I never pause it to attend to the rest of life.  This film demands your attention and holds you captive from start to finish.<br /><br />Let us begin with the plot.  THE GODFATHER breaks free from all stereo-types.  It is not a traditional "mob" movie in the sense that it does not rely on violence to energize an otherwise predictable and pedestrian plot.  This film, while quite violent at times, does not dwell on violence.  Instead, we see the true life of the mafia: a world run largely by businessmen in closed meetings.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is an aging Don of the Corleone family.  He has spent his entire life building up the family from the humblest of beginnings.  Now, in his old age, the Don is failing to keep up with the tides of change and his life is threatened for it.  As the Don's control begins to fade, someone from the family must step forward and "take over the family business."  Two mean step forward: the eldest son, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) and the family consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall).  But for all his enthusiasm, Sonny is hot-headed and ill-fit to lead.  He lacks the patience, understanding, and "reasonableness" of his father.  And Tom, while close to the family, is not blood and is, perhaps, too much like the old Don to move the family forward in the twentieth-century.<br /><br />As it turns out, the only member of the family capable of leadership is the youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Ironically, Michael is the favored son--someone the old Don had plans for and the son who could finally break free of the family business and lead a normal life.  Michael is reluctant to have anything to do with his family's business affairs.  At the outset of the film, he does not associate himself with the family, he is in love with a woman he hopes to spend his life with, and proclaims himself to be "nothing like his father."  Of course, the tragedy of the series lies, in part, in watching how good men, like Vito and Michael Corleone, become evil men through a series of little compromises.<br /><br />The acting in this film, as all reviewers agree, is superb.  Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is often said to be the greatest of his career.  Brando manages to breathe life and complexity into the old Don.  Whereas many "mafia" films rely on stereotypes and cardboard characters, Vito is someone we would love to have as our grandfather.  He is kind, sensible, patient, and wise.  It just so happens that he is also, at times, ruthless in his business affairs.  Hats off to Brando for being able to convey that complexity.  I could go on about the excellence of the supporting cast, but Al Pacino really deserves our attention here.  Pacino's performance of Michael Corleone is widely regarded as one of the greatest film performances of all time.  What strikes me about this film every time I watch it is the degree of character movement and development that takes place during its run time.  At the beginning, we see a Michael who is somewhat shy and reluctant.  We see that same Michael become saddened and outraged when his father's life is threatened, and we see him coolly and confidently transition into his role as Don, effortlessly and ruthlessly establishing his position in one swift blow.  Pacino manages to make his movement legitimate and believable.  We feel that time is passing and the years are changing Michael--all within the confines of a three-hour film.  That's incredible and Pacino deserves more credit for it than he was given at the time of the movie's release.<br /><br />Finally, in addition to the great screenplay and terrific acting, Francis Ford Coppola shines in this film.  The film has beautiful direction, beautiful cinematography, wonderful pacing, great lighting...the list goes on.  THE GODFATHER gets everything right.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with THE GODFATHER, particularly at the ridiculously low price you can obtain it for.  The new edition is beautifully done and will be an instant favorite in your film collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Francis Ford Coppola<br /><br />Cast:  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Gianni Russo.<br /><br />Running Time: 175 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence and language.<br /><br />"The Godfather" has the word classic written all over and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques "The Godfather" has not been as revolutionary as "Citizen Kane", but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for "gangster movies", but its influence goes well beyond that.  "The Godfather"'s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every "organized crime film" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in "The Godfather". The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.  But to say that "The Godfather" is simply "influential" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as "a movie about gangsters". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br /><br />As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was "The Godfather". Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.<br /><br />The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.  However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.  To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his "innocence" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.<br /><br />There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.  There has been much speculation on how the events in "The Godfather" novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos? of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane, for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people.  The cinematography of "The Godfather" is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.  The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>In my three years as a reviewer, I have never faced a more daunting task than reviewing "The Godfather". I thought it would've been hard to review "Dark Side Of The Moon", but I now realize how hard it is to put into words "The Godfather's" effect on pop culture. From the sweeping epic storyline to the brilliant performances (including an Oscar-winning performance by Marlon Brando) to everything in between, everything is so hard to explain.<br /><br />What I can tell you however is that one of the few films in the world worthy of the title "must own". Nobody can have a truly enviable dvd collection without this 1972 cinematic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and featuring a stunning array of some of the film world's greatest talents, including Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a host of others. Unlike most film addaptations, the film stays true to Mario Puzo's ingenius original novel. There are very little differences (I'm sure there are some) between the book and the novel (at least from a general outlook).<br /><br />And back to the acting. It is evident from his first line that Brando never had a finer role than beleagured mob boss Don Vito Corleone. Brando packs an emotional wallop into his performance. From this performance it's easy to see why all of Hollywood still worships at his feet. Al Pacino as his son Michael Corleone proves that he truly was worthy to be Brando's successor, and for the most part retains that status even today ("Gigli" not withstanding). James Caan is brilliant as Sonny, who meets a gruesome end (one of cinema's best deaths) at a toll both. Future Woody Allen cohort Diane Keaton shimes as Kaye Adams, Michael's much put upon girlfriend who loves him yet cannot put up with his violent lifestyle. Robert Duvall plays the adpated Corleone brother, Thomas Hagen, and plays the role to a tee. Talia Shire, though forever remembered as Adrienne from the "Rocky" series, is perfect for Connie, the lone Corleone sister. And the actor who plays Fredo (unfortunately, I forgot his name, John something, I think) is really good and unfortunately passed away at a young age.<br /><br />This is truly an example of a cinematic masterpiece. If you do not own this dvd, you must get it. Otherwise, your dvd collection will be empty without it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>The Godfather is one of the greatest movies ever made with a great story and impressive cast.  The movie tells the story of the Corleone family, one of the Five Families in New York City.  Headed by Don Vito Corleone, the family must survive in the changing times after World War II as the drug industry begins to spread in America.  The Godfather must try and hold his family and empire together against the other mafia families, but also against his own family.  This movie has become an important part of American pop culture for good reason.  The movie is full of great characters, fantastic one-liners, the instantly recognizable theme, and the  still alarming violence.  This is a great movie that should not be missed by movie fans everywhere.  <p>  Marlon Brando fully deserved his Academy Award for his performance as Vito Corleone, the head of the powerful Corleone family in NYC.  This was also the movie to skyrocket Al Pacino to the top as Michael Corleone who takes charge of the family when everything begins to go wrong.  The impressive cast includes James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop, Captain McCluskey.  The movie also stars John Marley, Abe Vigoda, Al Lettieri, Talia Shire, and Richard Conte.  The DVD offers a great-looking widescreen presentation and commentary from director Francis Ford Coppola.  Releasing the movie like this without the second two movies in the series was a great idea.  The other two movies are good, but nowhere near as good as the original Godfather.  For one of the best movies ever to come out of Hollywood, check out The Godfather!</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>It is not until very recently that I got to see the whole movie, I had seen bits and snippets of it here and there. Now having seen the whole movie, I can understand (and appreciate) the various things that have been referred to in pop culture, such as sleeping with the fishes, the horse's head, and what have you. When I saw these being referred to, I did know they were from the Godfather, but now, seeing the source material makes me appreciate them all the more, and I can see why this movie was such a hit back in the day.<br /><br />Marlon Brando made an excellent Vito Corleone, and the character is also respectable because he does not merely go on bloody rampages, he is calm and logical, willing to discuss things first and solve a problem peacefully before he has to resort to violence. The supporting cast is also excellent - Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and James Caan also played their characters well. I can not give this movie any less than five stars, and would give it ten if I could.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"The Godfather" is one of the "must see" movies that we are sharing with our teens. This is not your typical gangster movie and it won several Oscars in 1972, including "Best Picture" and "Best Actor" (Brando). The movie gets everything right with a phenomenal cast, perfect settings, and excellent cinematography.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story follows the powerful Corleone "mafia" family as they attempt to hold on to their influence in post-WWII NY. The character development is allowed to take place at an unhurried pace as this is a movie that jumps months between scenes, giving us a chance to see how they change over time. This also has some really talented actors, including Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, and, one of my favorites, Abe Vigoda (still alive at the time of this review), that were perfectly cast for their rolls. It was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it is my favorite movie by him as well. The action is well spaced throughout the movie and it is not needlessly graphic, but certainly feels realistic. The settings and attention to detail makes it easy to forget that wasn't actually made in the 1940s, really helping the viewer to become immersed in the atmosphere. The cinematography was also outstanding, using great perspective shots and often implying more than what was shown.<br /><br />This is definitely a classic that is as good as it is said to be.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>The Godfather is the quintessential example of a movie classic that has survived and thrived in the 20th century. Unlike some classics (such as Citizen Kane), The Godfather is just as relevant to modern viewers as it was 40 years ago. The movie does look a bit grainy, but far from distracting the grain gives the movie a 1950s look appropriate to the era.<br /><br />The characterization is absolutely engrossing. Far more than almost any other film I can think of, The Godfather creates complex characters with genuinely ambiguous morals. The movie is never so fascicle as to treat any of the characters as good or evil, heroes or villains. The film never depicts the "mafia" as a whole is good or evil, but rather shows the tensions and moral compromises of life in the moral grey zone. By the end of the movie, you're not quite sure whether you should feel sorry for the Corleones or hate them.<br /><br />Rather than go on ad nauseum about about how much I love this movie, I'll just end by noting that this is perhaps the only movie that came out before 1973 - except perhaps Lawrence of Arabia - that general audiences will continue to watch in another 40 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>This is the chilling saga of the Corleone family's rise and fall from Sicilian crime roots to powerful criminal ties in the United States.

While I do admire Orson Welles, I don't necessarily count Citizen Kane as my top favorite classic. Not even Lawrence of Arabia or Schindler's List or It's a Wonderful Life (despite being spectacular masterpieces in their own right) are at the top of my own list. So which film IS at the top? Well, take a look at the DVD cover on this Amazon page, and it should be very obvious . . .<br /><br />This is Francis Ford Coppola's greatest work of art, and without a doubt one of the finest motion pictures to ever be released. It may be overrated by some, but to me, this is the one that will last a lifetime. I won't go into full detail of the plot, but I will tell you that the concept of mobsters being psychologically complex is particulary stunning (not only because it was highly unusual at the time, but because it makes everything in the film so unique). Scarface and Goodfellas had it good also, but this is the original that you "can't refuse".<br /><br />However, those who have not yet seen this film and are expecting some typical Hollywood action and adventure will be highly disappointed. This is a drama film, but a brilliant drama film. The tension between characters, the atmosphere in every interior settings, the dialogue, the music, and the heavily brutal violence are almost perfect from beginning to end. The acting in this film is also extraordinary. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton, Vigoda, Lettieri, and Castellano give flawless performances. They're believable in their roles, and they never overact.<br /><br />It's almost hard to believe that this was filmed with a low budget, but Coppola and his crew were able to pull it all off. Alongside The Godfather Part II, these extraordinarily iconic films will never accept extinction, and we fans will make sure that it never does.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Long before "The Sopranos," a young Coppola transformed our understanding of the relationship between organized crime and corporate American profiteering with this operatic ode based on Mario Puzo's acclaimed novel. Moody and violent, with Gordon Willis's Technicolor photography adding a sepia-toned period look, "Godfather" combines a bullets-blazing mobster film with a gripping family saga. And what a cast: Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton are all superlative. Brando, of course, achieved yet another level of cinematic fame with his iconic portrayal of the title character. Coppola fought with Paramount to achieve his personal vision, but ultimately triumphed, winning the 1972 Oscar for Best Picture.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.<br /><br />I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.<br /><br />I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.<br /><br />Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the "message" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.<br /><br />But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.<br /><br />Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.<br /><br />This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live. From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.<br /><br />Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.<br /><br />Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>After I purchased Mario Puzo's novel, I stayed up most of that night reading it. Two years later, this film adaptation appeared and I have since seen it (as well as Godfather Part II) more than a dozen times. Francis Ford Coppola deserves all of the praise and awards these films have received over the years. He should also be admired for insisting that Pacino and Brando be cast in two of the major roles despite strong opposition from Paramount. Coppola assembled a superb cast but also an equally talented crew. Those who share my high regard for it no doubt have their own favorite scenes. Mine include Michael's enlistment of a bewildered young man's assistance at the hospital until members of the Corleone family arrive to protect their don, the sequence in the restaurant which results in the killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey, Tom Hagen's discussion with Jack Woltz during dinner, Michael's reunion conversation with Kay as they stroll in a New England village, and the montage of executions during the baptism. None of the extensive violence in the film seems gratuitous. Each major character is fully developed. The cinematography and score are outstanding, although neither was even nominated for an Academy Award. Dark as this film often is, it also has its lighter moments, as during the wedding celebration when Luca Brasi rehearses his remarks before presenting a gift and later when Clemenza teases Michael good-naturedly about Kay Adams. For me, the single most interesting element in the film is Michael's gradual development from his family's baby brother (albeit a war hero) to its ruthlessly efficient don. Once he volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, his destiny is assured. In some respects, this film reminds me of an opera but one with a multi-dimensional plot as well as grandeur in its style, scope, and emotional impact. In 1998, the American Film Institute selected The Godfather as one of the three greatest American films. Only Citizen Kane and Casablanca were ranked higher.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Director Francis Ford Coppola and cinematographer Gordon Willis oversaw the stunning 2008 digital restoration of their celluloid masterpiece. Trumping all previous video releases, "The Godfather" (1972) never looked or sounded better - further augmented by Coppola's indispensable commentary track. This essential DVD stands on its own. However, if you want supplementary material, by all means purchase "The Coppola Restoration Giftset."</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I stumbled across this classic on cable TV a few evenings ago and that was it:  I abandoned all other plans for the evening and watched the movie.  Then I retrieved Mario Puzo's novel from my book collection and plowed through it, savoring and relishing this extraordinary piece of literature that had such an impact on our cultural landscape thirty-plus years ago.<p>Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER is a triumphant, magnificent screen portrayal of Puzo's epic book.  The story of an Italian-American mob &quot;family&quot; entrenched in inherent and often desperate violence, Coppola weaves this film with compelling, moving, and haunting visuals that are as beautiful as they are disturbing.  The scenes are at once simplistic and complex, yet such a dichotomy is not lost on the viewer, but embraced--appreciated for its overwhelming genius.<p>I've seen more than my fair share of Marlon Brando films, and in my opinion the character of Don Vito Corleone is this actor's signature role.  Brando effectively portrays the Godfather's compassion, love and devotion to his family, and calm acumen to make &quot;business&quot; decisions that literally mean life or death to countless men.  Don Vito is both a family man and a killer:  two seemingly inconsistent characteristics that make Brando's portrayal even more remarkable.  The rest of the cast, including James Caan and Robert Duvall, is exceptional, but it is Al Pacino as young Michael Corleone--Don Vito's &quot;baby boy&quot; who was not meant to enter the family business--who provides the most telling role in this film.  Before our very eyes, we see Michael change from a man eager to remain at arms-length to the Corleone family ventures to a ruthless, cold-blooded Godfather himself--a transformation both astounding and eery.  <p>THE GODFATHER is a feast of unforgettable cinematic moments:  from an ambush at a toll booth to a bloody horse head wrapped in satin sheets.  Puzo's story is told--told through filmmaking as good as it gets.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>Francis Ford Coppola directed an absolute masterpiece on film when he made the immortal classic &quot;The Godfather&quot;, which was adapted from Mario Puzo's best selling book about the inner working and ordeals of the Corleone Family who was head of the powerful Mafia organization. An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why.<p>The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the &quot;innocent&quot; son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as &quot;Tom Hagen&quot; as the adviser to the Don.  The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.<p>The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway.  It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family.  I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who havent seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie &quot;you cant refuse&quot; to see.  The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is &quot;Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely&quot;.<p>The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.<p>This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time.  This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is the greatest American film of all time.  It may not have been the slickest piece of film-making or broke any new ground but it's themes, the importance of family, both biological and professional, resonate to this day.  In this case the families happen to be both Italian-American and Mafia, but that's just incidental.  I've never read the novel that this is based on but it's my understanding that Mario Puzo's book is pulpier than than the film that Francis Ford Coppola made of it.  That is one of the reasons that this film is elevated above all others in that it could have been soapier and glitzier than it was but it did not succumb to that and credit has to be given to Coppola as both screenwriter and director for that.  Coppola emphasized in his script it's most important theme, family, and concentrated on developing characters instead of stereotypes.  Yes, some people remember the more violent and sensational aspects of this film.  We also know the people in this film.  The Corleone's are as familiar to us as either are own family or neighbors.  Marlon Brando gives an appropriately subdued performance here as Don Vito Corleone.  His character seems melancholic and rueful, seeming to be mourning his situation in life or the changing ways of his chosen way of life, yet accepts the reality and the responsibilities that come for a man in his position.  Al Pacino in his second film, his first being the little seen "Panic in Needle Park", is dynamic as Michael, the son that the Don wanted better things for but because of changing circumstance is drawn into the family business.  Michael is to prove that he is more than up to the challenge of settling scores.  James Caan as Sonny, the heir apparent to the Don who may be a little to emotional and hot-headed for the job, does tremendous work here.  Robert Duvall is also good in the role of Tom Hagen, adopted son of the Corleones, who acts as lawyer for the family's business.  It also should be noted that John Cazale appears here as Fredo, the ineffectual Corleone son.  Fredo's character isn't really developed until the second installment of this saga but I would like to note that Cazale, who died young in 1978 but made the most of his short life.  Besides appearing in the first two "Godfather" films he also appeared and was quite effective in "The Conversation", "Dog Day Afternoon", and "The Deer Hunter", released after his death.  There are may other great actors (Talia Shire, Richard Castellano, etc.) so numerous who do good work here.  Some would feel that "The Godfather" is a romanticized depiction of the Mafia but I don't see that as the case.  "The Godfather" is a good story whose milieu is incidentally in the world of organized crime.  On a final note, Coppola contributes an excellent and very informative commentary to the film on the DVD that enhances the viewing of the film particularly for those who've seen it numerous times.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>There were too many to choose from.  THE EXORCIST, JAWS, ROCKY, STAR WARS; the 1970s was a decade that brave, new and young directors like Spielberg, Scorcese and Lucas were breaking away from the old Hollywood system and introducing fresh, independent stories and film making to the screen.<br /><br />But it was Francis Ford Coppola who took "an offer he couldn't refuse" and directed Mario Puzo's book, which was, at best, nothing more than a beach read.  The result was a legendary film that redefined the gangster picture as well as the traditional meaning of "family".  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan gave electrifying performances and it won the Oscar for best picture of the year for 1972.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>As nearly everyone knows, this movie is about a mob family, and the movie is wonderfully crafted in every aspect.  I found it gripping from start to finish.  The focus is clearly on the men in the family, since the female characters are hardly developed.  Superficially, one might be tempted to say that this is just a story about a particular group of criminals, but of course there's much more to it than that; indeed, this movie is an iconic classic for good reasons.<br /><br />Rather than attempting to write a thorough review which winds up just echoing what countless others have already said a million times, let me first highlight what I personally find to be the most striking aspect of the movie, namely the moral contradiction of these people.  On the one hand, they care for honor, they love their families, they respect traditions, they're nominally religious, they have a sense of responsibility as citizens, and they have a strong work ethic as businessmen (talk about high-stress jobs!).  But on the other hand, they resort to crime, terrorism, violence, and murder to attain money and power, thus being quite willing to disregard social norms and laws as they deem necessary.  I think many of us are fascinated by this juxtaposition because we all experience at least some degree of moral contradiction in our lives (after all, tough moral choices involving tradeoffs are routine), so a key contribution of these intense characters and circumstances is that they make explicit a tension we're all intuitively familiar with.<br /><br />Another theme which jumped out at me is that the mob is able to coerce even very wealthy and powerful people through violence or the threat of violence.  This is possible because they have an extensive and disciplined organizational structure which enables them to both circumvent law enforcement and apply force which no individual can resist (if you fight back against a mobster, you're fighting his entire mob family).<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a movie one simply recommends.  Rather, everyone needs to watch it at least once as part of their cultural education.  Also, this movie has much in common with "The Sopranos" series, so be sure to watch that series if you like this movie (in my opinion, it may be the best dramatic TV series ever made).</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is one of those films that only gets better each time you see it.  I would estimate I have watched this film 30 times, and each time it is as absorbing in all its detail as the first time - and I just keep seeing more.  Every single actor gives a first rate performance, from the young Diane Keaton - what an extraordinary talent and beauty! - to the worn down Marlon Brando, whose aging shocked my parents.  While this is a kind of pseudo-presidency (or kingship), this is a fundamental study of the wielding of power, the importance of family loyalty, and the brutality of the world.<br /><br />One of the best.  The details matter.  This cannot disappoint.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>This movie has everything going for it and gets better with each viewing. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it is on many people's list as one of the best American films ever made. Marlon Brando gives as good a performance as he ever gave. I'm not sure you would know he was Brando if you hadn't read the credits already. There are great performances by the supporting actors as well: Dianne Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino in particular who does a marvellous job of growing into the leader of the Corleone family after the death of Brando.<br /><br /> Mario Puzo, the author of the novel from which the movie was based, said that he was writing about family. That may be true, but we are dealing here with the family involved in the family business. Two of the most exciting and extended scenes have to do with the most important of family events, a wedding and a christening. Family values? The christening scene in particular is as chilling and effective as anything you'll see in a movie. And I still gasp everything I see the scene with the horse.<br /><br /> Surely the highly successful &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, as well as other movies on the subject of Sicilian families, owes much to &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Beautifully filmed, masterfully directed and acted, this is a film for all seasons.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>For years I avoided seeing this movie.

Generally, when the mob is chosen as the topic for another movie, assuming the film is done with the proper attention and care, it's pretty much a guarantee that there will be the potential for plenty of money flowing in at the box office. Many of the most successful mafia-themed movies rank amongst some of the best films Hollywood has ever offered to the public. With entries into this particular film grouping including some of Martin Scorcese's classics, such as "Goodfellas" and "Casino", to Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", and even on TV with HBO's "The Sopranos", it's no wonder this is a sub-genre that has lasted for so many decades; however, as great as all of those titles are, there is one trilogy of films that truly set the bar for what all others would be compared to. I'm referring to none other than the best of the best of the mafia film sub-genre...The Godfather trilogy. To kick things off lets talk about the one that started it all, the original classic film in director and co-writer Francis Ford Coppola's gangland magnum opus, "The Godfather".<br /><br />"The Godfather" focuses on the fictional Corleone crime family. The family, as led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), vies for money and power amidst the dark world of organized crime. Set in the years following the Second World War, Don Vito Corleone is offered a chance for his family to further expand their empire via the fledgling, yet profitable drug trade. However, the Don is not convinced that this is the way their organization should take for more profits, a school of thought that the other rival families aren't too comfortable with. As tensions mount and battle lines are being drawn, Don Vito along with his sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo, and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), prepare to do what must be done to preserve the power they have fought so long and hard to attain. As an all-out mafia war begins to claim casualties on all sides, it seems some new blood may be needed to turn the tide. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the youngest of the Corleone children, and the one who had vowed to steer clear of the dark world that has consumed the rest of his family. However, certain events are unfolding that will force Michael to choose whether his destiny lies by his father's side or on his own path separate from a life of crime.<br /><br />Based upon the novel by Mario Puzo, who also served as co-writer alongside director Francis Ford Coppola, "The Godfather" is one of the most faithful adaptations of a book that I have ever seen. Having read the book and seen the movie, I find both to be perfect companion pieces to one another. Even though it is cemented within the dark underworld of organized crime, the story is one that can resonate with virtually every person on some level, thanks in no small part to the many themes inherent within the screenplay and the novel.<br /><br />The biggest theme that this film deals with throughout its nearly three-hour running time is the concept of family, displayed in both a literal and metaphorical sense (as shown in the numerous references to a person's mafia affiliation and/or organization as a family). For me this was the most intriguing aspect of the film's richly layered story. Seeing how the various Corleone children grappled with the weight of eventually taking the reins of the family's various affairs, both personal and business related, was truly interesting and provided the strongest dramatic firepower for the script to draw from. For me, making the primary driving force of the screenplay focus upon the family aspect, made "The Godfather" stand apart from all other mafia themed movies that had come before it, and many that arrived after it, for that matter. Many times in these types of films we get a very violent story, full of intense drama and plenty of colorful language, and even some allusions to the themes found in this film, but it seems to be a bit of a rarity to find a mafia movie outside of this series that takes the time to delve deeply into the personal relationships these people establish over the course of their lives and nefarious careers as criminal figures. We all know that the mafia is all about loyalty, respect and living by certain codes of honor, but what we rarely get to see is where those attributes come from, which can only be found in the personal relationships these characters share with each other over the course of the film. To me, it is the personal touches found in this movie and its sequels that make the story all the more accessible, and elevate it from being just another mafia movie to something far greater.<br /><br />The casting choices made for "The Godfather" seem to perfectly embody every single character from Mario Puzo's classic novel, as if they could have walked right off of the page and onto the screen. Marlon Brando ("Superman: The Movie") as the Corleone family's patriarch and Don of the Corleone crime family is simply iconic in his portrayal. He brings a warmth and magnetism to the character that instantly draws you in, essentially erasing all thoughts of the evil acts this man has committed either personally or via his organization. Yet behind the almost grandfatherly quality Brando gives the character, lies an extremely dangerous man, who possesses a quiet and powerful inner-strength, along with a worldly power that is unparalleled by any other member of the underworld.<br /><br />Portraying the other primary members of the story are veteran actors (although at the time they were still rising stars in Hollywood) James Caan ("Misery"), Robert Duvall ("Secondhand Lions"), and Al Pacino ("Heat"). James Caan plays the hot-headed eldest son of Vito Corleone named Sonny, who is first in line to take over the family business whenever the Don steps down or passes on. Caan perfectly portrays the character with a dangerous volatility that is electrifying and borderline insane at times, yet he also brings to the table an unyielding devotion to his family that is both his greatest strength and biggest weakness. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen the surrogate son and consigliere to the Corleone family, seems an ideal choice lending the character plenty of gravitas, while at the same time giving a sense that he is constantly seeking approval from the other members of the family due to him being of German/Irish descent, and therefore an outsider to the otherwise Italian family. Lastly, we have Al Pacino, giving his most restrained performance of his career, long before he became the iconic actor he is today, as the youngest Corleone sibling and the one member of the family that tries his hardest to remain at a safe distance from the crime and corruption that has consumed the other family members. So, in a sense, even though Tom is an outsider due to his heritage, it is Michael who is the one that is truly the outsider, a position that he finds harder and harder to retain the more the story unfolds.<br /><br />Other cast members worthy of note would include Talia Shire ("Rocky"), Diane Keaton ("Because I Said So"), and John Cazale ("The Deer Hunter"). To be fair there are so many more actors and actresses that deserve attention, I just don't have the time to devote to them. Talia Shire played Connie Corleone, the lone girl amongst the Corleone children. Talia does a very good job with her character, even though she isn't given a very large amount of screen time. Nevertheless, if it weren't for her character's involvement many of the major events within the story never would have come to fruition. So, even though she possibly has the least amount of time in front of the camera, out of the entire family, her character's story arc is one of the most pivotal ones of all. The always terrific Diane Keaton is Kay Adams, the young woman who finds herself inadvertently dragged into this dark world through her romantic relationship with Michael. Diane gives Kay an innocence that balances the otherwise corrupt nature of essentially every other character within the film; however, it's fascinating to see her character's temptation by the power and money that accompanies such a dangerous world. To see how Kay grapples with the person she is and the person she may become via her romance is interesting, and provides some very small, yet important moments within the film. Rounding out this particular grouping we have Fredo Corleone played by rarely seen actor John Cazale ("The Deer Hunter"). Fredo is the middle child of the three Corleone boys, and is generally perceived as weak and relatively simple-minded in the grand scheme of things. Even though Fredo is given very little to do in this film, John is spot-on with his interpretation of the character, and it's a shame that an actor as talented as John clearly is, has for some reason chosen to shy away from movie roles ever since "The Godfather Part II".<br /><br />It seems somewhat strange to me that a film such as "The Godfather" has become such a globally recognizable film and essentially a major brand name for games, toys, etc. I feel this is strange partly because of these films' subject matter (which could be perceived as a reflection on our dwindling morality), but also because this film almost didn't see the light of day, at least not in the way we all have come to know and love. Prior to anyone really being attached to this film, the head of troubled film studio Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, was having a difficult time convincing anyone to direct this gangland epic after acquiring the rights to the novel. It wasn't until director Francis Ford Coppola ("Dracula") took the gig, in an effort to save his fledgling production company, that the film truly began to take shape. Even so, if it hadn't been for Francis' stubbornness, Italian heritage, and cinematic vision, who knows what this film would have ended up as, most likely it would not have been the masterpiece it wound up being, that is if the attempted studio tampering had prevailed. So, thank God for directors who know what they want, and have the courage to see their vision through.<br /><br />With a gripping story rife with powerful thematic elements, intense drama, and some of the best acting you will ever find in any film throughout history, "The Godfather" is a film that truly defines what it is to be a definitive tour de force of American cinema. If you have yet to see this film or its sequels, do yourself a gigantic favor and rent a copy today.<br /><br />"The Godfather" is rated R for violence, brief language, and brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top  100), "The Godfather" brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family.  America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this  film takes us inside "The Family" like never before.<p>The script is nearly  flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets  up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and  intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with  them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or  gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.<p>However,  the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and  the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that  it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have  such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of  ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand  that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have  their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.<p>Though this was  more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out,  namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established  superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few  years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding.  Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See "On  The Waterfront", "A Streetcar Named Desire", or "Mutiny On The Bounty"),  yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our  notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a  shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He  presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and  an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other  families.<p>Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to  his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered  a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a  great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is  ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching  romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and  established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.<p>Other  standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the  hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and  visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming  character with a strong sense of family loyalty.<p>This film was nominated  for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for  Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually  own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it  yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.  It  is an utterly perfect 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>A host of factors make this one of the greatest American films.  First, the directing is impeccable.  Coppola allows the story to unfold simply, employing for the most part a static, immobile camera, allowing each scene to unfold like a series of tableaux.  Second, the cinematography.  Most of the craft of the cinematography went into the lighting, which generates some of the greatest use of light and shadows since the demise of black and white film noir.  Coppola also intensifies each scene by using surprisingly little music in the film.  Although the film is famous for its outstanding score by Nina Rota (later discovered to have been partially reused from an obscure film he scored in the late 1950s in Italy, which led to his nomination for an Oscar to be withdrawn, an award he certainly would have won), the fact is that the music is used selectively and comparatively rarely.  Silence engulfs most of the scenes.  And although there are many famous lines in the film, it is driven as much by the silence between the characters as by what they say.  Also accounting for the brilliance of the film is the script, which is brilliant for its simplicity.  Coppola distills the tale down to only the most essential elements, with nearly every shot moving the story along or imparting a crucial piece of information to the viewer, allowing the crucial tensions of the story to unfold early on.  The enormous simplicity in the telling of the tale makes the more complex moments&#65533;for instance, the crosscutting during the baptismal scene&#65533;all that much more effective.  And any listing of all the reasons for the brilliance of the film leaving out the extraordinary art design would be woefully incomplete.  This was one of the first films made that made historical accuracy a high art form, and has exerted a profound influence on any historical film since then.<p>Of course, one of the main reasons this is a great, great film is the acting.  Few films have ever featured so many memorable performances, and no film had featured so many performances by so many actors who were explicitly Italian.  In fact, the film was a &#65533;coming out&#65533; for one aspect of Italian culture in the United States.  Even in films that were fairly transparently about the Mafia and crime families in New York and Chicago, ethnicity was completely left out of the picture.  After THE GODFATHER, everything changed.  The film was Marlon Brando&#65533;s triumphant return to star status after a series of failures, garnering a well-served Oscar that he turned down.  The quality of the acting is shown by the fact that no less than three of the other actors&#65533;Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan&#65533;received nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Joel Grey won for CABERET, in what might have been the greatest group of performances in the history of Oscar for the award).  <p>There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER.  My favorite, and one of the happier accidents in casting history, was that originally Robert De Niro was cast in a small part in THE GODFATHER.  Al Pacino, on the other hand, was wanted for the part of Michael Corleone, but was already obligated for the film BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY.  Francis Ford Coppola worked out a deal whereby De Niro would replace Pacino in the one picture.  Unfortunately/fortunately this meant that De Niro was unable to be in THE GODFATHER, which meant that he was free to appear in THE GODFATHER II as the young Vito Corleone.  THE GODFATHER was a film where just about everything seemed to work out best for all involved, and this illustrates this perfectly.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>"The Godfather" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...<br /><br />His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal "families," and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times...<br /><br />With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...<br /><br />While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by "liquor, gambling, and even women..." He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the "sovereignty." In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...<br /><br />The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...<br /><br />Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment "Never to take sides against the Family."<br /><br />The opening shot of "The Godfather" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...<br /><br />Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:<br /><br />Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather-- steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie "big shot" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...<br /><br />With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact...</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Writer/director Francis Ford Coppola's classic film takes us deep into the world of Mafia don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his sons--Michael (Al Pacino), the all-American war hero who is destined to lose his soul and spend the rest of his life in repentance; Sonny (James Caan), the hot-tempered eldest son who is next in line; Fredo (John Cazale), weak and simple-minded but good-hearted; and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the adopted son who acts as family lawyer and councilor.  Every element of this film is perfect.  I've seen it and its sequels more than a dozen times and am always caught up in this fascinating epic.  Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo never allow us outside the circle of the Corleones, so it is their values that define good and evil in this film, not the mores of society at large.  Simply put, loyalty to the family is seemingly all that matters.  Then why, when Michael finally decides to involve himself inextricably in the affairs of the family out of concern for his father, does he become such a cold and feared figure instead of revered, beloved, and respected like his father?  This is the most interesting question in a deep and serious work of cinematic art./</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>So what can be written about the movie that hasn't been said a million times already?  Probably nothing.  But it is my favorite movie of all time.  I can't say it was catching lightening in a bottle, as several of the actors were famous before, and several more continue to be popular today.  Although it is one of those rare achievements where the cinema version outshines it's literary equivalent.  <p>Movies have the power to create worlds entirely different to us, and in a sense, "The Godfather" is one of those movies.  Yes, there is organized crime, and yes, they still seem to have "families" to distinguish one group from another.  But this movie still created a different world by having no character that was not part of this world in the cast.  They are either involved in something illegal, or related to someone who is.  <p>With this isolation, it makes us look at the film differently than if there were so-called "honest" people as part of the movie.  If that were the case, it would be easier to be reminded that these people are criminals.  And not just petty ones.  We see murderers, big time drug dealers, and those that spend large dollars corrupting the so-called "legitimate" government.  <p>Since everyone is more or less playing by these rules, it then makes it easier to root for what would be the bad guys otherwise.  Vito Corleone has murdered, and ordered the murders of others.  But since we have not been told of the innocent people that were probably killed as part of his ascension, and the fact that he was not eager to get into big-time drug operations, and he was just, well, a grandfatherly old man, he's the "good guy" over that dastardly Barzini.  <p>So we care that he truly loves his daughter and wants to give her a good wedding.  We think he's a good guy because he didn't want "all of this" for Michael.  And we agree that when he says "a man who does not spend time with his family is not a real man", that this is wisdom from what must be a very wise man.  Showing that this type of family can indeed love and care for each other while still taking care of business is what makes the film great in my eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>Generally regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, "The Godfather" would seem to be review-proof.  By this point, some 30 years after its initial release, what else could be said of it?  Critically it's adored.  And those who loathe it are bound to loathe it no matter what I, or anyone else really, has to say.<p>So instead of doing a standard review, I thought I'd pick out key elements from the movie, elements that struck me as important after my fourth and most recent viewing, but that I haven't seen analyzed to death over the years.  This effort will, I hope, shed some new light on the film, going beyond the usual iconic moments (the horse in the bed; the cat on the lap; Sonny at the tollbooth) and memorable dialogue ("I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"; "Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"; "Leave the gun... take the cannoli") to give you something personally relevant.  And if doesn't, then at least it gave me the opportunity to write about "The Godfather" for awhile.<p>"I believe in America."  These are the film's opening lines.  Spoken not by Marlon Brandon, Al Pacino, James Caan or even, say, Abe Vigoda, but by Salvatore Corsitto as Bonasera the Undertaker.  It begins a long speech about how his daughter was beaten to near death, and as Corsitto tells the tale, the camera slowly zooms out to reveal the darkened office, and then the silhouetted visage of Brando.  It begins a curious game of cat and mouse, for it takes a long time for the film to truly reveal whom this story is about.  Now, unless you've been living under a rock for the last thirty years, or, more appropriately, been locked in the trunk of a Cadillac, you know whose story is about to be told.  But let's wipe away hindsight, and assume you are an audience member in a darkened theatre in 1972, one who hasn't read Mario Puzo's soon-to-be-blockbuster book, who'd forgotten the power of Marlon Brando (it had been almost 20 years since "On the Waterfront"), and had never heard of Al Pacino.<p>The first scene makes it clear that Vito Corleone is a powerful presence.  Is this his story?  It would seem so, as his family is gathered together for the luxurious wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  But then Vito's consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is introduced, a lawyer who was once taken in by Vito while just an orphan child.  Maybe it is the story of these two men, the Sicilian-born Don and his German-Irish adopted son.  This idea is nearly cemented when Tom goes to Hollywood, ostensibly to get Johnny Fontaine (Al Martino) out of a binding contract with Jack Woltz (John Marley), but more likely just as an excuse to put a horse's head in a bed.  Back in New York, we are introduced to Sonny (Caan), Vito's eldest boy, a hotheaded gorilla more proficient at quenching his animal lusts than at running a crime family.  Is it Sonny's story?  Could be, could be.  See what I mean?  It's like a great game of chess: director Francis Ford Coppola deploys his pawns, his rooks, his knights, and his bishops, before ever moving his Queen.  But when she finally emerges from her sanctuary, the board is wiped clean with a few bold moves.<p>Michael (Pacino), in these early expository scenes, only acts as a Greek chorus.  A war hero and a college boy, he explains to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) who his father is, and why he should be feared.  And he tries to tell her that that is not him.  But then comes the scene at the hospital.  Vito has been shot, but not killed, and Michael goes to visit him.  Surprised to find no security by his father's room, and aware that this means men are on their way to finish the job, Michael, along with a nurse, decides to move his father to another room.  After a near-farcical scene of hide-and-seek in the hospital halls, Michael, in an attempt to reassure his frightened father, whispers the following lines into the old man's ear: "I'm with you now.  I'm with you."  The double meaning of these words is made quite apparent by Vito's smile and Michael's angst-filled expression.  Just when he thought he was out of the family business, circumstances pull him back in.  Michael's inevitable coronation, and the film's operatic aftermath, is now inevitable.<p>About 110 minutes into the movie, Sonny finds out that Connie's husband Carlo (Gianni Russo) has been slapping her around.  Ever the vigilant brother, Sonny storms out to teach Carlo a lesson.  He finds him on the steps of a brownstone selling drugs, and before Carlo knows what's happening, Sonny is wailing on him mercilessly with punch after punch of staggering power.  Er, all except the fourth one, that is.  Maybe the filmmakers only had time for one take, or maybe a sloppy editor missed it, but the fourth punch misses Carlo by a good 2 feet.  Now, I'm a big believer in the adage, "The exception proves the rule."  And this moment is the film's one blemish, standing out like the Glad garbage man at a Goth convention.  But sandwiched between the film's first and second half, it manages to prove the perfection achieved by each.<p>I first saw "The Godfather" after reading the book as a teenager.  Not the best way to view any film, and nearly fatal here.  I expected to find a lot of the book's rich backstory but didn't.  My first viewing was a disappointment.  Every subsequent viewing, however, has made me fall more in love with this film than I ever thought possible.  And now you know why I chose this alternate method of reviewing: I knew that the hyperbole would flow fast and furious once I begin typing.  Despite my best intentions, I couldn't avoid it.  That is, ultimately, the power of "The Godfather".</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>The Godfather is one of those rare times where everything works perfectly. It is in fact the best movie ever made and at at the very least the best mob movie ever made(Followed closely by The Godfather part 2). Instead of bludgeoning us with shoot outs and bloody deaths, Coppola weaves a character study about a family. Being Italian American myself, I can tell you this is the most accurate portrayal of an Italian American family I have ever seen on screen! Of course there is violence and when it comes it comes on strong, but the heart of this film is in the performances of every person in this film!<br /><br />First rate performances throughout and every attention to detail is impeccable. One of the most amazing performances is Marlon Brando's Don. He isn't on screen very long, but leaves us with one of the most unforgettable and powerful characters in the history of film. The films runs almost three hours, but when it ends you will be craving more. It's just a fascinating film and I can not think of any other film that I have watched more in my life. The DVD transfer is OK, but the new 2009 Blu Ray is the way to go, it's as good as these films will ever look and the new Godfather Blu Ray box set is an essential purchase!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>Francis Ford Coppola had a vision. The vision was made. It was &quot;The Godfather.&quot; From its incredibly well-scripted opening scene to its final closing image, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the greatest stories ever told on the screen. Heck, one could call it a big-screen painting of an era. This was Marlon Brando's finest performance and Al Pacino's kickstart into legendary fame. This is also the greatest gangster movie ever made. Coppola delivers all the goods with this one. We have action, drama, romance, and even the occasional laugh. It is a wonderful image of the 1940s mob scene and was the top of its genre until &quot;Goodfellas&quot; joined it about 15 or so years later. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a timeless classic and a must-see for all film enthusiasts.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>I think it is fair to say that "The Godfather" is among the most acclaimed films of all time.  This movie is huge - an icon - and many since have imitated it's style.  For decades I don't know how many movies have been hyped as "The Chinese Godfather" or "The Modern Godfather".  They all fall short of the original.<br /><br />It's interesting to me that much second-guessing surrounded everything from the story to the casting of actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Those two are joined by Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire and I see I'm using up space giving you the all-star cast.<br /><br />The story, the direction, the lighting and the cinematography were all revolutionary.  It was controversial to make a movie in which the "heroes" were gangsters, but here Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo mesmerized us with the story of men who were at times ruthless killers, yet at the same time devoted to their families and devout to their church.  The backstory of how Vito Corleone became "The Godfather" from Puzo's original novel isn't told until the 2nd movie (with Robert DeNiro playing the young Vito), but we see that these Mafia men believe that they are in a country full of opportunity, but also full of corruption - they know that if they don't exploit the world someone else will - so this justfies their careers in their minds.<br /><br />The movie is a series of virtuoso sequences and performances.  Small nuances are performed with fluorishes - Brando affectionately petting the purring kitten in the opening sequence while men are lining up to come into his office to pay their respects or ask favors of him - because it's his daughter's wedding day he cannot refuse.<br /><br />The wedding introduces the broad cast of characters and we get time to see that Santino is the hot-headed lover, Fredo is the dim-witted brother and Michael is the returning war-hero who distances himself from the "family business".  Although there are literally hundreds of individual sub-plots, the main story of the entire Godfather Trilogy is Michael's, (after his father) and how he goes from youngest son, determined to stay out of the business, to a Godfather more ruthless than them all.<br /><br />After the wedding is another virtuoso scene that sets up most of the rest of the movie.  Al Lettieri as Sollozzo requests a meeting with the Corleone family.  He wants to establish a drug empire and he has already made arrangements for getting the opium and distributing it.  From the Corleones he needs "a little finance" and political protection for when his men are inevitably stopped by police.  Vito Corleone has made his fortune first hijacking delivery trucks, then in gambling and bootlegging, which he tells Sollozzo the police regard as "harmless vices".  He is disdainful of a rival Don who deals in prostitution. At one point he tells his son "Tattaglia is a pimp" with complete disgust.  He tells Sollozzo that he must refuse the offer because his political friends will no longer be his friends if he begins to deal in drugs.  Sollozzo replies that the Tattaglia family guarantee the investment, and that the riches are projected to come pouring in.  Hot-headed Sonny speaks out of turn and abruptly interjects "you mean the Tattaglia's GUARANTEE our investment".  His father has already decided for his entire organization, and Santino, the 2nd in charge, reveals his eagerness to Sollozzo for trying this drug plan.  No word is spoken after Vito shuts up his son with a gesture, but knowing looks are passed between everyone in the room.  There will be trouble because Sollozzo now knows that Sonny is hot for the deal.<br /><br />Sollozzo arranges to hit Don Corleone and his most trusted bodyguard, the fearful Luca Brasi.  What he doesn't plan on is that Sonny's loyalty to his family, and his famous rage, are going to take precedent over any desire to join Sollozzo in the drug business.<br /><br />I have only encapsulated the first act of one of America's greatest film epics.  Although they are gangsters, these characters stick with you.  For many of them, there is "honor among thieves", and at one point a long-time trusted Capo is led to betray the family and you really feel sorrow for him as he is led away and states remorsefully "Tell Mike it was only business."<br /><br />The business of this movie sucks you up into Mario Puzo's world and you hardly feel as if time has passed when the credits roll almost three hours later.  This is the King of the Gangster movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This would have to be one of the all time classic movies. A very good history of the Corleone family. This movie has everything. The role of the family head is well played by Marlon Brando. The roles of the two sons are played very effectively by Al Pacino and James Caan. This movies chronicles some of the events that take place in the world of the Mafia. The attempt on Don Corleone and the revenge by Michael his youngest son. Especially interesting was the method employed by Don Corleone to convince the Hollywood producer to give the leading role in a war movie to his godson. One will never forget the horse's head in the bed. The death of Don Corleone and the assension to power by the youngest son Michael is also shown. The movie ends with a bang with the Corleone family killing the heads of the rival families and gaing vengance for the murder of the Corleone son Sonny.Also to be noted is the outstanding scenery and the way that it is used to reflect the time in history that the events are taking place. Definitely one of the best movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NLH4A3XP4WA5.html">A3NLH4A3XP4WA5</a><br/><p>Quite simply the best &quot;mobster/Mafia&quot; movie ever to hit the screens.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star in this movie of Italian family strife in the 1940s.  The old &quot;godfather&quot; of the Corleone family (Brando) is one of the U.S's biggest leaders of orginized crime families.  His war-returning son Michael (Pacino) has nothing to do with the family business.. at the moment.  He is drawn into a world of crime and strife after his father lays complete family control to his son.  Now, Michael must become the new &quot;Don&quot; of the family, leaving behind his old legit life, and becoming one of the most succesful Mafia leaders in history.  An excellent film of Italian-American life, as well as the dark-nature of the underground &quot;mob&quot; world.  Everyone should see this one.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO092BYA4VMU.html">ABO092BYA4VMU</a><br/><p>Francis Ford Coppola directed this irresistable epic masterpiece, Marlon Brando gave the best performance ever in a movie.

No, this is not a misprint. Brando was brilliant. Yep, my first time seeing him in a film. I don't feel I have to tell you what made this film so compelling. But, seeing as how I'm milking my "redneck in China" and "grits with chopsticks" bit for all it's worth right now, I'll mention juxtapositions. Like watching PURPLE RAIN and THE GODFATHER as a double feature. Who else does that? Both films are stylized, and understandably dated in a few spots. And I thought PURPLE RAIN was too violent? I stand corrected.<br /><br />Juxtapositions of the American Dream, la cosa nostra, and Catholic old Italy. When Michael Corleone went into exile in Sicily, and learned all the men had been killed in vendettas, the first memorial he saw was to Alfredo LaRocca. When he courted Apollonia, I almost spit out my dentures. Prince courted Apollonia. Anyone who would marry Vito Corleone's daughter is insane. We should only watch the Corleones from a safe distance. Godfather-in-law? Yikes.<br /><br />I have THE GODFATHER 2 and THE GODFATHER 3, but I won't get to them right away. I've heard 2 is better than 1, but I hope you understand why I'm skeptical. If you've seen 1, that is. They killed off Brando. Jeez. Great juxtaposition, dying while playing with his grandson.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>It's hard to overestimate the impact this film has had.  Others may plump for Star Wars as the most influential film of the 70s, and maybe they are right.  But I think overall The Godfather still resonates with us the most, more than 30 years later.  Such expressions as "An offer you can't refuse" and "Sleeps with fishes" are now so commonplace they don't even have to be explained anymore, nor do we think where we first learned about them.  Virtually our whole knowledge of mafia culture, our entire understanding of how the machine of organized crime works, comes from this movie (or is filtered from this movie through other movies).  So many moments of this film--the kissing of the rings, the horse's head, the baptism/massacre--have become icons of mafia films, and crime films in general.  If The Godfather had flopped, a whole score of 80s and 90s films, TV shows and even Simpsons parodies ("You bring mucha joy to this old Italian stereotype") would not have happened.<br /><br />What's hard to believe is that through much of the production, the film was believed to be in serious trouble.  Coppola's battles with the studio execs have been well-chronicled; as incredible as it may seem today, he was nearly canned in mid-production.  (Supposedly he received a telegram from the producers at one point that said, "Don't quit, make them fire you.")  One looks at the product and wonders why.  The studio was very unenthusiastic for Al Pacino as Michael--again, one looks at the tests (available on a separate supplement disc that does not come with this set, sadly) and wonders why.  They reportedly wanted someone more "out" there, more animated.  But Pacino's performance strikes me as perfectly right in how the changes come from within, from a spiritual metamorphoses we never really see, but only see the effects of.  Although Brando (another unpopular choice with the studio) received much justified attention for his role, a role that *is* remarkable, it's Michael who is the most interesting character for me, as he goes from fish out of water to mob genius in an onscreen transition that is so magnificent in its deliberate pacing.  He picks the night he visits his father at the hospital to begin Michael's transformation from family outsider to center of the Corleones.  Thus that scene is one of the most pivotal, even though it's not often discussed when one hears about great moments in The Godfather.  Similarly, his shooting of the Turk and the police captain is brilliant in the way he incorporates but does not blindly follow the advice the more experienced members of the mob family give him.  He's already, at this early stage, thinking on his own.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with the exception of Talia Shire, who I've always found to be somewhat weak and whose dialogue in the last scene had to be completely overdubbed for some reason (and whose delivery still isn't convincing).<br /><br />What makes the movie special, to me, is how this clubby world, usually presented so exotic and mysteriously, was for its participants just a "business," with hit men planning murders while their wives cook dinner and their children play in the next room.  Again, it's hard to appreciate 30+ years later how this view changed our perception of the mob world.  Prior films tended to portray gangsters as shiny-shoed polished types spouting spiffy dialogue.  This film was brave enough to show them for what they were--ordinary people, aside from what they do.<br /><br />The look of the film was equally radical for the time.  Gordon Willis--"The Price of Darkness," you either love him or hate him--likes to start with a completely black canvas and let in light and color grudgingly.  I am a fan of his very harsh, anti-Hollywood approach, even though it has since been abused by many people and occasionally even by him.  (He admits now that there were a few scenes where he overdid the darkness, and he would reshoot them today.)  The idea of giving the film a yellow tint caught on, and now so many period films have this look that I'd almost like to see it go away.  What's also interesting is how the camera is almost always very still, almost mimicking the slow, deliberate movements of the Don himself.<br /><br />It's delicious the way this film takes its time.  Editing like this is dead in this age of MTV and video equipment that allows itchy-fingered editing.  Like Chinatown, another masterpiece made around the same time by the same studio, The Godfather is in no hurry to divulge its secrets.  (Incidentally, take a look at the yellow car parked in the driveway of Woltz's mansion and compare it to Mrs. Mulwray's Packard in the Polanski film--the same prop?)  Yet, even at more than three hours in length, I actually wish the film were longer.  The sequence in Sicily feels too short and undeveloped to me.  At the same time, there's a laudable economy to the scenes, even though this is a long movie.  There's not one unnecessary moment or gesture in the film.<br /><br />It's sad, then, that Paramount seems so indifferent to this, one of a string of masterpieces they produced in the 70s.  The DVD is so lame that I have to subtract a whole star.  Actually, a more accurate rating would be the film gets five stars, while the DVD gets two-and-a-half.  The print is adequate--I've heard there are few good prints of this picture around, for some reason.  All the better reason to begin a full-blown restoration, I say.  The extras are slight--a director's commentary that is very interesting, but that's about all.  Paramout has released a complete Godfather trilogy with lots of goodies, but I don't want to be forced to buy the third film, which is a train wreck on top of a ten-car highway crash, just to get the extras.  So thumbs up to Coppola, Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan and the rest.  Thumbs down on Paramount, who can't seem to put together a compelling DVD to save their life.  Even with its flaws, though, this is a movie you can't refuse.  Bada-bang bada-bing!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Quite frankly, `The Godfather' truly is technically perfect.  In fact, it is so perfect that writing this review has been an Achilles-Heel for me.  I have wanted to write this review for a while now but have been deathly afraid of failing to do it justice.  It's a rarity to have a film this universally lauded; this universally respected and honestly there really is no other film that comes close to being as well loved and adored as `The Godfather'.  So with that, where do you go?  What do you say?  How can you begin to review a film of this magnitude?<br /><br />I'll start by saying that everything (good) that has been said about this film is true.<br /><br />I'll work from there.<br /><br />It has been said that `The Godfather' is that rare film that just feels right from beginning to end.  Every facet seems to fit just perfect, seems to flow evenly and brilliantly.  Every actor is perfect (and I do truly mean perfect) for their roles.  They melt into character and never break, always elevating the scenes they embody.  The script is tightly woven, intricate and engrossing.  The direction by Francis Ford Coppola may very well be the single greatest directive execution in the history of film making.  His delivery of this marvelous film is really what helps create its sheer presence and undeniable commanding power.  Coppola cemented himself here as one of the great directors of all time.<br /><br />The film tells the story of the Corleone family.  The family is run by the `Don' Vito Corleone.  He's an aging man, yet very respected and admired.  Known as `Godfather', Vito has much power within the organized crime families and thus is looked to often for aid and support.  When he is looked to for that support in the aid of heroin distribution on the part of the Tattaglia family, Vito finds that his higher standard of morality clashes with the direction the `underworld' is taking.  His refusal to lend aid to the Tattaglia family places the Corleone family in danger.<br /><br />This forms the catalyst for the films major plot and thus unfolds in a marvelous manor, allowing the audience to become completely and utterly absorbed in the events taking place on the screen.  As Vito's life is placed in danger and his youngest son Michael crosses over into the life he swore he'd never embrace, `The Godfather' quickly becomes the most interesting and highly entertaining film one could possible imagine.<br /><br />The performances by the entire cast are flawless, utterly flawless.  Marlon Brando effortlessly embodies Vito with such memorable charisma and temperance.  His performance is truly one of the greatest of all time.  Al Pacino delivers his finest performance ever as Michael Corleone.  This performance is of course one that he hones and perfects (his delivery in `The Godfather Part II' is truly the finest of his career) and becomes one with.  Pacino is one of those actors that I feel has suffered in recent years from lack of good source material.  Anyone new to the works of Pacino may write him off as a no talent veteran actor who stars in one worthless film after another; and judging by his recent films they would be justified in their feelings; but when you take a look at where this actor came from you will see that when he was in his prime he was truly brilliant.  James Caan is also amazing here as the hotheaded Santino (or `Sonny' as he is referred).  His performace is electric to say the least.  Robert Duval is also on the top of his game and delivers yet another flawless performance (now here is an actor who has never lost his touch) and John Cazale delivers nicely as Fredo, the `Dons' other son.  His performance in `The Godfather Part II' is much more effective and defined, but he sets a nice foundation for himself here.  Another performance that is fleshed out nicely in the sequel is that of Kay Adams, who is played by Diane Keaton.  Her performance here is subtle and short, but her character is one of the most memorable in the films that follow.<br /><br />`The Godfather' truly stands the test of time as one of the most recognizable and highly lauded films ever released.  Many critics consider this the finest movie ever filmed, and technically I feel they are correct.  There isn't a single flaw to be seen here for everything and everyone is a perfect compliment to one another.<br /><br />I don't know what more I can say without either spoiling too much of the films plot (there is a lot to be seen here, yet it never feels rushed or over-stuffed which is yet another marvelous accomplishment) or rambling on to the point of exhaustion so I'll stop here; ending by quite simply saying that `The Godfather' will leave the viewing with absolutely no regrets.  It is quite simply perfect in every way shape and form and is the pure definition of `cinema'.  This is what the movies are all about; great storytelling; and no greater story has ever been told.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I'm not sure how one can improve on this movie. The Godfather is visually stunning, the acting is exceptional, and the plot is flawless. Its three hours flow like the Mississippi and I can't think of too many films that can be watched over and over again while still managing to entertain and excite. The Godfather made the reputations of De Niro, Caan, and Pacino, but it made Brando a god among men. Unbelievable! After my tenth time renting it, I finally bought it off Amazon. I encourage you to do the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>At just under four hours, this is a long film, but one that holds the viewer riveted. Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, comes back from World War II as a hero. His family are leading mobsters and it is a life he wants to reject, but his hand is forced when his father, Don Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is shot down in the street. Slowly and reluctantly, he gets sucked into the vortex of the Mob, proving himself every bit as ruthless as his rivals.<br /><br />This film reveals perfectly the analogy between 20th Century gangsters and the aristocracy. Not the effete aristocracy of the modern age but that of antiquity: when brutality and nobility went together; when power came from brute strength. This is what Thomas Paine had to say about the aristocracy:<br /><br />"It could have been no difficult thing....for a banditti of ruffians to overrun a country [and] their power being thus established, the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of monarch and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings." 'The Rights of Man.'<br /><br />If Don Corleone had been born in the pre-democratic age, his descendants would now have lands and respectable titles. Don Corleone insists people call him Godfather: In a previous age it would have been King, Duke, Baron, or Prince. It all means the same. Splendour sits side by side with violence. There are no ethics, only power. Everything else is a fa?ade.<br /><br />This was made in the 70s, when Coppola made genuinely great films. It's a compelling story beautifully told. The pacing is steady but never slow. The performances are flawless: the cinematography beautiful. Come the 80s, his genius would desert him. However, his classic films are still around and show just how powerful a medium film can be. The Godfather is ample evidence of this. This is one of the great movies of the 20th Century.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen this fantastic movie, let me tell you that you are missing what it's perhaps the best movie of all time. It's just perfect. You just can't miss when you put together the direction of Francis Ford Coppola at the top of his game, superb performances from great actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and John Cazale, beautiful music from the composer Nino Rota, and a memorable cinematography courtesy of Gordon Willis.<p>There are a lot of timeless scenes in this mob film ("I believe in America"), plenty of quoting lines ("I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"), fabulous supporting characters (Luca Brasi), and the list can go on and on and on. In my opinion, this is the movie that beats all the rest of the films. I think that all movie fan collection must include "The Godfather". If you haven't seen it yet and you are looking for a fantastic film, go see a classic film, go see "The Godfather".<p>Absolutely recommendable.</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>There is nothing more important than your Family....

Those images, saved in a backlog file in my brain, never really inspired me to rent this film. However, recent conversations led to me purchasing this movie and viewing it with Rapt Attention! I had no idea! The TV commercials for the movie did not do it justice. I thought it would be a long, slow, boring flick that you just sit-through to say you have seen it. WRONG ! This movie is Action-packed, from beginning to end! I had to rewind scenes and watch them Twice! Could Anyone have played The Godfather, other-than Brando (and, later, DeNiro)? I cannot imagine anyone-else playing this role.... Another review said that these people were born to play these parts. I agree. You will get lines stuck in your head, that you cannot unthink: &quot;Leave the Gun....Take the Cannoli.&quot; You will also understand movies like &quot;Robinhood, Men in Tights.&quot; I've watched that movie twice, never understanding the Dom DeLouise scene, until I watched The Godfather. This movie is not-only a Classic, it is an EXCITING Classic. Please, do not make my mistake, though! Get them ALL, before you start watching them! If you only get Godfather I, you will feel strangely compelled to run for the local video store, when the movie ends. Pile them all up and make a weekend of it.

This series is definitely on my &quot;Top Ten&quot; List!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Sofia Coppola, who plays Michael Corleone's daughter in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y08NI">THE GODFATHER Part III</a>, is in this original picture the infant son of Connie (Talia Shire) who's being baptised during the picture's final bloodbath.

"The Godfather" is one of those movies. In general, I do not like Mafia movies, and as a result, I felt certain that I would hate this movie, and yet, within the first 15 minutes of starting this film, I found myself drawn into the saga of the Corleone family.<br /><br />It is virtually impossible to find fault with "The Godfather". Everything about it is perfect, from the script, to the acting, to the directing. Some negative reviewers have called this film boring, and I will admit that this film is slow moving, but slow moving does not translate into boredom. The pacing of this film is perfect for what it is and it allows the viewer to become fully acquainted with each and every member of the Corleone clan. The only factor that I would say could possibly prevent someone from watching and enjoying this film is the violence. Back in 1972, "The Godfather" was considered to be extremely violent, and even by 21st century standards, the violence is still intense and likely to distress some viewers.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can think of about "The Godfather" is the unfortunate timing of its release. "The Godfather" was released in the same year as "Cabaret", another great film, resulting in the Academy Awards for that year being split between the two films ("The Godfather" got Best Picture and Best Actor, while "Cabaret" got Best Director, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor). Both of these films are so good that they deserve all of the above mentioned Oscars (well, with the possible exception of Best Actress, since there was no lead actress in "The Godfather"), and I just wish that they could have been released in separate years so that they could have achieved just that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>This has been, and still is, one of my all time favorite movies.  I don't think any mob movie can compare.  I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story of the Corleone family's struggle for complete power.  All of the characters are so well done, especially Michael, played by Al Pacino.  This movie is very well done, setting the scene from the 1950 up until the 1970's.  This is a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER (1972) may be the best movie ever made that no one in my family wants to borrow from my large private DVD collection.  They say it is too long  (it really isn't) and much too violent (it is).  Ironically, the graphic violence may be one reason we have the version of THE GODFATHER that gangster film devotees love so much.  Listen to the illuminating commentary by Coppola on the DVD.  He was young and constantly under pressure from Paramount executives to shoot the movie faster and make it more violent, or face firing.  The exquisite wedding sequence in reel one is a good example--executives demanded it be filmed in three days or else, so scenes with Al Pacino and Diane Keaton talking at a side table were shot at night with tons of light to look like daytime and to cinematographer Gordon Willis' justified anger as a perfectionist.  And a later scene with Talia Shire getting beaten up by her husband was shot by Coppola with the fear of being replaced if he did not add more violence to the movie.<br /><br />It was a low-budget film ($2.5 million) that blossomed up to $6.5 million.  The Hollywood exterior scenes with John Marley were done with long shot doubles and a second unit crew.  (But the infamous horse's head in bed scene WAS done by Coppola in New York.)  Ironically, the first week of filming went very smoothly and included two full nights to film the killing of the violent police captain (Sterling Hayden) and his henchman in the restaurant.  In any event, the first GODFATHER film was a very hard movie to make.  Producer Robert Evans, coming off LOVE STORY, even wanted to replace Nino Rota's incomparably lovely score with something more schmaltzy, until an enthusiastic public screening of the movie convinced him to stay with Rota.<br /><br />At 175 minutes, THE GODFATHER a towering gangster film achievement with flawless performances and solid writing.  (The studio executives were so brutal to Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role that he refused to come back for the 1974 sequel, even for just a cameo.  And the "shirts" also were not very keen on Al Pacino as Michael, not even after the restaurant massacre in week one.)  Note the plotting and the way light and dark contrast--not just dramatically, but also visually.  Take the opening reel and the way undertaker Bonasera is talking to Vito Corleone (Brando, and an improvised cat to stroke as he talked) in a darkened study, all golds and browns, while a gorgeous sun-lit wedding reception for Vito's daughter is taking place outside.  The whole movie has juxtapositions like this to make it a special gangster film.  All the way to the last reel, where the baptism of Michael's infant son (really baby Sofia Coppola!) in a cathedral is intercut with terrible murders happening all over greater New York City.<br /><br />Dean Tavoularis' production design and Anna Hill Johnstone's costumes deserve special mention in their extraordinary detail, especially the shops in Little Italy and just the right clothes for everyone on the sidewalks and in the streets.  Their work is magnificent.<br /><br />And I love the Sicily scenes with Al Pacino's Michael hiding out for a couple of years after killing the police captain in the New York restaurant.  Michael falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian bride, with Nino Rota's exquisite "Love Theme" music on the soundtrack.  Their evocative wedding will contrast against the bride being subsequently blown up in a car, which sends Michael back home to Diane Keaton's nurturing Kay.<br /><br />I also love a later scene that a moron Paramount executive wanted cut out because it allegedly did not advance the plot--the death of Brando's Vito Corleone of a heart attack while playing in a tomato vineyard with his young son.  Fortunately, this classic scene stayed in and adds great beauty on either side of darker scenes.  In fact, Coppola says on the audio commentary that Robert Evans eventually came to his rescue when Evans saw that he had a potential masterpiece and blockbuster on his hands--Evans insisted that scene after scene be put back into a movie that was originally about two hours and slowly creeped up to its present 175 minutes.  Hollywood moviemaking is a crapshoot and a crazy, stressful game.  God must have been looking down on the 30 year old director and co-writer more than a few times.<br /><br />In the final analysis, it is the constant blending of romance and violence, both dramatically and visually, that makes THE GODFATHER such a special gangster film masterpiece.  It blends flawless acting, strong writing, authoritative direction, world-class sets and costumes, magnificent (and very underrated) photography, and the loveliest of lovely music scores to be one of the great works of art of the American cinema.  Now if only I could get my own family to watch my DVD of it and its even better 1974 sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>Francis Ford Coppola does something with this movie many filmmakers are  unable to do. Coppola makes us feel as if we're part of  the&quot;FAMILY&quot;. We feel as if were behind the scenes watching the  Corleone's up's and down's. A one of a kind screenplay written by Mario  Puzo and Coppola,and as we all should know by now,the film the based on  Puzo's novel. Truly desevering of the Oscars in won. Brando's performance  in this movie,is in my opinion,the best of his career. And the same goes  with the rest of the cast:Al Pacino,Diane Keaton,James Caan,Robert  Duvall,and Talia Shire. Everyone in this movie delivers a powerhouse  performances. Many unforgettable lines and characters that will stay with  us forever. Terrific music score by Nino Rota,beautiful camerawork by  Gordon Willis,and top notch directing Coppola. Truly one of the greatest  films ever made! If there's anyone who hasn't seen this movie,you have no  idea what your missing. A must for anyone's video collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>The GODFATHER DVD<br /><br />The God father is based upon Mario Puzo's novel of a Sicilian Family moved to the United States circa 1920's.  Don Corleone goes into the  olive oil business, what else would you expect?  He soon learns that it is easier to make money on the wrong side of the law and recruits a small gang of fellow Sicilians.<br /><br />A host of factors make this one of the greatest American films. First, the directing is impeccable. Coppola allows the story to unfold simply, employing for the most part a static, immobile camera, allowing each scene to unfold like a series of tableaux. Second, the cinematography. Most of the craft of the cinematography went into the lighting, which generates some of the greatest use of light and shadows since the demise of black and white film noir. Coppola also intensifies each scene by using surprisingly little music in the film. Although the film is famous for its outstanding score by Nina Rota (later discovered to have been partially reused from an obscure film he scored in the late 1950s in Italy, which led to his nomination for an Oscar to be withdrawn, an award he certainly would have won), the fact is that the music is used selectively and comparatively rarely. Silence engulfs most of the scenes. And although there are many famous lines in the film, it is driven as much by the silence between the characters as by what they say. Also accounting for the brilliance of the film is the script, which is brilliant for its simplicity. Coppola distills the tale down to only the most essential elements, with nearly every shot moving the story along or imparting a crucial piece of information to the viewer, allowing the crucial tensions of the story to unfold early on. The enormous simplicity in the telling of the tale makes the more complex moments for instance, the crosscutting during the baptismal scene all that much more effective. And any listing of all the reasons for the brilliance of the film leaving out the extraordinary art design would be woefully incomplete. This was one of the first films made that made historical accuracy a high art form, and has exerted a profound influence on any historical film since then.<br />Of course, one of the main reasons this is a great, great film is the acting. Few films have ever featured so many memorable performances, and no film had featured so many performances by so many actors who were explicitly Italian. In fact, the film was a  coming out  for one aspect of Italian culture in the United States. Even in films that were fairly transparently about the Mafia and crime families in New York and Chicago, ethnicity was completely left out of the picture. After THE GODFATHER, everything changed. The film was Marlon Brando s triumphant return to star status after a series of failures, garnering a well-served Oscar that he turned down. The quality of the acting is shown by the fact that no less than three of the other actors Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan received nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Joel Grey won for CABERET, in what might have been the greatest group of performances in the history of Oscar for the award).<br />There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER. My favorite, and one of the happier accidents in casting history, was that originally Robert De Niro was cast in a small part in THE GODFATHER. Al Pacino, on the other hand, was wanted for the part of Michael Corleone, but was already obligated for the film BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY. Francis Ford Coppola worked out a deal whereby De Niro would replace Pacino in the one picture. Unfortunately/fortunately this meant that De Niro was unable to be in THE GODFATHER, which meant that he was free to appear in THE GODFATHER II as the young Vito Corleone. THE GODFATHER was a film where just about everything seemed to work out best for all involved, and this illustrates this perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Al Pacino, Marlan Brando et. al.and fans of organized crime in America<br /><br />Gunner  January 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>This is one for the time capsule.<br /><br />It seems to look better every year. The performances are stunningly good (Brando, Pacino, Duvall, and Caan were all Oscar-worthy here), the script a genius retelling of the epic novel, and Coppola knocks it out of the park with his flawless eye for framing emotions.<br /><br />Inspired in every sense of the word, The Godfather is peerless, except for Godfather 2, which is somehow almost as good (and where Pacino enters the Pantheon).<br /><br />The music, the colors, the darkness and chiaroscuro, the overall feeling of being in the midst of greatness on every level...this is what moviemaking can be. The bar was raised with this one, and in some ways only Apocalypse Now has topped it since.<br /><br />Coming on the heels of Coppola's incredibly dull The Conversation, this film seems even more miraculous. G 1, G 2, and Apocalypse, all in less than eight years; how many directors have had a hat trick like that?</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I can't believe it's taken me this long to see 'The Godfather' but now that I've finished I feel complete in a way, like I've acomplished something.  I guess that may be that up until this point I didn't know why so many people LOVE this film, and now that I have experianced it I can agree with the masses that you rarely watch a film as COMPLETE as 'The Godfather'.  By that statement I mean that, from start to finish, every line spoken, every scene shot, every moment caught on film feels just right.  Nothing feels contrived or forced, nothing feels out of place or 'added' but everything feels natural and, well, perfect.  Now I really don't know what to say...I mean, how do you review a masterpiece.  It almost feels wrong to say anything but "see this movie if you haven't already" for fear that something you say will take away from the film, but I will try my best.  First of all the story is classic, and no, I have not read Puzi's novel, but I have decided to order it and will read it shortly, but the story regardless if you've read the novel is still gripping.  Marlon Brando, in his most critically aclaimed role, plays 'Don' Vito Corleone, the head of his mafia family.  The story follows as the Don is asked by the Tattaglia family for his aid in trafficing narcotics throughout New York.  Now Vito is a man of the old country, and he believes narcotics to be a dirty business and so he refuses, politely, to aid the family.  This causes problems, and after the Don is attacked and hospitalized his family struggles to exact their revenge while taking care of the responcibilities their father can no longer tend to.  Vito's son's all take seperate approaches to the crime.  Sonny (James Caan) is hotheaded and placed in charge in his father absence.  He wants to strike while the iron is hot sort-a-speak.  Tom Hagen, the Corleone adopted son (Robert Duvall) is the sensable consultant to the family (and family lawyer) and he advises Sonny to take his time and think things through.  If he strikes fast and hard he may bring upon them the vengence of the other mafia family's.  Michael (Al Pucino) is the youngest son, and up until this time he had nothing to do with the family business, and he had no desire to get involved.  He has just returned from war and is courting Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), but when his fathers life is placed on the line he has a change on heart and exacts his revenge on the Tattaglia's resulting in a feud or war between the family's and causes Michael to flee to Sicily for his safty.  Events take place over the years that take a toll on the family, but the strength of the Corleone's pulls through and by the end of the film, as Michael realizes his place in the world and becomes the new 'Don' we, the viewer, understand the importance of this film and the power it holds.  From beginning to end there is only perfection.  I can't say anything more, and quite frankly I shouldn't have to.  Watch this movie for there is no film that even comes close to this film...probably the most deserving film to ever walk away with the top honors at the oscars.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>I hate saying this but I learned more about life from this film than I did while attending High School at the same time. Maybe because I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer but every time I see this film I find something new in it. A first rate film and I just wish that Hollywood could make more films of this high a quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>American movies aren't always terrific, and sometimes they are pretty bad, but this one is one of the greatest movies ever made.  The quality shines through from beginning to end.  The script, the directing and the acting are all outstanding.  Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is the finest work he ever did, and may be the finest work any actor ever did.  He doesn't stand alone.  The rest of the cast is tremendous as well.<br /><br />There is one obvious fault in the movie.  It idealizes the Mafia.  With such a glorious example of a mafia don as Vito Corleone, we are given the impression that the Mafia is made up of brilliant and sensitive heroes, at least in this one character.<br /><br />From the first scene, Connie's wedding, where the don grants justice to Bona Sera for his daughter's vicious assault, the Marlon Brando character stands about as tall as Lincoln.  I really wouldn't expect to find a man that amazing.  I'd expect to find greedy selfish violent men running the Mafia, not wonderful men like Corleone.<br /><br />That's my only criticism.  The story is beautifully crafted.<br /><br />Oh wait, one more criticism.  I think that Michael should have leveled with Kay at the end.  He had ample reason for his decision, and she would have understood and, if not approved, at least considered staying with him through the years.  Cutting her out as he did, with a lie and a dismissal, makes for a neat ending but not, perhaps, the best or even the most realistic ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>Since the 1972 release of "The Godfather", it has been hailed by many critics as one of the top ten greatest films ever made.  This film proved to be only the beginning in this triumphant history making.  It received ten Oscar nominations, winning only three (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor [Marlon Brando refused]).  It's proceeded with two sequels that either match or beat the quality of the original.  While most film sequels don't match even closely to its original, this trilogy has stood against the test of time.  This film has since influenced many filmmakers that have since come.<br /><br />"The Godfather" follows the lives of the Corleone family, one who commits organized crime.  Vito Corleone, the family leader, is slowly losing his health due to old age.  His struggle to create peace within the rival families is growing harder because of major recent conflicts.  People are continually get murdered.  The Corleone family must protect and love one another more urgently to assure the safety.  Meanwhile, this follows the rising power of Michael Corleone, who becomes better known through the remaining trilogy.  The eyeopening series of events ready audiences for the triumphant sequel.<br /><br />Director and writer Francis Ford Coppola leads the cast and crew to create this amazing masterpiece.  He pays great homage to the novel of the same name written by Mario Puzo, who assisted in writing this screenplay.  The maintained emotional stance allows room to explore themes beyond organized crime.  Themes of family, love, protection, and italian pride fit wonderfully within the film.  Amazingly, this film doesn't portray the Corleone family as either good or evil.  Despite the crimes committed by them, the powerful stance never loses its edge.  Throughout, the film's passion that keeps audiences watching remains intact.<br /><br />The physical backgrounds give accurate and great additions to this film.  Through the buildings to the wardrobes, it feels like actual 1940's living.  The research proves revalent with its obvious hard work.  Its level of greatness presents itself as more than elaborate backgrounds.  Audiences can sense the individual themes through these physical beings, namely italian pride and organized crime.  The use of color and their tones matches well with the film.<br /><br />Everytime the music is heard, one thought arises to the listeners: "The Godfather".  The type of music is always played in the perfect scenes to match with the events.  Two versions of the main theme are presented: the orchestral and the italian-based.  It begins with a long trumpet solo, no instruments backing it.  Then it changes to the chorus played by the woodwinds.  Afterwards, it plays various melodies with various instruments.  Then the chorus repeats itself but more intensely and with string instruments.  The other songs also present themselves wonderfully, though not as well-known.<br /><br />"The Godfather" stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and John Cazale.  This amazing cast makes this film them much more powerful.  Audiences could not possible ask for better.  Pacino, Caan, and Duvall also received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor.  This is one of few times in Oscar history that three actors from the same film are nominated for the same catagory.  None are more deserving than these three with their fine performances.  Brando states his performance the heaviest by developing an old-man italian accent for his role as Vito Corleone.  His expressions match well with Vito's personality and his health/ emotions.<br /><br />Such tremendous film quality makes "The Godfather" deserving of its title as a classic.  This is sure to please many audiences for many more years.  Those who like this film should also watch the two sequels.  Those interested in them must watch this edition first.  Otherwise, the events will be confusing.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Godfather was nominated for an additional eight. The brainchild of celebrated author Mario Puzo, the film is considered the crowning achievement of Francis Ford Coppola's directing career. Providing audiences with a glimpse into the notorious underworld of warring New York crime families, The Godfather catapulted a number of actors into fame's limelight, among them - James Caan, Al Pacino, and Robert Duvall (all three nominated for Best Supporting Actor). In addition, Marlon Brando turns in, arguably, the most memorable performance of his career. Certainly among the top five films of all time, the case could be made that The Godfather is the most perfect movie ever produced...<br /><br />The film opens as "Don" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) hosts his daughter's wedding, entertaining friends and business associates. Vito's favorite son Michael (Al Pacino) has come home from the war, and he's determined to do something different with his life other than joining the family business. Idealistic at heart, the young Michael inspires his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) with tales of the fine and outstanding things he will do with his life. Through the eyes of Michael, the audience learns of the family's various business methods and the hierarchy of its system. Vito's eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is the heir apparent to his father's empire. Middle son Fredo (John Cazale) performs his part in the business, but few consider him a possible successor. Providing legal council to the family is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), a long-time friend of the family who Michael treats as a brother.<br /><br />Things are well for the Corleone family until Vito is approached by opportunistic newcomer Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) wishing to sell drugs on the street. He asks for the Don's blessing so he can expand his operations. But Vito sees a big difference between gambling and prostitution and drug running on school playgrounds and family neighborhoods. The Don's preference for placing family above all else conflicts with the changing times.<br /><br />When competing crime families are more accommodating to Sollozzo's business proposal, the enterprise sparks a bloody war between the crime families which quickly leads to the murder of Sonny Corleone. Vito attempts to end the conflict in its early stages, but an attempt is made on his life as well.<br /><br />Avenging his brother's death, Michael carries out a hit on two men in an Italian restaurant. Afterward, he hides out for several months in Sicily where he marries a beautiful village girl. But she dies from a car bomb shortly thereafter - a car bomb intended for Michael.<br /><br />With the battle for crime syndicate supremacy in full swing, Michael is forced to fill the vacuum created by his brother Sonny's death. As his father reaches the end of his life, Michael is groomed as his replacement. When Vito finally dies of a heart attack, Michael lets his presence be known in direct fashion. All enemies of the Corleone family are eliminated in a single bloody hour. And with Kay as his new wife, Michael follows in his father's footsteps as the latest incarnation of Don Corleone...<br /><br />A dramatic story of family and change, of the idealism of youth and the pragmatism of adulthood, The Godfather stands alone as the greatest mafia film ever produced - and perhaps as the best drama in history. Al Pacino's masterful performance would soon be replicated in The Godfather II and countless other films in the decades since, cementing his place among Hollywood legends. Widely heralded as one of the best written and best directed films in history, The Godfather is a must-see film for any serious cinema aficionado...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'The Godfather' is one of the few films that's got it all.  It has great acting, characters, editing, storytelling, dialogue, actors, scenery, and ending.  Watch it and you will find yourself going back and watching it again and again.  You will discover new things about the movie you didn't notice before and enjoy like never before.  A true classic and one of the best films ever made.  This DVD includes commentary by Francis Ford Coopola, the director of the movie; some of it is interesting, but most of it boring.</p></br></body></html>

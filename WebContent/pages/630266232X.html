From the stark, stylized  chiaroscuro cinematography, which won it an Academy Award in 1944,  to its stellar performances, deft direction, and  intelligent screenplay, it is simply a marvelous film. It was adapted from the novel of the same name by Vera Caspary. To add icing to the cake, there is a haunting musical score that will stay with the viewer long after the final credits have scrolled away.<br /><br />This classic, old-fashioned  murder mystery features a stunning Gene Tierney in the title role and old time favorite Dana Andrews as Detective Lt. Mark McPherson, the hardboiled, virile gumshoe who finds himself smitten the minute he sees the portrait of Laura Hunt at the scene of the crime. He is determined to bring the murderer of this lovely young woman to justice. As have all the men in Laura's life, McPherson, too, becomes obsessed with her.<br /><br />When a major, mind-boggling twist in the plot casts a new light on the evidence,  McPherson goes full speed ahead, as new developments point the finger of suspicion from the least likely to the most likely suspect. Could it be Laura's jealous aunt, Ann Treadwell (Dame Judith Anderson), who seems to be hot to trot with Laura's fiance, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), despite the differences in their respective ages? Could it be Laura's playboy fiance? After all, he has a shady past and a penchant for money and other women, especially those who could keep him in the style to which he would like to become accustomed. Could it even be Laura's long time friend, mentor,  and spurned would be suitor, the acerbic writer and self-styled cynic,  Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb)?<br /><br />Gene Tierney gives a luminous performance as Laura Hunt, the beautiful, intelligent, independent businesswoman who is somewhat of a cipher. She is someone to whom men are drawn, often obsessively so. Dana Andrews is perfect in the role of Detective McPherson. His no nonsense, street smart, hunky detective is a great counterpoint and foil to the more effete and prissy Waldo Lydecker. Clifton Webb is positively brilliant in the role of Waldo Lydecker and steals the show from under the noses of his co-stars. This is no mean feat given the enormous talent of the film's stellar cast. Webb's droll, spot on delivery of the wonderful lines that he was given are memorable.<br /><br />Vincent Price is excellent in the role of Shelby Carpenter, Laura's Callow fiance and erstwhile gigolo. At first, however, he took a little getting used to, as I was used to seeing Vincent Price in roles associated with gothic horror. Still, he acquits himself admirably. Dame Judith Anderson is memorable in the small role of Laura's desperate aunt, Ann Treadwell,  who knows what she wants and will pay whatever price is necessary to get it. Of course, Otto Preminger deserves kudos for his deft direction, as does Samuel Hoffenstein for writing a screenplay infused with such great dialogue. Kudos also go to David Raskin, as his memorable score will forever be loved and remembered by those who enjoy this film.<br /><br />As for the DVD, since I paid what seemed to be a rock bottom price for it, I assumed that it would be problematic in terms of quality. Instead, I got a wonderful DVD with an excellent print transfer, as both the visuals and the audio were clear and of good quality. The DVD is also loaded with extras that are unheard of in a DVD of this price. There are two worthwhile commentaries provided. There are also two versions of  the film to view. One is an extended version that contains an alternate opening scene. The DVD also contains two great A & E  biographies. One is of Gene Tierney, and  that other is of Vincent Price. Both will be of interest to all film buffs. This DVD has got to be one of the best values to be found on Amazon, and the film is certainly one that is worthy of a place in one's personal film collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>With a well-rounded cast, Oscar winning cinematography and a beautiful but haunting music score, Laura is one of the best  film noirs ever made, a definite classic (Possible plot spoilers ahead). <p>Laura Hunt (A beautiful Gene Tierney) is a manager at an advertisement agency. Famous, talented and of course attractive, she is adored and respected by everyone. But when she is murdered, everyone who was close to her is suspected. Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (A dull but effective Dana Andrews) is put on the case. Throughout the film, we are given the impression that McPherson doesn't think too well of women, referring to them as `Dames' or `Dolls'. As he delves further, he finds he falling in love with Laura's portrait. As it turns out, Laura is very much alive. The problem now is for McPherson to find out who was murdered and, more importantly, who was the murderer.  <p>Clifton Webb gave the film's best performance as columnist/ writer Waldo Lydecker  (Murder is his favorite subject). He never admits it, but seems to be in love with Laura. He has given her many gifts and gave her the boost to become the success that she was. He also believes that only he is right for her, though considerably beyond her age. But maybe Laura just was using and manipulating him to rise to the top. Waldo never seems to believe this and prevents Laura from having other relationships with men. He also is a smart alec, claiming that he writes not with a pen, but "...with a Goose Quill, dipped in venom". He is definitely the most colorful character in the movie and got an Oscar nomination for his work. <p>What ever you do, don't give away the ending. It is revealed who the murderer was. It is both the most likely and the least likely suspect. But it doesn't matter who it is, really. For this is still a must see movie. It's also, for the MTV generation people, rather short (88 Minutes). <p>Since this movie is not yet out on DVD, fans will have to go with the VHS edition, which includes the Original Theatrical Trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>Laura is played by Gene Tierney, a lady with a compelling personality and the embodiment of unattainable beauty.<br /><br />In "Laura" she plays a Park Avenue advertising executive and becomes introduced to Waldo Lydecker as a potential source to endorse customer products. The film is set in New York City among the most elegant and sophisticated office, apartment and restaurant scenes.<br /><br />Albeit, the opening scenes reveal that Laura is dead, and a police detective, played by Dana Andrews, investigates the crime. The single most important clue is that all the men in Laura's life were in love with her, and that includes Waldo (Clifton Webb), a powerful radio commentator that eventually tried to lure Laura with his influence and charm her with worldly possessions. Vincent Price was in love with Laura too, but we learn that he quite regularly falls in love, since he is broke, unable to stoop to a job, so requires the company of at least a working girl.<br /><br />This movie is a well made romantic drama, a film noir in its day and even until now has the strength to entertain well. Shock scenes build the suspense as the conclusion comes with a surprise. And I will  not spoil it!<br /><br />The theme music "Laura" was very popular and remains so to this day.<br /><br />A great movie and treasured ever since I first saw it as a school boy in a local theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>You can't go wrong with this film, the story of a police detective who falls in love with a murdered girl.  Yes, it is a murder mystery -- who killed Laura?  And we have some really good suspects.  But the big question of this movie is: How is Hollywood going to give this movie a Hollywood ending, when Laura is dead?  Is our poor lamenting police detective going to drink himself into rehab?  Quit the police department?  Kill himself?  This movie keeps you guessing to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>"Laura" is a murder mystery which contains one of the best and most surprising plot twists ever. I don't want to go into any more detail about the plot, as it might spoil it for you. I saw this film for the first time, on late night television, about 20 years ago and have seen it numerous times since. I consider it to be among my favourite films of all time. It is not just the plot twists that makes it a great film, but also the characters and the actors who play them: the arrogant and sarcastic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), who is one of my family's favourite fictitious characters; and the enigmatic Laura (Gene Tierney) who might not be as nice as she initially appears.<br /><br />"Laura" is based on a book by Vera Caspary, which I also highly recommend. The movie follows the book reasonably closely, but in a number of ways improves on the book. I see the movie as being a darker version of its source material.<br /><br />This is one of the lesser known film noir films, but is by no means lesser in quality or entertainment value. I highly recommend this film to any fans of the noir genre or to fans of mysteries in general.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>I guess if you get into a crime noir crazed mode as I have been over the past several months then nothing should surprise you as far as plot line, photography (black and white of course), or actors are concerned. Recently I reviewed a film noir , Where The Sidewalk Ends, that no way, no way in hell,  when I started out this jail break-out reviewing process of the old time films from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s did I figure to be reviewing. Except that film with its line-up, as here, of Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney and director Otto Preminger got me thinking about Laura. From the plot line it appears that I was not alone in thinking of her and I will just have to stand in line until she tires of  whoever is next in line to get tired of.<br /><br /> Additionally, there  is no way, no way in hell,  I would  have believed that I would be, seemingly endlessly now, on a Dana Andrews run. Bogie, no question, Robert Mitchum sure, even Dick Powell in a pinch but Dana Andrews? Oh well, at least he has classic good girl (no femme fatale here she is hard-working  career women in advertising) Gene Tierney to keep his eyes on once he gets control of his emotions (and lays off the bottle).<br /><br />But enough of that. This is a  story with great arch dialogue ( if somewhat dated for today's audiences) although I am sure some would argue that it is not really a noir but more a little Thin Man series mystery comedy fluff whatever.  In any case every guy in New York, every guy with eyes anyway and maybe even guys who don't see so well, has a bee-line straight for Laura (played of course by Gene Tierney). Even a guy, a police detective (played by seemingly perennial cop Dana Andrews)  who has never met her and is only "interested" in her because she has been murdered ( a little anyway, if there is such a thing) and as a good methodical, if somewhat blas&eacute;, cop he has to put the pieces together and see if they fit. In short, who done it.<br /><br />Wait in line, brothers and sisters. It could have been half the women in NewYork, well, upper-side New York anyway jealous of Laura' charms (and tired of their companions' head-turns). It could have been half the guys in New York who never had a chance at her. But let's narrow the field a little. Narrow it to her cash-strapped gigalo fianc&eacute; Shelby (played by a very young Vincent Price) and Laura's older gentleman friend (I am being polite as they were then) Waldo (played by Clifton Webb), the great society newspaper writer , who introduced Laura to upper-crust New York society. Of course Waldo has this little problem, this little homicidal  problem about his affections for Laura and that's what drives the twist and turns of the film. As for our good guy detective well for his efforts, in the end, he gets the girl. Natch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>It's hard to create an absent character, then feature them front-and-center without destroying all that mystery and power. Just look at "Rebecca."<br /><br />But one exception to this rule is "Laura," a spellbinding film noir about a rough, clever detective and a society girl suspected of being first the victim, then the murderer. Dark atmosphere, red herrings, and a hefty dose of psychology are all part of the mix in one of Hollywood's strangest love triangles.<br /><br />A young socialite, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been shot in the face with buckshot. Det. Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is sent on the case, investigating Laura's aunt, her gigolo fiancee Shelby (Vincent Price), and her best friend, an acid-tongued gay columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). No one seems to have a motive for killing Laura -- everyone loved her.<br /><br />And soon McPherson starts to fall in love with Laura too, with a painting as his guide. Then Laura walks into her apartment, alive and well. Now MacPherson must find out who the dead girl was, and struggles with his jealousy when Laura reunites with her cheating fiancee. But who was the real target -- and what twisted motives do they have?<br /><br />Few murder mysteries of any kind are as tight and perfectly plotted as "Laura" is, and few noirs have as deep an insight into the human mind -- and just how strange and/or twisted love can become. Not many movies can have a guy who falls in love with a girl through a painting, without making it corny.<br /><br />The movie is taut, intense and slightly overwhelming, with a twist in the middle that throws out all the previous suspicions. It unwinds slowly throughout the film, with the occasional burst of action (MacPherson punching Shelby), right up to an action-packed finale, full with symbolism... and some seriously twisted motives.<br /><br />But atmosphere alone isn't enough, and there's also some incredibly haunting cinematography and brilliant dialogue ("I don't use a pen. I write with a goose quill dipped in venom"). When MacPherson interviews Laura's maid, she announces, "I ain't afraid of cops. I was brought up to spit whenever I saw one." His reply? "Okay, go ahead and spit if that'll make you feel better."<br /><br />Laura's a powerful presence in the first half, and a less talented actress would have wrecked the atmosphere, but Tierney handles it well. Andrews has a crackling Bogart-esque presence here, which makes us like the only honest guy in the movie, and Webb is brilliant as the tart-tongued, frustrated Waldo, who sees Laura as his personal Galatea. And Price has a small but juicy role as a smooth gigolo.<br /><br />"Laura" is one of the greatest films noir, full of wonderful acting, dark atmosphere and twisted passion. It's nothing short of brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>Otto Preminger directs this 1944 noir thriller starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  Dana Andrews plays McPherson, the hard-boiled detective investigating the shocking murder of a society woman, Laura, in New York.  McPherson focuses on Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a sardonic sophisticate who writes a newspaper column and has a radio talk show.  Lydecker was a good friend of Laura's but despised her playboy fiancee Shelby (Vincent Price). In  process of the investigation McPherson falls in love with Laura's portrait.  Fortunately for McPherson, Laura returns--apparently the body of the girl found in the apartment was not Laura!<br /><br />The filming of this story is gorgeous black and white with cunningly utlized shadow that threatens the characters--or reveals their underlying motivation.  Dana Andrews' curt and athletic interpretation of the detective contrasts nicely with the talented Vincent Price who plays a spoiled rich boy. Clifton Webb does a nice job as the poisonous, dried-out sophisticate.  Gene Tierney as Laura is gorgeous, charming and elegant.  Unfortunately her character weakens rather than strengthens throughout the film.  Laura starts out as an assertive individualist who challenges the values of sophisticated society. By the end of the film she is a docile female who has found her man.  The story is a little melodramatic, and all the loose ends are tied up too neatly--a good noir thriller leaves some mysteries unsolved.  Also, the theme song is a little saccharine and too often played.  Nevertheless well worth seeing and enjoying.</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>LAURA remains the definitive masterpiece of the noir genre.  Gene Tierney is perfectly-cast in the title role, a mysterious young society debutante who gets caught up in a dizzying murder plot.  When a body is discovered maimed by bullets in Laura's apartment, it's naturally assumed that Laura herself is the corpse.  Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) sets about interviewing all of Laura's friends in the hopes of discovering whether Laura's death might have been foul play or suicide.  Mark grows increasingly obsessed with the elusive Laura thanks to her portrait, and gets the shock of his life when the girl herself enters her apartment, following a restful vacation.  Now Mark must discover who the real murder victim was, and how Laura fits into the puzzle.  The outstanding cast also includes Clifton Webb, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson and Grant Mitchell.  The score is highlighted by David Raskin's unforgettable "Theme for Laura".<br /><br />LAURA is a true masterpiece, and this new DVD showcases the film accordingly with a smart assortment of bonus features.  Including two complete Biography episodes "Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait" and "Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain", along with audio commentary (composer David Raskin and film historian/critic Jeanine Basinger) in addition to a second commentary track with film historian Rudy Behlmer, and a deleted scene (again with Behlmer's comments).</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Otto Preminger's film noir "Laura" is a taut, stylish murder mystery featuring a talented and well directed cast.<br /><br />Hard boiled police detective Lt. Mark McPherson played by a tough talking Dana Andrews is investigating the brutal shotgun murder of Laura Hunt.  Hunt, a socialite and high powered advertising executive is played by a glamorous and confident Gene Tierney.  The film commences with Andrews interviewing the unquestioned star of the show, Clifton Webb, playing the celebrated yet cantakerous and acerbic critic Waldo Lydecker. Lydecker through his influence and contacts has elevated Laura from the stenography pool up the ranks in both her industry and society.  He was deeply in love with her and insanely jealous.<br /><br />Lydecker felt threatened when playboy Shelby Carpenter played by an oily Vincent Price moved in on Laura using his smooth Southern charm.  They soon announced their engagement to marry which was short circuited by her death.<br /><br />Andrews spending time in the murdered girl's apartment looking for clues finds himself becoming enamored with Tierney's portrait.  The plot takes an unexpected twist when Laura returns home after being away in the country to contemplate her potential betrothal and confronts Andrews.  Evidently someone else had been murdered but who and by whom?<br /><br />The major flaw in this otherwise memorable flick was the very obvious identity of the murderer.  The musical score was an excellent enhancement to the haunting mood of the movie.  Judith Anderson playing Ann Treadwell, a middle aged society woman in love with and bankrolling the seamy Price also was very good in her supporting role.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>Once again, PBS shows another great film. "Laura" was on, and I had been wanting to see it for awhile as I had loved Gene Tierney in "Leave her to Heaven".<br />Gene Tierney, who I think is the most beautiful woman to ever grace the movie screen, plays Laura Hunt.  Laura works for an advertising agency, and she works her way up to the top of the corporate ladder just barely hitting the glass ceiling.<br />While working on a new sponsor for a new product, she meets Waldo Lydecker(what a great character name!), played by Clifton Webb.  Who, by the way, is outstanding in this movie!  What a performance!  Her relationship with Mr. Lydecker is strictly platonic, at least she thinks it is. Waldo has other plans.<br />He falls for her hard and stalks her.  He goes so far as to kill her!  or does he?<br />The whole film is told in narration by Waldo, and after the supposed death of Laura.  He tells the story of how they met and about their relationship to us and to Lt. Mark Macpherson(and we see it all unfold on screen), played by Dana Andrews, who also turns in a great performance.<br />Macpherson gets into Laura's apartment and starts snooping around to find information.  There is a portrait of her hanging over the fireplace, and it is so engaging that he falls in love with her just from glaring at it for so long.<br />Vincent Price played lead romantic male roles before turning to the "House of Wax" and other old horror movie.  He plays Shelby Carpenter, one of the other men who become entranced by Laura's beauty.<br />The movie is classic film noir.  Filmed in black and white, it still makes Gene Tierney look so amazingly and utterly stunning to look at. She had a true classic look, and she was a great actress.  She seemed to be in a class all her own.  Webb delivers some of the wittiest yet devilish lines in the film, and he is just pure brilliance in the role of Walter Lydecker. I don't know who beat him to Oscar that year, but he was extremely deservant of it himself.<br />This is a great classic old movie.  Worth watching!!!<br />I highly recommend this one!!!<p>Eileen Famiglietti</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />TRUE 5-STAR ENTERTAINMENT: #220 ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE'S BEST FILM LIST!<br /><br />"Laura" is the story of a beautiful young woman [Gene Tierney] whose story is told after her death.

Then, as if he were having a dream about all those letters and diaries he'd been snooping through, the front door opened and in walked a woman.

Is it a dream?<br /><br />OK --- SO WHO'S THE DEAD LADY THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS LAURA?<br /><br />Why was she killed?

This film's pace is uncharacteristically fast for this type of film, so hold on and pay close attention to the dialogue and details. Ok, NO more spoilers, you'll just have to see the film, and it is the best of its type that I have ever seen. What type? Film Noir, I am told. While I am not including any more plot spoilers, there is still plenty more plot and many surprises waiting for you when you see "Laura".</p></br><a href="../users/A1XN6MBYDBTX16.html">A1XN6MBYDBTX16</a><br/><p>I highly recommend this film.  I really enjoyed it.  It<br />was very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Now this is a real detective story. In fact, the detective is essentially the main character. Dana Andrews plays Lieutenant Mark McPherson, homicide detective. He's investigating the death of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). There are two primary suspects, her old friend Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) and her fiance Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price).<br /><br />So Waldo and Shelby tag along behind Lieutenant McPherson as he carries out his investigation. There's a lovely big portrait of Laura in her apartment, and it soon becomes clear to Waldo that Mark McPherson is falling in love with her. That would be tragic, except that she is not dead. She spent a long week-end in her cabin in the mountains, trying to decide whether she really wanted to marry Shelby or not. She creates quite a stir when she shows up alive while Mark is reading her letters and her journal.<br /><br />Things get complicated in a big hurry when it turns out the woman blasted with a shotgun was not Laura but a model by the name of Diane Redfern that worked in her advertising agency. She was in love with Shelby. And so was Ann Treadwell, Laura's wealthy aunt. In fact, Shelby was her boy toy.<br /><br />I'm trying not to give away too much of the story, since it is a detective story, after all. And the ending is so dramatic!

It's a classic movie detective story of the film noir genre with its haunting iconic theme music of the title song. Gene Tierney is the murder victim, and Dana Andrews is the detective, Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, who falls in love with the deceased. Webb plays Waldo Lydecker, a snide, nasty columnist and radio broadcaster who can make or break careers.<br />Price is a gigolo named Shelby, a Southern smoothie, who is beloved by Ann Treadwell played by the noted actress Judith Anderson who became famous for her portrayal of Euripides's Medea.<br />The movie in black and white holds up very well, and has a solid plot although some of the alibis get convoluted at times--especially Vincent Price's. It's Hitchcockian which is all to the good. It's based on a Vera Caspary novel.<br />It's rather strange that Dana Andrews does all his investigating without a partner, travels in cabs, and that he lets Webb tag along while interviewing suspects. To Andrews women are dames or dolls which makes him crude in Lydecker's eyes. Laura's successful career in advertising was the result of Lydecker's sponsorship.<br />Make sure you stay with it for the last twenty minutes because it becomes very suspenseful and is cleverly worked out. It's ell worth seeing or revisiting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though the murder mystery aspects of Laura don't work at all (I love when the cop finds a gun and then leaves it at the scene...just 'cause), the cast of characters (led by a wonderful Clifton Webb) are so interesting that Laura is worth recommending despite its flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>If you like films noirs, you'll probably like this.  It has all of the standard features--guys who wear big hats and their pants high, cops who call women "dolls" and "broads" and lots of cigarette smoking.  I like all that and love New York so I find this entertaining.  The plot is pretty good, the cast is excellent and then there's the enduring theme song.<br /><br />I found it better than many others of this genre but not as good as others.  I think it is an enjoyable period piece but it's not going to keep you awake at night thinking about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The picture nobody wanted, Laura was one of Fox's most notorious bad-luck pictures, and some of the bad luck stuck. After all the studio's A-list directors had turned it down (one of whom, John Brahm, ironically went on to remake it as Portrait For Murder in TV's 20th Century Fox Hour), Rouben Mamoulian began the picture until producer Preminger took over, reshooting much of his footage. Even David Raksin's famous theme only came about when Alfred Newman, Bernard Herrmann et al had turned down the picture. The result may well be an acknowledged classic, but while it's good, it's not THAT good.<br /><br />Something is missing. That we are unaware of working-class detective Andrews' infatuation with the dead murder victim Laura until until the venal Waldo Lydecker tells him, despite Andrews fine performance, is indicative of the problems of the film. That we have to be told so much instead of sensing it for ourselves is one of the film's greatest weaknesses. Some of this can be attributed to Darryl F. Zanuck's penchant for over-editing - it takes a while for it to become clear that the victim's face has been shot off - some to rewrites, but regardless of their cause, all play against the film. Structurally, too, it is scarred. The decision to reduce the original three narrators to one either goes too far or not far enough: as it stands, Waldo's opening narration is soon ignored and later lacks logic.<br /><br />Despite her awe-inspiringly bad taste in hats (she favors the S'Wester look), Gene Tierney is all about the look, not the performance here. While the painting of Laura (in reality a touched up photograph) holds a magical allure, she cannot live up to the eulogies of the supporting cast in the flesh. The real stars of the show are Vincent Price's Southern gigolo and Clifton Webb, great fun in an overwritten part as the patron saint of purple prose Waldo Lydecker that makes the film feel like a Joe Mankiewicz drawing room thriller rather than a noir.<br /><br />Yet for all its weaknesses, Laura is full of good things. There is some brilliant camerawork from Joseph LaShelle, who took over from Mamoulian's choice of Lucien Ballard after filming Webb's screen test (refusing to read for the role, Webb chose to do his Blithe Spirit monologue for the cameras instead!), while David Raksin's theme effectively haunts the detective in its various guises wherever he goes. When the two combine, as in a superb tracking shot that keeps Laura's portrait present in the frame with Andrews as he wanders through her apartment, they become the veritable blood in her veins, creating an impression that no actress could ever live up to. At times the picture even adds up to more than the sum of its parts and it's still a good wallow, but it's one best approached with few expectations if you want to get the most out of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***** 1944. Based on Vera Caspary's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558615059">Laura (Femmes Fatales: Women Write Pulp)</a>, LAURA was produced and directed by Otto Preminger. Academy award in the Best Cinematography category and four other nominations. While Det. Lt. Mark McPherson is investigating the murder of Laura Hunt, the young woman suddenly reappears in perfect health. LAURA is a motion picture I watch every five years or so. It's a gem of the film noir genre and it hasn't aged a bit. In my teenage years, I was mostly attracted by Gene Tierney's almost irreal presence on the screen, later it was Dana Andrews's taciturn and low-key performance that stroke me as essential and, yesterday, I finally understood that LAURA's main character was in fact Waldo Lydecker, played by the incredible Clifton Webb; this character literally forges Laura Hunt's personality and provokes, thanks to his suggestive descriptions of Laura Hunt, McPherson's love for the young woman. LAURA is a must if you like the film noir genre or, simply, Cinema. Indispensable.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>The theme from "Laura" is one of the most haunting ever written, by David Raksin, relatively unknown, but forever memorialized through this melody. Gene Tierney is at her peak of beauty, and she really is breathtaking in the most literal sense of the word. When I grew up this was always one of my favorite movies, and then when I re-discovered this movie as an adult, I was always mesmerized by her and by the entire cast, the score and the story, all prime examples of how great film noir can be when it's done with this amount of style and class.<p>SIDENOTE:<br />***I was not aware until recently of her tragic encounter with a female Marine at a Hollywood Canteen, during WW2. Apparently this Marine was hospitalized for German Measles, and she sneaked out of the hospital to meet her favorite movie star. She had her picture taken with GT, who was pregnant at the time, and also KISSED her, which resulted in her baby daughter being born with severe mental retardation. When Daria (the daughter) was four years old she was insititutionalized. GT met the woman one year later and found out how she had contracted German Measles, but did not mention the tragic consequences of the woman's actions for reasons unknown.***<p>What sets this particular movie apart from the rest of the genre, is it's cast and it's tasteful telling of the story, which includes the creme de la creme of New York society, played to the hilt by the cast. One of my chief joys in watching this movie, is the scene of Clifton Webb (as the acerbic critic, Waldo Lydecker) sitting in his enormous black bathtub(!) typing furiously, and relishing the power he has by virtue of his position as a critic. He takes savage pleasure in denigrating anyone who displeases him, either by their lack of talent or because of his own personal dislike.<br />There is not one moment of slack; all is interesting, relevant and suspenseful; you will NOT be able to figure it out until the end. On DVD, especially, this movie guarantees suspense and a fascinating glimpse into what the "Golden Age of Hollywood" was capable of...Excellent performances also by Vincent Price as the ne'er do well playboy, man about town, and Judith Anderson, a far cry from her portrayal of the redoubtable Mrs. Danvers in "Rebecca." If you have never seen this, get it; you will not be sorry, and if you have seen it, you should get it for the quality of the DVD...</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>A film noir classic comes to DVD for the first time packed full of more extras than expected, "Laura" tells the story of a society beauty (Gene Tierney in a career defining performance) murdered for no apparent reason. Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews in a hardboiled strong performance) investigates her murder questioning the men in her life beginning with a witty critic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb in a deliciously droll performance and in a major come back) and playboy Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). Seen in flashback, we discover Laura's background and how she rises from the middle class to world class society beauty with the assistance of those men in her life. Things take a surprising twist when McPherson meets the very woman who was murdered as the audience must figure out what's really going on.  A marvelous suspense thriller with elements of film noir, "Laura" continues to be haunting sixty years on.<br /><br /> A nicely detailed transfer with rich blacks and a nicely detailed picture, Fox has done a very good of job transferring this  classic to DVD. The DVD has some minor analog blemishes in the form of dirt and there's noticeable grain due to the stock of the film used to shoot the movie and how far removed the film is from the original nitrate negative (like most films from the era, the negative probably doesn't exist any longer although there's no information on the restoration here). The mono sound has nice presence with slight problems with hiss and other analog imperfections but, on the whole, it sounds superior to the previous releases on VHS and laserdisc.<br /><br />We get the A&E Biography programs on Price featuring interviews with Price biographer Lucy Price Williams, Price's daughter, friends and film co-workers. Price initially joined Orson Welles' Mercury Theater in New York. The droll comments by actor/writer Norman Lloyd about their experience together in the Mercury Theater alone makes this biography worth watching. Price had an easy going and natural style that still seems contemporary and when seeing his performance with other more affected performers of the time. His debut in a 1933 Constance Bennet comedy more demonstrated his flair and versatility. Over the course of seven years Price played everything from Brigham Young to the King of France. One of the cinema's most underrated performers, Price's performances particularly here continue to sparkle with wit and power.<br /><br />Gene Tierney's A&E Biography is a marvelous biography every bit the equal of the Price biography. Tierney began smoking to lower the pitch of her voice (at the advice of a studio executive) because she didn't like her voice thinking that she sounded like Minnie Mouse in her first film (she died of emphysema as a result of her life long addiction). Tierney's life had its tragic turns comparable to that of other beautiful stars of the day. She tumbled into depression after a failed marriage to costume designer Oleg Cassini and the birth of her mentally handicapped daughter resulting in her absence from the screen for nearly seven years. Tierney discovered that all the money she earned as an actress during the 40's was squandered by her father to support his failing business without her consent.<br /><br />We also get a deleted scene (a rarity for films from this time) consisting of a montage sequence detailing how Lydecker taught her about the finer things in life. It was feared that the "decadence" on display would offend troops fighting overseas. We also get a theatrical trailer which demonstrates how bad this fine film might have looked like without the fine restoration seen here. This alternate opening deleted after the first screening has been integrated back into the movie so you may watch either the original version or the edited version that's been seen by millions over the years.<br /><br />Historian Rudy Behlmer's commentary track tends to be the drier of the two tracks. He provides extensive background on the performers, the novel, director Otto Preminger. His comments on how Preminger had to fight for actor Clifton Webb to play Lydecker because of his well known homosexuality are particularly enlightening. Behlmer reads excerpts from Preminger's autobiography giving us insights from the director and writers of the project. Initially the writers wanted "Laura" to be a Broadway play before a film. Derailed; by politics and other issues, the script became a film instead despite lukewarm interest from MGM. MGM wanted to do the film as a "B" movie mystery while Fox had higher aspirations for the project. Preminger convinced the studio to buy the book. Initially working only as a producer on the project (his film failures had damaged his aspirations as a film director), Preminger took over direction from Rueben Mamoulian ("Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde") early on during the shooting of the film replacing the director after he butted heads with Preminger.<br /><br />Film composer David Raskin's commentary track is absolutely charming, involving and although his memories of the film have been colored by time, it's also a lot more inviting. Raskin's haunting, wistful romantic score acts as a perfect counterpoint to the action and, at other times, underlining the emotional core of the moment.<br /><br />A classic finally comes to DVD with plenty of bells and whistles. With an extremely good transfer, great commentary tracks featuring original film composer David Raskin and two excellent A&E Biography episodes on stars Gene Tierney and Vincent Price, "Laura" was worth the wait. The inclusion of a deleted scene and a version of the movie with and without the scene will delight long time fans of this terrific movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Released in 1944 to great popular and critical success, "Laura" was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, won for Best Cinematography, and solidified Gene Tierney's status as one of Hollywood's great stars of the 1940s. Based on the novel by Vera Caspary, "Laura" is a murder mystery revolving around the love of several men for its title character, the beautiful, enigmatic Laura. The film is often, though debatably, considered film noir due to its cynical characterizations and narrative structure, although it is not especially pessimistic and lacks the distinctive visual style of many classic film noirs.<br /><br />We are introduced to the mystery by Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a wealthy middle-aged columnist known for his acerbic wit. Laura was his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and, in his view, his creation to whom he was devoted and from whom he expected the same. Waldo has just learned of Laura's murder, and police Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) has come to interview him. Det. McPherson and Lydecker then visit Laura's Aunt, Mrs. Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson), who happens to be very close to Laura's dandyish fianc&eacute;, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). All of these people had motive to murder Laura, and all seem very capable of it. McPherson appears stoic and disinterested in anything but business, often to the consternation of his suspects. But as he reads Laura's private diary and correspondence and stares at the portrait in her apartment, McPherson becomes enchanted with her memory, perhaps in love with it. And then his investigation takes an unexpected twist.<br /><br />Much of the credit for elevating "Laura" from a clever murder mystery to a great and memorable film goes to the sharp, evocative dialogue. The three murder suspects  -Lydecker, Shelby, and Ann- are shamelessly selfish, but remarkably conscious of their own characters. Lydecker says, "I'm not kind; I'm vicious. It's the secret of my charm" and declares, "In my case, self-absorption is completely justified." Shelby describes himself: "I don't know a lot about anything, but I know a little about practically everything." "I can afford a blemish on my character, but not on my clothes." Lines like those could sound campy, but these great actors deliver them flawlessly. They entertain the audience with clever banter while providing complex motivations behind each man's relationship with Laura. Dana Andrews impresses as a man who seems incapable of loving a real person, but who is infatuated with a ghost. Like the others, he evokes a intriguing mixture of sympathy and revulsion. In an interesting role reversal, Laura has concentrated her energies on her career, while her suitors are preoccupied with their lifestyles. Between Gene Tierney's star power, Otto Preminger's direction, Samuel Hoffenstein's script, fabulous supporting performances, and David Raskin's score -which produced a hit song, "Laura" is as captivating today as it was in 1944.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): This is a quality print of the film, and the disc is loaded with features: 2 biographical documentaries, 2 audio commentaries, 1 deleted scene, a theatrical trailer, and the option to watch the film with a deleted sequence of Laura's transformation into a stylish society woman in tact. The 2 documentaries are "A&E Biographies". "Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait" (45 minutes) includes interviews with Tierney's ex-husband Oleg Cassini, sister Pat Byrne, and daughter Christina Cassini, among others. It follows Tierney's life from her birth in Brooklyn in 1920, to her success as one of the most popular actresses of the 1940s, through her marriage to designer Oleg Cassini and her struggles with mental illness in the 1950s, her retirement from acting and remarriage in the 1960s, until the end of her life in 1991 at the age of 70. "Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain" (45 minutes) discusses Price's nearly 60-year acting career, which included 100 films and nearly 2000 television appearances, and his avocation as a collector and promoter of fine arts. It traces his life from his birth in St. Louis in 1911, through his varied Hollywood career before turning to horror films, his final films and plays in the 1980s, to his death in 1993 at the age of 82. Includes interviews with Price's biographer Lucy Chase Williams, daughter Victoria Price, actress Jane Russell, among others.<br /><br />The two audio commentaries are both good. The first is by film professor Jeanine Basinger and composer David Raskin, who composed "Laura"'s score. These were apparently recorded separately, but on the same track. Basinger provides scene-by-scene analysis and commentary on the actors, characters, dialogue, directing decisions, and technique. Raskin comments on the score, but  unfortunately we rarely hear the music on the commentary track. The second commentary is by film historian and author Rudy Behlmer. He discusses the evolution of Vera Caspary's novel, would-be play, and this film in detail, based on information from drafts of the script, interviews he conducted with the principle creative persons, personal correspondence, and studio memos. He starts with Vera Caspari's idea for a story in 1939 and goes from there, eventually discussing the details of the film project. This commentary doesn't correspond to the scene we are looking at, but it is packed with interesting and probably hard-won information. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This film is an unqualified success.  Superb direction by Otto Preminger.  A story that takes twists and turns that not only have you on the edge of your seat that also makes sense.  Moody black-and-white cinematography that won the Oscar in 1944.  A haunting score by David Raksin.  This also has to be one of the most perfectly cast movies ever.  Dana Andrews is perfectly no-nonsense as Detective MacPherson.  Gene Tierney is not only alluringly beautiful as Laura but captivatingly mysterious.  Clifton Webb gives one of the all-time great supporting turns as the acerbic gossip columnist Waldo Lydecker.  Vincent Price is effectively sleazy as Shelby Carpenter, Laura's layabout fiancee.  Judith Anderson is excellent as a society matron who Carpenter sponges off of.  The film in general does not get it's due probably because it is told in a rather low-key manner and rather unflashy.  That said, it is essential viewing for anyone who fancies themself a film buff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>FIRST THOUGHTS: ----- Is it a dream??? ----- Gene Tierney as Laura, has a haunting look whose staying power is at the core of the film's meaning, and which is embodied by her surreal portrait that hangs on her wall.

The concept of a murdered woman who may not be dead after all certainly is compelling enough to serve as the basis for an intriguing film, but "Laura" just cannot make the most of its potential.<p>Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an up-and-comer in the advertising business. His two prime suspects are Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a mentor to the deceased woman, and Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a slimy opportunist who was wooing the victim. As McPherson gets deeper into his investigation, he starts to develop an obsession with the dead woman. He gazes at her portrait longingly and wonders to himself just what kind of woman she was. One night after searching her apartment, McPherson dozes off and is shocked by the identity of the person who eventually awakens him. <p>"Laura" is one of those frustrating films that should have been better than it was. The performances are all notable with Webb's being a particular standout. Tierney is beautiful as the victim of the story and it is easy to see why she would attract McPherson's attention even after her death. Yet, it becomes tiring to see McPherson bluffing his way out of situations over and over in an investigation where Lydecker actually does most of the investigating. Additionally, the sequence where McPherson finds the murder weapon is so clumsily shot that it drains all credibility from the film. In the end, the only certain thing that can be said about "Laura" is that among the better regarded film noir works from decades past, it is the one with the highest "camp" quotient and that isn't necessarily a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Laura, 1944 film<br /><br />It was a very hot day when Laura Hunt was murdered by a shotgun blast. Mr. Waldo Lydecker was questioned by another detective, Mark MacPherson. Lydecker writes a newspaper column on crime and murders. Laura's aunt is questioned about her payments to Mr. Shelby Carpenter. Lt. MacPherson goes to Laura's apartment, where her murder occurred. Laura came to New York to work in advertising, and tries to get a paid endorsement from Lydecker (how things work). Lydecker changed his mind, and became a promoter of Laura. She now moved in High Society circles. The story tells about the lives of Laura, Waldo, and Shelby. Laura helped Shelby, and Waldo is now jealous. The film shows the attitudes of the people in those days, according to Hollywood. Who bought a bottle of "Black Pony" scotch to Laura's place?<br /><br />The film is slow-paced and talky, like a stage play. There is a shocking surprise while Lt. MacPherson is in Laura's apartment. We learn more about Laura's past activities. The question now is who made a mistake in killing the woman? Shelby tells Lt. MacPherson about what happened Friday night. So all of Laura's friends are invited over for the grand finale, where the detective will interview all the people and solve the crime in a dramatic ending. There is another complication with Laura's behavior. But Lt. MacPherson figures out the likely suspect at the end.<br /><br />This film runs on until the ending that explains it all. I thought this story was implausible.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>I try to be [kind of] cultural and view the classics but I don't get it with this one. I know it may be because of the era, but this movie more resembles a play than a cinematic movie. I found nothing visually interesting or beholding here.<br /><br />The story is a murder mystery that takes a 90 degree turn in the middle of the movie...which takes the air out of the whole "mystery" aura. It's really not a mystery amyway since the perpetrator can be narrowed down to only 4 suspects.<br /><br />This movie consists of a murder victim, her trustfund-baby lover (Vincent Price in a very different role for what he would be later known for) , her obviously gay, svengali-like mentor, a devoted housekeeper and an extremely instrusive detective. Each charactor is horribly annoying and spewing out dialogue that is not only unbelievable but also completely intolerable to a normal person. I know in a "film noir", the viewer should accept the quirks for what they are but the dialogue and mannerisms are so utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />The most appealing aspect of the film is the actress who plays "Laura", Gene Tierney. Holy Smokes was she gorgeous and elegant looking. What is fascinating is that she is the voice of reason within the film but, I believe, she suffered from mental illness and led a tragic life after this film.<br /><br />I caught this on cable and TeeVoed it. I watched it because this is considered a must see, "classic" film. In that I watched it late night (my only opportunity), I was only able to watch it in 30 minute increments before I started to doze off. Consider that a warning/sneak preview.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>Laura can't compare as a film noir classic with Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, The Maltese Falcon and others. The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the mystery are too artificial and contrived. Not a single scene, from the start in the bathtub to the kiss in the doorway, is in any way believable: the same might be said of the others I've mentioned, but they succeed in drawing the viewer into their stories, and make him care about the outcome. This does not happen here: it is impossible to identify emotionally with anything that happens, and the murder puzzle is routine, in the style of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers and countless other detective mystery authors in the 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Laura does have a certain fascination. Although none of the actors convince as living in their parts, they still seem interesting as highly contrasted personalities, with widely differentiated careers and backgrounds. What struck me throughout was that I was being presented with a life-style and a set of values which seem totally to have vanished. A recognizably real world of constant cigarettes and cocktails, over-furnished apartments, social free-loaders and polished snubs --- perhaps this still exists somewhere, it's just that I left it behind 5 decades ago. 1944 was well before the days of method, minimalism, psychedelia, kitchen-sink and trailer-trash. Class ruled, and manners held a meaning they no longer do. This brittle house of cards was bound for collapse.<br /><br />The best thing about this disc is the section featuring the sympathetic biographies of Gene Tierney and Vincent Price. Both seemed to be, in very different yet oddly similar ways, rather fine and good people. One fortunate, the other unfortunate. These insights make the whole package well worth seeing, but the film on its own is, regretfully, not worth more than three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>All film buffs should see Otto Preminger's "Laura" at least once. This complex, moody drama features the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney in the title role. The epitome of noir, many of the movie's scenes actually do take place on the proverbial dark and rainy night. "Laura" is much more than a murder mystery, however. It is also a psychological study of a controlled, analytical man who becomes obsessed with a dead woman. The superb acting, especially Clifton Webb's brilliant performance, fascinating characters, witty dialogue, Joseph LaShelle's Oscar-winning high contrast black and white cinematography, creative direction and taut storyline, make this an all time classic.<br /><br />Wealthy, beautiful New York socialite Laura Hunt is brutally murdered, killed in her own apartment by a shotgun blast aimed directly at her head. Hard boiled, street savvy Police Lieutenant Mark McPherson, (Dana Andrews), investigates the crime. (cool trench coat, too!). The more he learns about the deceased woman, and the longer he stares at her portrait, the more obsessed with her he becomes. Laura's story is told through flashbacks.<br /><br />The lovely lady had two main men in her life, whose effete, mean-spirited characters have always made me wonder about her lack of good taste. Waldo Lydecker (played masterfully by Clifton Webb), is a shallow, conceited, hypocritical intellectual snob, whose acid wit is a film highlight. He had a dinner date with Laura on the night she died, but she canceled. Lydecker, the young woman's mentor, had helped further her career tremendously and acted as her advisor on many occasions. He believes he was indispensable to Laura, who, unfortunately for him, fell in love with Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). Carpenter is a real philanderer, who is adverse to work of any kind, and readily admits it. The young woman's aunt, Ann Treadwell, (Judith Anderson), is yet another nasty neurotic, in love with Carpenter, and riddled with jealousy of her niece. The three are all suspects, but as McPherson says, in the line parodied by Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau, "I suspect everybody and nobody." When the no nonsense detective first spoke these words, however, there was no cause for laughter.<br /><br />I don't want to go into too much detail and spoil this great film for those who have yet to see it. Let it suffice to say that there are many surprising plot twists and turns, passion, blackmail, lots of suspense and superior performances here. And of course, the haunting song "Laura," a memorable piece by David Raksin is the theme.<br /><br />DVD extras include excellent biographies of Tierney and Price, two audio commentaries featuring film scholars, and a deleted scene. My highest recommendations!<br /><br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>&quot;Laura&quot; is one of those movies you hear about all your life, it seems, and then when you see it, you know why. It's slick, funny, classy, and luxurient. I recently introduced my sister-in-law to it, and got to experience all the pleasure of my first viewing over again seeing her enjoyment. This movie made a star of Gene Tierney, and why not? She looks beautiful in every shot, and of course especially in that bewitching portrait that commands the living room of Laura's sumptuous apartment, the site of the inexplicable shotgun murder of Laura, the most sought after woman of her set.  The mood of the film is created by the wonderful narration of Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), who recounts how he encountered an ambitious young woman whom he nurtured into a success, socially and professionally. The combination of his words and the accompanying glamour shots of Laura fix for the viewer the indelible image of a woman who transcends class. In contrast to Waldo's word paintings are the world-weary remarks of Mark MacPherson, the detective assigned to investigate Laura's murder, played by Dana Andrews. Though he appears to scoff at the imago of Laura created by Waldo, Mark is secretly seduced by it, aided by reading her private letters and handling her beautiful things in the apartment, and of course studying her portrait. Rounding out the cast are Judith Anderson as Laura's aunt Ann and Vincent Price as Shelby, Laura's on again off again fiance. The affair of these two suggest that things were not perfect in Laura's seemingly fairy tale life. And of course, like all good film noir murder mysteries, &quot;Laura&quot; has a riveting plot twist that makes you throw all your previous ideas out the window. One of the true film classics--you can't go wrong with this one. ....</p></br><a href="../users/AK61LQI92GTCH.html">AK61LQI92GTCH</a><br/><p>Wonderful story of a hard-boiled detective who falls in love with a painting, a dead woman who comes back to life and is immediately placed under suspicion of murder, and a haughty newspaper columnist slinging sarcastic from the sidelines.<br /><br /> Otto Preminger's 1944 crime-thriller LAURA holds up remarkably well.  Gene Tierney is luminous as the title character (and she CAN act), Dana Andrews convincingly falls for a dead woman, and Clifton Webb threatens to steal the show as the brittle and acerbic newspaperman Waldo Lydecker.  Rounding out the major players are Vincent Price and Judith Anderson.  Oh, and the music includes the haunting `Laura,' by David Raksin, one of the most famous themes in film history.<br /><br /> LAURA stands up well under repeated viewings.  In the course of a month or so I watched it three times.  First al dente, second with the Rudy Behlmer commentary, third with the David Raksin and Jeanine Basinger commentary.  I haven't watched LAURA for years, and my memory, helpfully enough, failed to retain any of the major plot points, so the big surprises were surprises again, although I have to admit the `falling in love with the painting' stuff was lost on me until pointed out in the commentaries.  The Behlmer track was filled with the historical back story behind the making of this picture, valuable and welcome, although not always pertinent to what was happening on screen at the time.  David Raskin wrote the score for LAURA, Jeanine Basinger is a film professor at Wesleyen University.  Raskin died recently, in 2004, at the age of 92.  Raskin's contributions on the track are pretty slight, perhaps he was in declining health when it was recorded, and it seems likely Basinger is on the same track to fill in the long silences.  They don't sound like they're conversing, and Basinger doesn't add a lot of information that we don't already get from Behlmer's track.<br /><br /> Anyway, it's another feature on a feature packed dvd.  Two episodes of A&E's Biography series are included.  The first is titled `Gene Tierney - A Shattered Portrait.'  If you don't know much about Tierney's life, and I didn't, this is a bit of an eye-opener.  The strong impression is of a graced life beset by tragedy and tragedy-induced mental instability.  Among the talking heads in this 1999 production are Richard Widmark and first husband Oleg Cassini.  A much happier life is the subject of the second feature, the 2000 `Vincent Price - The Versatile Villain.'  Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper and others fondly remember the actor who bore the `irresistible air of wickedness.'  On its own LAURA is first-rate.  The extras don't add anything to its luster, but they make for a bountiful feast.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>This movie was based on one of the most romantic premises you could imagine.

As with some other recent restorations, it seems that someone literally went frame by frame and made this luxurious, velvety result that you and I can enjoy.<br /><br />It's wonderful, and the commentaries are very, very interesting as well.  That something of this quality helped our servicemen get through World War II is also incredibly romantic and very, very moving.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Years ago we used to go to an old theater that was an art and nostalgia theater.  The owner was a professor and he gave lectures about the movies preceding them which were wonderful.  We spent at least ten years there catching up on cinema.  One of our earliest film fanatic discoveries was LAURA. He told us our film ouvre was sadly deficient lacking this film.<br /><br />Otto Preminger was a first rate film director.  There isn't a wasted second on his picture.  There is the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney who plays Laura.  She was also a very good actress. Not too far into the movie, Laura is murdered .  The detective assigned to the case is the handsome, magnetic Dana Andrews. He begins by sifting through Laura's apartment.  There is a big portrait of her looking down at him almost everywhere he turns. He starts mourning the loss of such a woman as he tries to find clues to the suspect. Then the movie takes a 180 degree twist.<br /><br />I've watched it several times since, even knowing the twist and the resolution, and surprisingly,  it holds up each time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>There are greater film noirs than "Laura"--"Double Indemnity" and "Out of the Past" immediately come to mind--but its sheer, silky elegance and insinuating malevolence, backed by David Raksin's hauntng theme music, cast a spell over viewers that is rare in any film genre. Otto Preminger never again matched his achievement here, as he tells Vera Caspary's tale of wealthy, decadent New Yorkers suspected of murdering a beautiful young socialite. There are so many glorious things about this movie that it's hard to enumerate them all in a capsule review, but surely one must start with the actors. Gene Tierney, her heartbreaking beauty matched by her air of innocent, straightforward gentility, achieved screen immortality with this one role, and deserved to. Dana Andrews, as the tough, wily police detective who falls for her, finds just the right blend of cynicism and moral clarity, all the better to outfox the hothouse egoism of the suspects. As Tierney's aunt and fiance, Judith Anderson and Vincent Price are a match made in Hell--charming, weak, and utterly treacherous. But the standout is Clifton Webb, lean and sharp as a rapier, making his film debut at 55 after a lifetime on the Broadway stage. As the acidulous radio personality Waldo Lydecker (think Alexander Woollcott meets Captain Hook), Webb pours venom into every scene he's in and makes us lap it up. (A sample line: "I should be sincerely sorry if my neighbors' children were devoured by wolves.") The wolves in "Laura" are not in sheep's clothing, but in evening dress, and to watch Andrews outsmart them is cinematic pleasure of a very high order indeed. The print on the current DVD release is quite good, and the extras include two interesting "A&E Biography" episodes: one about the sad life of Gene Tierney, blighted by mental illness and family tragedy, and one about the considerably happier, healthier life of Vincent Price, a bon vivant in the best sense of the term.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>The movie has magic woven in it. The way it was filmed looked sumptuous even in black and white. I am not sure why the film got to me so much except that it seemed so mysterious that the main charzcter had been dead for almost half the movie and that comes back to life. It just struck a chord in me and when the handsome Dana Andrews seems to be having a date with the dead woman also intrigued me, a different storyline than other films. I think the best thing was the acting, of course everybody loved Clifton Webb and Vincent Price. And I to liked the way Price acted in the film with his ever so slight Kentucky accent and smooth manners! It was more Gene Tierney who caught my imagination. Why, I am not sure except I liked the slow way she moved and talked. I am not even sure it that is what I want to say, she just had a charisma about her. The way she acted like a little child that needed protecting and than like a nurturing mother, it really made alot of the movie for me. I can't really place it bit I definately felt like she fit the part for Laura. I never saw her in any other movies but I think I will check out some more that she acted in. A note of interest, she suffered from emotional problems in her thirties and underwent shock therapy for depression. How sad! This is a must see for anyone interested in film noir. <p>Lisa Nary</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>It's a classic tale of love, murder and obsession, when a homicide detective becomes enamored of the victim of a brutal murder he's investigating, in "Laura," directed by Otto Preminger and starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  The story begins with the discovery of the murder of Laura Hunt (Tierney), a young advertising executive in New York City, and as detective Mark McPherson (Andrews) makes his investigation and begins to fit together the pieces of the puzzle of Laura's life and death, the essence of who she was begins to emerge.  And it gives the story an interesting twist; for after seeing a portrait of Laura, and getting to know her by reading her most intimate personal letters and diary (routine for a murder investigation), McPherson becomes obsessed with her, and soon discovers he's not alone; there was another man obsessed with her as well.  Subsequently, he must determine if that obsession played any part in Laura's death.  The suspects include the men in her life, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a radio personality/columnist who helped her begin her career, and Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), her fiance, a man of seemingly dubious character who had recently been involved with a model who worked for Laura's agency.  The list doesn't end with them, however; also in the running is a man named Jacoby (John Dexter), the artist who painted the portrait of Laura that so mesmerized McPherson, and then there's some question as to the relationship between a certain Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) and Carpenter that is yet to be resolved.  <p> Preminger delivers a solid mystery that will keep you in suspense until the very end, but with only enough tension to keep it interesting rather than engrossing.  And though the story is believable, there are elements of the plot that develop so quickly it stretches credibility a bit.  An additional two or three scenes relating to certain aspects of the characters lives (especially Laura's) would have had a significant impact of this film-- good as it is-- and with a running time of 85 minutes (on most prints) it wouldn't have been out of the question to expand it somewhat.<p> As far as the characters, McPherson, Lydecker and Carpenter emerge fully sketched and need little development; you know exactly who they are and where they've been.  This is not the case with Laura, however; Tierney's character suffers somewhat from lack of development, and as the story unfolds, she seems to get from here to there with little discernible change.  What the character needed was a bit more depth and some real definition.<p> Which is exactly what Andrews and Webb give to their characters; Webb as the flamboyant and self-assured Lydecker, Andrews as the stoic and deliberating McPherson.  Price gives a notable performance, as well, but has a tendency to lapse into melodrama occasionally, which can be distracting at times.  And Tierney gives a passable performance, though her acting is not on a par with her exquisite beauty.  In her initial encounter with Lydecker, for instance, her pronounced coyness is somewhat diverting.  Still, her presence on the screen is radiant, which makes it easy to overlook the slight flaws in her acting.  <p> The supporting cast includes Dorothy Adams (Bessie), Cy Kendall (Inspector), Grant Mitchell (Lancaster Corey), Buster Miles (Office Boy) and Frank La Rue (Hairdresser).  A good mystery, but with few surprises, "Laura" nevertheless remains a classic in it's own right.  It's not a perfect film (the final words spoken, in fact, are decidedly melodramatic), but it's good storytelling, and is ultimately satisfying.  Saying that there was room for improvement would be nit-picking; suffice to say that it is what it is, which is a pretty good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>I originally came to this film without any knowledge of it beyond having read that it was an exceptional film--and given that LAURA is at heart a noir mystery, that was perhaps for the best.  So, if you prefer to skip the commentary and approach the film untainted, I give my recommendation now: buy it immediately.<p>Based on the popular novel by Vera Caspery, LAURA begins as a mystery pure and simple: Laura Hunt, a beautiful and successful young woman, has been found dead in her elegant New York apartment, murdered by a shotgun blast to the head.  Tough and rough Detective Mark McPherson is assigned to investigate--and slowly, as he delves into her world of high society, gossip columns, business success, and personal glamour he becomes romantically obsessed with the victim.  Much of the story is told via flashback as McPherson interviews Laura's friends and acquaintances: the waspish Waldo Lyedecker, an acid-tongued columnist who "discovered" Laura; her aunt Ann Treadwell, who envied Laura; her fiance Shelby Carpenter, who depended upon Laura.  The device is extremely effective, and lures the viewer into the same fascination with Laura that Detective McPherson experiences.<p>The cast is extraordinary.  Although generally admired more for beauty than acting ability, Gene Tierney delivers a first-rate performance as as Laura, seen early in the film in flashback; she is a remarkably attractive woman, and she plays with a perfect mix of coolness and innocence.  While I have never much admired Dana Andrews, he is perfectly cast as the street-common detective who is gradually consumed by obsession with Laura.  But the real standouts here are Clifton Webb as the posionously witty Waldo Lydecker, the powerful Judith Anderson (best remembered as Mrs. Danvers in REBECCA) as Laura's aunt, and Vincent Price as Laura's weakling fiance.  The script is a pearl beyond price, running at a rapid pace and shot through with some of the most memorable dialogue (most going to Clifton Webb) in Hollywood history.  Everything about the film strikes precisely the right chord: the cinematography that shifts between hard and soft, the subtle camera movements, the mysterious and memorable theme song, and the cast itself.  A truly fascinating film that can be enjoyed again and again; dead or alive, LAURA remains as captivating today as she was a half-century ago.  Strongly, strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>I am so glad my father made me watch this movie. "Laura" is a fantastic movie.

He interviews the two men who knew her best: smarmy critic Waldo Lydecker (a perfectly creepy Clifton Webb) and her mysterious fiance Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price).

He's the detective investigatng the murder of a young woman believed to be Laura Hunt, shot in the face with both barrels of a shotgun. That's an important fact to remember even though the body is never shown. We have the start of the much acclaimed, & rightly so, noir murder mystery, Laura. We have a rogues' gallery of prominent suspects. They are a rather disagreeable lot. Casting could not have been better. Clifton Webb is the insufferable radio columnist, Waldo Lydecker. He is the narraror of much of the movie & the cultural mentor to the younger Laura, (Couldn't you just slap him?). He is love with Laura almost as much as he's in love with himself. He is violently against her marriage to: Shelby Carpentor, played<br />by Vincent Price the once wealthly but now broke fiance' of Laura. He's a playboy, cheats on Laura & has never worked a day in his life. Then there is Judith Anderson as the rich widow, Ann Treadwell. She is desperately in love with Shelby & will do anything to have him. Finally, a mysterious young model that works for Laura & is Shelby's lover. That leaves poor Lt. McPherson to fall in love with the hauntingly, beautiful portrait of Laura, (Gene Tierney) above the mantle. Lt. McPherson likes to drink. So he does, at Laura's home using Laura's booze while on the job questioning the suspects. He dines with the suspects & they pick up the tab. Things have changed in the police dept. This novel transfered very well to the screen in the hands of director Otto Preminger. It is early in his career but it is some of his best work. You may figure out who did it before the climax. I won't tell here but the process & the acting excellence is what's important. On your dvd there may be a scene deleted from the theatrical release. It is the story of Laura's rise to prominence with the help of Waldo. This movie was played to many servicemen overseas & it was felt that scene might have been offensive. You decide, I didn't think so. There were some questions raised that in this war time movie there was not a hint of a war going on. Maybe why an able bodied guy like Lt.

After rounds of questioning, etc., the finger points to Waldo.<br /><br />The story is excellent and very tight, but that's not what makes this film noir so special. Great dialogue, wonderful atmosphere, and the constant use of the haunting theme music do. Only one punch is thrown in the whole picture, a mild one at that, which is almost unique to the genre. Tierney is beautiful with her pouty mouth, and nobody except maybe Bogart wore a fedora as well as Andrews.

Yes I know most of the characters are manipulative in nature. But second time viewing, low and behold; who manipulates Waldo from the very beginning and uses his connections to clime the corporate latter? Then pretty much snubs him.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Vincent price play a character (Shelby Carpenter) that is not in a spook movie.<br /><br />Look how confident Dana Andrews as Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, is in this movie.

The first was because I'm a huge fan of "Twin Peaks", and I've heard that the film inspired it.  (After watching it, I can see that it did, in some ways)  The second was because the premise sounded very interesting to me.<br /><br />Dana Andrews is terrific as Detective Mark McPherson, the calm policeman who is investigating the death of Laura Hunt (the wonderful Gene Tierney).  Laura was loved by everybody.  But in McPherson's book, everybody is a suspect - including Laura's fiance, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price!); Laura's aunt (Judith Anderson), who may be involved with Shelby; and the cynical, bitter Waldo Lydecker (a great performance by Clifton Webb), who introduced Laura to the world.<br /><br />Otto Preminger decided not to use any special camera angles or cinematic tricks like that, and it helps make the film seem all the more realistic.  The performances are top-notch and the script is well-written (the second draft was written by an uncredited Ring Lardner, Jr.), the latter of which features some fine twists.  There's also a now-classic score, which includes a magnificent theme song, by David Raksin.<br /><br />If you're looking for an intriguing, well-made film noir, this may be the one for you.  "Laura" is a masterpiece of the film noir genre, and it may very likely be one of the best movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Laura is one of the quintessential examples of classic Hollywood film noir. All the attributes are there - a mysterious murder, brooding romanticism, the obsession of a beautiful woman, and a love that reaches far beyond the dark shadow of death. Elegantly directed by Otto Preminger, Laura is all about the lengths one will go, to prove one's love. The story is about passion and infatuation and about two very different men who end up being obsessed with the same woman.<br /><br />The movie begins as the wealthy Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) sits in his bathtub writing Laura's biography in his swank Manhattan penthouse. It soon becomes obvious that he has been sexually obsessed with a woman who was just found murdered. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), a working class detective assigned to the case, is questioning Waldo about his relationship with Laura.<br /><br />Mark is ruggedly handsome, muscular, and down-to-earth, the complete opposite to the snotty, effete Waldo. From the outset, the two take an instant dislike to one another.  Although Waldo did not have a sexual relationship with Laura, they were great friends, he admired her beauty and gave her first big break in the advertising world where she moved into a position of prominence through her own ability.<br /><br />Mark becomes captivated with the dead woman when he searches her apartment and sees a beautiful portrait of her, but he is frustrated that he doesn't have any leads to the case. Waldo tells Mark that he has been constantly obsessed with her and jealous of her other boyfriends in the 5-years that he knew her. He was particularly resentful of Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), whom he despises as being someone who is a weakling, a scoundrel and a scam artist.<br /><br />Laura's older aunt, Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson), is in love with Shelby and doesn't care if his character is rotten, even supporting the bankrupt society person from Kentucky with funds. Mark is convinced that Anne, Shelby, and Waldo, are hiding something and they all become his suspects in the murder. As the young detective keeps digging into Laura's life, a sudden revelation casts light on whether it was really Laura that was murdered after all.<br /><br />Love letters, an antique clock, and an alibi that just doesn't add up, all factor into the serpentine plot. As Mark becomes more obsessed with Laura's portrait, he seems to be more intent on finding her killer, with Waldo and Shelby becoming the two most likely suspects. The film's theme of obsession ends on a psychopathic note, showing which one is not willing to give up his ideal woman to the other.<br /><br />The acting is magnificent, with the beautiful Gene Tierney perfectly suited to the icy and cool Laura. Dana Andrews is a revelation as Mark, and his truculent, sexy he-man attitude is nicely juxtaposed to the caustic almost effeminate performance of Webb. But it seems odd to me that Shelby and Waldo; the films two prissiest men are even attracted to Laura in the first place.<br /><br />Adding to Preminger's accomplished direction is the arresting cinematography by Joseph La Shelle, which creates a moody, tension fuelled atmosphere. Laura is a provocatively twisted tale; a very satisfying seductive thriller that explores the nature of unrequited love and the notion that misplaced romantic infatuation will always end in disaster.

A gorgeous young woman is killed and the detective assigned to the case (Dana Andrews) becomes obsessed with her portrait. Suspects include her fiance (Vincent Price), his sugar-mama (Judith Anderson), and a sarcastic radio star (Clifton Webb) who loved her.  The actors are all elegant, graceful, and beautiful, especially Gene Tierney as Laura. The theme music is, of course, very important to the movie. It's all handled with great style. You'll love it!</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Waldo Lydecker, who can forget that name or that character, portrayed by Clifton Webb. If you have not seen the film I do not want to give the plot away. This is an intelligent mystery distinguished by witty dialogue, stylistic photography and production design and excellent acting. Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews and Vincent Price are perfectly cast. Preminger being more of the technician and perfectionist assembled all these talents to produce this genuine classic. David Raksin's theme is one of Hollywood's standards. Joseph LaShelle won an Oscar for his Black &amp; White Cinematography.</p></br></body></html>

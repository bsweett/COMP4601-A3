To mess it further, all of the pretty suave turns in the movie were thrown to the dogs in an absolutely feel-good denouement... <p>Other than that, this is a very watchable movie. The execution is brilliant, film students take note of the camerawork and the screenplay. Above all, Nick Cage is really the cornerstone of the movie's class, his potrayal of someone with a cleanliness (and darkness) OCD is the stuff that Oscars are handed out for. <p>Some of the negative reviews talk of the morally challenged script. Well, I never for a moment felt that Cage's or Rockwell's characters were oblivious of their follies. That they were depicted in a likeable manner does not mean that the script advocates or endorses their behavior. <p>This is no "Get Shorty" in style or story, but is quite a decent rental nonetheless. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>when i first saw this movie i didn't understand it. now i understand it and i have to say it's fantastic. nicholas cage pulls this movie off. sam rockwell is just in for the ride but like in confessions of a dangerous mind he had a very good performance.it's a colorful quirkly and darkly humnorous film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage has been one of my favorite actors for a long time now.  He has had some stinkers recently (8MM, Bringing out the Dead) but he returns with a performance so masterful, it almost makes the earlier bombs not seem as bad.  He is forced into multiple roles in this movie and he pulls them off masterfully.<p>Cage plays Roy Waller, a con man (or Matchstick man) who works with partner Sam Rockwell to bilk people out of money to install water filter systems.  Once they have that cash, they go to the house of the suckers posing as Federal agents and gain access to their accounts to get all they own.  It's brilliant and the two work it perfectly.<p>There are a couple of hitches.  One is that Roy has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)  He has to open and close doors three times (while counting aloud) before going through them, he abhors shoes or any dirt on his carpet at home, and when he loses his medication down the drain, he goes through his entire house cleaning every square inch.  Cage plays the part perfectly; he is totally believable as a man with this condition and that speaks highly of his performance.<p>The other hitch is 14 year old Allison Lohman playing Cage's daughter from a previous marriage.  She shows up in a park to meet him and soon they are the best of friends.  She finds out eventually what he does for a living (he told her at first that he is an antique dealer) and even learns a few tricks of the trade from him.  She is a real breath of fresh air in the film and she will be making movies for years to come.<p>This film has been compared to "The Sting" many times, presumably for the ending, which does contain some surprises.  It is similar to the 1974 classic.  This time the Robert Shaw role is played by Bruce McGill.  But as you will see, this film even takes the con further, to areas that were a complete surprise to me.  It is effective, smart, funny at times, and with the performance Nicolas Cage turns in, it's a complete winner.  Cage should get some votes for best actor here.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Matchstick Men" is film noir with a heart of gold, and it is worse off for its generosity. Ostensibly the tale of an obsessive/compulsive con man (Nicolas Cage) and a newly formed, world-shattering (for him) relationship with his 13-year-old daughter (Alison Lohman), Ridley Scott's film works toward something bigger, which, when revealed, is a fairly sharp right turn. <p>Imagine, then, an epilogue that turns just as sharply back to the left - duping the dupe, if you will - and you've approximated how "Matchstick Men" unfurls in its final 20 minutes. A cheat of a cheat is even dirtier than the real thing.<p>Back in a role that best fits his showboat antics, Cage is Roy, a barely functioning LA huckster who scams retirees with a showboat his equal, Frank (Sam Rockwell), who pines to play a large-sum con that Roy, millions in bank, doesn't need. Just how Roy has survived years of panic attacks brought on by loose carpet fibers and hamburger crumbs is left unsaid, but for the time being he pops illegal anti-depressants, until, during a fit, he loses them down the sink drain.<p>See a shrink, Frank helpfully suggests, going so far to "give him a name" of an amiable, soft-bellied practitioner (Bruce Altman) who gently nudges Roy to connect with Angela, a daughter he's never known, played by Lohman with a intelligence beyond, shall we say, her 13 years. Angela is like a serum for Roy's ailments - she so completely obliterates his home upon her first visit he can't help but submit to a cure. <p>It tricks him into accepting two things:  Frank's score and a vortex of trust toxic to a game grifter. <p>A literate, a-bing-bang-boom script from Ted and Nicolas Griffin, based on Eric Garcia's recent novel, is slightly short on originality -every con there is has been played on the big screen, after all - but long on speed and tight dialogue; it doesn't feature a wide cast, but draws clearly the principals.<p>Cage has generally been at his best when uninhibited, and Roy provides him the chance to play the gamecock dandy for all its worth: He struts and stutters and smokes and sweats so effectively, the audience is engaged in a kind of transference. Scott presents early panic scenes with such clarity and urgency that Angela's entrance in Roy's life works on us as much as it does Roy. <p>And Lohman, at 23, is terrific at the cute, smart kid, as good here as she was in "White Oleander;" that the father/daughter dynamic works at all is thanks to her performance, partially by design, when you think about it.  Rockwell is the goofy cowboy sidekick laying his own odds. And I like Altman as the shrink, in a more important role in the film than it seems.<p>The twist of "Matchstick Men" is there to see, but not in plain view; Scott plays to our growing distrust of the grift (and Angela) with a series of red flags that nevertheless don't diminish the stomach-panging moment the switch is flipped. Upon that scene's arrival, the movie has reached a suitable, logistic close, but an epilogue, following the title card "One Year Later," presents a pretty fishy (Who are we kidding? It's unbelievable) resolution to Roy's "journey of discovery." Quentin Tarantino has his own issues with his "Kill Bill," but I suspect he would have known how to put a final, crushing spin on the story without sacrificing the essential nature of a well-acted character.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>A rather surprising turn for Ridley Scott there - probably the "smallest" film he's ever done, which harks back to Thelma And Louise than to anything else he's done in recent years (Gladiator, G.I Jane, Black Hawk Down, and back to Alien and Blade Runner). We have a very personal, up-close light drama here. Con artist movies have been swarming the theatres lately, but Matchstick Men is far more intelligent and more surprising, not to mention well-acted, written and directed, than Supercast films Heist and The Score. Nicolas Cage, after several years of B-action movies (Gone In 60 Seconds, 8 mm, The Rock, Face/Off...) makes a welcome return to what he does best - disturbed, neurotic, sensitive individuals (a comeback that got off to a good start on the schizophrenic Adaptation) - and delivers an Oscar nomination-worthy performance as con artist Roy Waller. Roy discovers a long-lost daughter, played brilliantly by Alison Lohman - also Oscar material. The relationship between the two is well crafted, and the story wonderfully written. Sam Rockwell also makes a fine contribution as Roy's partner.<p>Elements of the plot may owe much to many other films - The Sting, perhaps Jacky Brown, and there's a bit of Leon (AKA The Professional) in Roy's relationship with his daughter, trying to balance a life of crime with a newfound family, and Lohman's performance is no less charming than that of Natalie Portman on that memorable classic. Worthy of praise is Ridley's directing, which proves he can make a small human theatre piece as well as grandiose historical epics and sci-fi odysseys. The editing is wonderful, well visualizing Roy's condition and giving the movie an apt atmosphere. Overall, Matchstick Men is one of the freshest films of the year, and a very enjoyable watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The versatile and adept Nicolas Cage is outstanding as obsessive compulsive con man Roy Waller in Matchstick Men.  Cage, chock full of tics and spasms, and his grifting partner Frank, nicely played by Sam Rockwell (Green Mile and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) are small time California operators looking for a big score.  When Cage accidently dumps the medication that keeps him on an even keel down the drain, he freaks out.  Cage takes his partner's advice and sees a shrink.<p>Cage, a divorcee, starts to settle down when he shockingly discovers that he has fathered a now 14 year old daughter.  He opts to meet the girl, well acted by Alison Lohman, who proceeds to make Cage's life a tumultuous mess.  Cage and Lohman actually start developing a close relationship with Cage teaching the girl the tricks of his trade.<p>Ridley Scott, not known for lighter subject matter like this movie does a commendable job directing the film.  The movie proceeds a tad slowly at points but concludes with a blindsiding yet satisfying twist.</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>Matchstick Men, is an immensly entertaining caper comedy from director Ridley Scott.  Nicholas Cage plays Roy, a con man who has obsessive-compulsive disorder works with a parter played by Sam Rockwell, also good here.  Cage and Rockwell are the best here, the pros at what they do.  Making cons successful each time, though when Cage loses his pills to an unforunate accident he must see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist advises him to see the past in his life and find out more about his earlier life.  Surprisingly enough a 14 year-old daugher is involved named Angela played by Alison Lohman.<br />  Angela soons learns of her father's profession and wants to learn how to actually perform a con.  From here the film takes on an even more interesting path.  Even though the film as a clever premise, Cage's amazing perfomance dazzles and really keeps you fully focused.  Based on the novel by Eric Garcia, "matchstick" is a slang term for con artists.  Diretor Ridley Scott continues to impress with another wonderful film here aside from his other good work including Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Alien, even Hannibal.<br />  Matchstick Men is rated PG-13 for Thematic Elements, Violence, Some Sexual Content and Language.  The violence includes a brief shooting, the profanity is rather occasional.  The film does have a pleasing, moral ending and the story of a father-daughter relationship really can be gripping.  Worth viewing in theares and possibly owning on video and DVD, a much more better film that you'd expect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Matchstick Men was probably the best movie that I had seen all year. I didn't find one part of it boring at all and found myself on the edge of my seat for a while. The ending had such a twist, I was confused for a while, then everything made sense. I rented this movie as soon as it came out and then bought it, its definitely worth watching again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Roy (Nicholas Cage) is an obsessive-compulsive con man who functions remarkably well when he's bilking victims out of their hard-earned cash, but is a complete wreck in his personal life. Frank (Sam Rockwell) is Roy's partner and prot&eacute;g&eacute; in a complicated phone scam business. Desperate for medication, Roy visits a psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) who encourages him to seek out the child he never knew from his previous marriage. But Roy finds that he's gotten more than he bargained for when his long lost 14-year-old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman) disrupts his ordered life just as Roy is in the middle of a delicate and very lucrative con.<p>"Matchstick Men" was adapted for the screen by Nicholas and Ted Griffin from the novel of the same name by Eric Garcia. Ridley Scott, in a departure from his usual action fare, directs this idiosyncratic "dramedy". The cast is all superb. Nobody does nervous ticks like Nicholas Cage, even though I'm tired of seeing him do them. Part of the trouble with this film comes from some confusion in its tone: It might have been a brooding character study, but director Scott wanted it to be a black comedy. Good call, but the film isn't funny enough to captivate the audience on that level. It doesn't impress as a character study because all of the characters are annoying. That's played for laughs, but doesn't consistently succeed because the film is just so self-absorbed. Black comedy or character study aside -which is where you will find them- "Matchstick Men" is a Grift Movie. And the grift works. It's a good one, and this is where "Matchstick Men" is successful. This is a good-looking film; I like the cinematography and production design. The performances are impressive. But it's a little rough to sit through (The second half is better than the first, so don't give up too soon). It just doesn't come across as it should. I recommend "Matchstick Men" to fans of grift movies and fans of Nic Cage, but I don't think its successes are going to outweigh the tedium for anyone else.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary entitled "Tricks of the Trade", an audio commentary by director Ridley Scott, screenwriter Nicholas Griffin, and  screenwriter/producer Ted Griffin, and  a theatrical trailer. "Tricks of the Trade" has three parts: pre-production, production, and post-production, and includes interviews with Ridley  Scott, the film's casting director, writers, producers, author Eric Garcia, and Hans Zimmer, who composed the film's score. It follows the making of "Matchstick Men", step-by-step, through all stages of production, which is plodding and tedious, but it gives a realistic picture of the movie-making experience instead of concentrating on eventful highlights. I think the documentary will bore most viewers, but film students might find it educational. The audio commentary is good but a little awkward, because Ridley Scott and the Griffin brothers seem to have taped their contributions at different times. They talk about the genesis of the film and storytelling decisions that were made along the way, but not technical stuff. Ridley Scott's contributions are especially interesting. Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish, and dubbing is available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>A conman has a set of phobias that cause him discomfort.<br />He runs of of his medication and sees a new doctor<br />his friend knows about.

With teens flocking to see slocky special effects, there are fewer thoughtful films for the forty and up to see.  Cage in Adaptation and later Matchstick Men carries the flag for adult revelation movies.<br /><br />These types of film show the protagonist's messy life.  The revelation that your existence has hit a wall is usually catalyzed by an unusual event, for an example, Cage's 14 year-old daughter he has never seen has suddenly arrived in the midst of con-man shenanigans.  All hell breaks lose during a caper, and retro father-Cage has to make some mature decisions.  If I described the trick ending, and there is a trick ending, there would be a spoiler alert, but this film isn't so much a film about tricky cons, it's a revelatory of personality atrophy.<br /><br />Matchstick Men plays a little slow at times with good acting and fair-to-good swindle surprises.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage plays Roy, a con-man suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, and he will finally be outdone at his own game when his long lost daughter Angela (Alison Lohman) suddenly appears in his life. He should know well the way swindlers prey on your greatest weaknesses, but being weak to whatever that "thing" is, you don't see it until it is too late. The characters here are quirky, human and interestingly deceptive. Cage gives a performance more akin to those in his earlier career (read: better); he has been hit or miss-mostly miss-for ages now. Alison Lohman as his daughter is also excellent; her recent performances in White Oleander and Big Fish certainly attest to her talents. The frenetic and ultra-talented Sam Rockwell as Roy's partner/sidekick con-man Frank is certainly one to watch; his character here is ambitious, and one fault of the film (or perhaps just the short-sighted nature of its "hero" Roy) is that Roy places too much trust in Frank. Being con-men, who lie, cheat and steal for a living, I find it hard to believe that Roy would treat Frank as openly as he does, and see him as so innocuous. This fact even jumped out and hit me at the beginning of the film, so you can imagine where the story goes once Roy's life is turned upside down with the arrival of his "daughter".</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I was totally digging this film until the very end. It was well written and well directed (I mean, it's Ridley Scott, he's terrific). Nicholas Cage excells at playing neurotic, oddball characters like OCD-inflicted con-artist Roy, Alison Lohman was adorable and conniving as Angela, and Sam Rockwell was charming and smarmy as Roy's partner-in-crime. The relationship between Roy and Angela was endearing and interesting, and although the "twists" in the film's plot were really no surprise, they still worked pretty well. I just didn't buy Roy's compete moral 180 at the end of the film. I just don't think a person who's spent his life getting rich on the wrong side of the law would really be willing to give it all up for the life Roy chooses at the end of the film.<br /><br />But who knows? Maybe I'm just cynical.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>People are saying TOO MUCH about this movie in their reviews.  Watching the film will be more enjoyable the less you hear about it before viewing.  But if you must read a review, here is mine (free of spoilers):<p>Matchstick Men is one of the safest films to recommend in years.  While many people won't love it, almost everyone will enjoy it.  It is often funny, sometimes charming and always interesting.  Nicolas Cage plays a conman.  Much like in The Sopranos, his life is sorted into three areas: criminal activity, family and therapy.  <p>What makes this film different than most flim-flam films is that a film about Cage's character would be fascinating regardless of his profession.  He is obsessive compulsive, neurotic, depressed, unstable, etc.  Cage has the misfortune of following Jack Nicholson's turn as a similarly afflicted person in As Good As it Gets.  In his turn, Cage is no less convincing and brings a degree of humanity to the character that was missing from Jack's abrasive writer.  <p>I won't speak much about the plot of the film, but will only say his three worlds (job, family, therapy) constantly intersect and come together in a very satisfying ending.  The film has the look of a nice Armani  suit and is often accompanied by the smooth sounds of Sinatra.  Not to be missed is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance by Sam Rockwell as Cage`s understudy.  <p>Also featured on the DVD is a great commentary track by director Ridley Scott and writer Nicolas Griffin.  It is one of the most honest and forthcoming tracks I have ever heard.  They really do a fine job explaining the nuances of the script and give away a lot of reasons for decisions they made that many other artists would have kept secret.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be a fairly entertaining one to watch as the plot of the movie is a well thought out one involving a few twists here and there all culminating in the ultimate con that was not predictable at all; my only regret is not having caught this one in the theaters.<p>I've never really been a huge fan of Nicholas Cage but one cannot deny his versatility as an actor as he brings forth his extremely neurotic character in this film.  Performance wise, Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell and newcomer Alison Lohman all deserve high praise for their individual and collective efforts in this film.<p>Director Ridley Scott, best known for many great films such as &quot;Alien,&quot; &quot;Gladiator&quot; and a whole horde of other outstanding films steps in to direct this film and once again his talents as a skillful director shine as he takes us through the somewhat convoluted script, never revealing too much until the right time.  He deserves a great amount of credit for the success of this film.<p>The Premise:<p>Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage) is an extremely successful con man who has the home and the money to prove it however, he's also an extremely neurotic individual that had an unsuccessful relationship over fifteen years ago and hasn't attempted one since.  He suddenly finds that he needs to get some new anti depressants but now he has to go to a new doctor to get them and this psychologists actually wants him to talk about his problems which leads to him having a &quot;daughter.&quot;  In comes Angela (Alison Lohman), his &quot;daughter&quot; and now he's a parent.<p>What follows from there is a fairly entertaining film as we're treated to Nicholas Cage at his finest in portraying a lonely, neurotic man who suddenly has a daughter and still has his life as a con man to contend with...<p>I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who enjoy a good con/comedy that will have you guessing the direction of the film all the way to its conclusion.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Tricks of the Trade:  Making Matchstick Men<br />-Follow the Director through and intimate day-to-day account of the filmmaking process<br />*Part I:  Preproduction<br />*Part II:  Production<br />*Part III:  Postproduction<br />-Commentary by Director/Producer Ridley Scott, Writer Nicholas Griffin and Writer/Producer Ted Griffin<br />-Theatrical Trailer</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>Although the public responded moderately to this film (it grossed a little over 36 million), the critics sure did love this Ridley Scott (&quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;) con artist movie.<p> &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; has Nicolas Cage playing Roy Waller, a great con artist, but one messed up person. Waller is full of neuroses among his biggest problems is the fact he suffers from a major case of OCD.<p> &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; has a lot of plus sides to it. Cage, as most have already stated turns in a wonderful performance. He's alive and viberant. And it's a shame he didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, he's THAT good. Also Sam Rockwell does a nice job. The two have a lot of chemistry, both are fun to watch. As are some of the cons. Which really makes a movie like this. But, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; is playing around with a couple of ideas. One deals with Roy (Cage) and Frank Mercer (Rockwell) as a couple of con artist. The other deals with Roy as a man who makes Woody Allen seem tame. And the third story has Roy coming to realize he has a 14 year old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman). All of these outlines work well, at times, but the main problem I had with the film was the fact I was able to predict the ending. Any con moie you watch, you always know to expect a big twist at the end. That's just the way these films work. Watch Mamet films like &quot;Heist&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;, &quot;House of Games&quot; watch other movies like &quot;The Grifter&quot; and even the recent &quot;Confidence&quot;. So knowing that &quot;rule&quot; it was easy to guess what would happen. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; as I said does have its strong points but here's an odd case where a movie has a good execution but a so-so set-up. What I mean by that is the acting is fine, Scott's directing works, I liked the cinematography by John Mathieson, and at moments (mostly the first 45 minutes are so) the screenplay by Nicholas and Ted Griffin is enjoyable, but then the film becomes predictable. Or maybe it's predictable to a small number of people since film critic Roger Ebert openly said he did not see the ending coming. If he was lying or not I don't know.<p> So should you see this movie? Yes. I've named all of the film's appealing points. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; also keeps up Scott's winning record with me, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &amp; &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. This is a fun movie to watch, just remember, don't make the same mistake I did, and think about it too much. You'll spoil it for yourself.<p> Bottom-line: Entertaining con movie from Ridley Scott, that may not reach the level of other con films. Has strong performances from Cage, Rockwell, and Lohman. The only downfall to the movie is the predictable ending. Still worthwhile though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Highly entertaining film has one of Nic Cage's best performances to date.

The story of extremely neurotic but brilliant con man Nicolas Cage ("I'm not a criminal," he explains to his shrink, "Criminals hurt people; I don't..."), discovering a daughter he never knew he had (Alison Lohman, of WHITE OLEANDER), on the eve of a big 'Sting', offers as much emphasis on his acceptance of his new parental responsibilities as on the caper he and his partner (the always watchable Sam Rockwell) are pulling off. Cage plays the role brilliantly, making his quirky character sympathetic, and Scott proves again why he is one of Hollywood's premier directors.<p>The success of a film like this depends on the chemistry between the leads, and Cage and Lohman are terrific together. The young actress manages to be 'sweet' without being 'innocent', and the tentative steps she and Cage take to understand each other are both believable, and touching. In one scene, he attempts to prove to her that he can cook by preparing a spaghetti dinner...after one bite, the scene shifts to the arrival of the Domino's delivery boy!<p>Ultimately, however, MATCHSTICK MEN is a tale of 'The Con', and Cage and Rockwell's 'Sting' against 'fat cat' Bruce McGill, while appearing deceptively simple, has a series of twists and turns, leading to a climax that is both stunning and unexpected. This is the kind of movie that will have you putting pieces together, LONG after it ends.<p>It is an intriguing and rewarding film, and shouldn't be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage plays an obsessive-compulsive con-man in this extremely tedious film.

It did only fairly well at the boxoffice and was ignored at the yearend's awards feeding frenzy. This clever, subversive thriller from director Ridley Scott ["Gladiator", "Alien"] is a delight from start to finish. If it has a fault, it is that a plot twist near the end is so surprising and cruel that it was necessary to tack on a happy ending; however, said ending is both appropriate and logical, since the underlying theme is one of redemption.<p>Roy Waller [Nicolas Cage] is a lifelong con artist. He is a mass of nervous ticks, a walking definition of obsessive-compulsive disorder. His partner, Frank [Sam Rockwell] is calm, cool and collected. He puts up w Roy because Roy, is the master con. When Roy goes to a new shrink, it occurs to him that he may have had a child by his ex-wife fourteen years ago. The doctor verifies that he did, and Roy searches out the child, a bright, vivacious girl named Angela [Alison Lohman]. Father and daughter instantly bond. Meanwhile, Roy and his partner have the biggest con of their lives going on. At first a hindrance, Angela soon becomes a partner in crime, as though conning people was almost a genetic trait. <p>Cage, replete with nervous ticks and some speech impediments, is both funny and endearing as Roy, a con man who knows all too well the price his profession extracts from one's sole. Rockwell and Lohman are also excellent. <p>"Matchstick Men" is probably the most entertaining and rewarding thriller of 2003.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>Okay and who made it ? Waooo Ridley Scott ? tHAT'S THE GUY WHO MADE alien, NO ? Cool and who is the main actor ? Nicolas Cage ! Terrific !!!! Is he the guy who plaid in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and 8MM ...? oH yEAH bABY ! I will have a great moment...<br />THE END !<br />What the hell ! Much talent for so little flick ! It's so predictable.I knew what it will happen as soon as he met his daughter.It's disappointing and Cage is wasting his time and talent.I easily understand why he chose to be involved in ADAPTATION but this time,there is absolutely no reason.There is nothing to keep in mind.It's EMPTY.The twist has been seen in better movies and the end is simply kind of "I KNEW IT" It's not because they waste their time that you also have to.Give up ! And wait that it appears in your TV guide.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>"Matchstick Men" may not have been a box office success (compare it to the total gross of "National Treasure" [Cage's next film] and "Kingdom of Heaven" [Scott's next film]), but it certainly is one of the better-crafted & better-acted films to be associated with either of these men.  I was beginning to wonder if Cage could ever repeat a performance like what he did in "Leaving Las Vegas."  While his obsessive-compulsive con-man may not be the disaster along the lines of a suicidal alcoholic, he comes close with the impact he makes on the viewer.  This could easily have veered into caricature, but Cage creates a creditable & believable obsessive-compulsive.<br /><br />Perhaps this could be classified as a comedy, but it has an awfully bittersweet quality to it which makes the movie difficult to categorize with any ease.  The characters of Roy & Angela (a very very good performance by Alison Lohman, who is entirely believable as a 14-year-old) are real enough to cause the viewer to have a vested interest in their ultimate fate, as the movie takes numerous twists & turns.<br /><br />Ridley Scott did quite a good job at crafting a movie that avoids being too obvious, and which flows along nicely, maintaining viewer interest throughout.  This was a very satisfying film, through & through...I wish these two guys could make more like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Matchstick Men' is one of those movies that makes you realize why some actors have support.  Up until watching this film I had been a `Cage-Hater', a guy who just couldn't wrap his head around all the critical support (granted, I saw this movie before watching `Adaptation' and since watching that film I've realized this man `can' act, he just chooses not to half the time).  Here though Nicolas Cage gave me a brief glimpse of the man that everyone else sees.  As con-artist Roy Waller, Cage gives us a brilliant performance.<br /><br />My main problem with Cage has been his stiff natured acting, the fact that every time he speaks it feels as if he's reading a prompter card, and so I think that the fact that his character here suffers from a severe case of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) helps a lot in that regard since he's supposed to sound stiff and unnatural.<br /><br />Roy works with fellow con Frank (Sam Rockwell), the young hotshot prot&eacute;g&eacute; who has higher ambitions than Roy himself, and this is causing them to butt-heads a bit.  The real drama though comes in the form of Angela (Alison Lohman), a young 14-year old who claims to be his daughter.  At first Roy's put off and distant, but after Angela shows major interest in her fathers line of `work' they begin to bond by pulling small con-jobs together.  Meanwhile Frank is getting more and more agitated with the new bond between father and daughter because it's causing a strain on a big job they have coming up.<br /><br />Filled with twists and turns and an ending I never saw coming, `Matchstick Men' is the perfect kind of caper.  It's got great acting from a cast I never knew had it in them and a great moral message that manifests itself as the film unravels.  Alison Lohman is charming and natural and Sam Rockwell is the perfect side-kick, but the real shocker (at least to me) was the mere fact that Nicolas Cage steals the show from everyone!</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>This cross between "The Sting" and "Paper Moon" pits master con artist Roy (Nicholas Cage) against himself.  He has the smooth moves, the grasp of the intricate game he must play, the equally smooth partner (Sam Rockwell), but he cannot master his own obsessive-compulsive urges which manifest themselves in agoraphobia, tics, and, at times, full paralysis.  When his partner Mark insists that he sees a shrink for his problems, Roy makes halting progress, leading to his discovery of his previously unknown teenage daughter Angela (Alison Lohman.)  What happens next is both hilarious and heartbreaking as Cage exposes his character's heart tic by tic during his biggest con scheme yet.  <p>I cannot fault a single performance in this film.  No one plays comedic pathos the way Cage does, and he is at his absolute best here - even non-fans might be converted.  Supporting actress Alison Lohman's performance is bubbly, nuanced, and adorable, making Roy's instant affection for Angela completely believable.  The direction, screenplay, and other supporting performances add yet another layer of perfection to the film.  This is the kind of movie you can watch several times before you get enough of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>In the pantheon of con man movies (now almost a separate genre), Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men combines the witty geniality of The Sting with a little of the sardonic darkness of The Grifters and House of Games. Smoothly and impeccably done, it is the story of Roy, a master con artist whose unadmitted yet progessive guilt over his way of life has turned him into a seething, obsessive-compulsive neurotic. While his partner  (Sam Rockwell) keeps pressuring Roy to go for a big score, his therapist informs him of the existence of a long-lost teenage daughter (Alison Lohman)  from a brief, long-ago marriage. Roy's reaction to this news, his reunion with his daughter and her influence on his work comprise the story of Matchstick Men, a funny and resoundingly entertaining film with one of the most jaw-dropping surprise endings in recent memory. Rockwell and Lohman give excellent supporting performances, but it is Cage--one of the few actors who can go way over the top and take the audience with him--who steals the film with a comic performance that is perfect in every twitchy detail.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie, up until the end, but a few minutes after the film ended I decided that I really did like the ending. It all works. This movie is so funny and likeable that I don't think many people can turn away from it's endearing charm and wit.<p>Cage stars as Roy, a guy with a serious amount of nervous ticks and obsessive compulsive behaviors. He can never calm down-- it's like he's got caffeine for blood, which makes him a really fun character to be around for the couple hours the movie is. Roy is a con artist, pulling a big job with his partner Mark (Sam Rockwell-- who is absolutely amazing). Mark is annoyed that Roy can't even calm down when they're in the middle of a job so he tells Roy to see a shrink. Roy then learns he has a fourteen year old daughter, played by the magnificnet Allison Lohman. She's emotional, she smells like bubble gum, and she's in the way of Roy's life as a con artist. <p>The ending really is too good for words. It surprised the heck out of me, that's for sure. I never saw it coming. There's certainly a sadness to it, but it works so well I can't hardly complain. <p>Truly, this movie is worth watching. Cage playing a guy with so many ticks is irresistably funny, a tad annoying, and kind of sad all at the same time. This movie not only boasts alot of talent from it's actors, but an endearing story with an unexpected ending. I recommend this one to anyone who just wants to see an awesome movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I love Ridley Scott.  He is one of those directors who are capable of doing almost anything.  Sure, he has had some misfires in the past, and he will continue to have a few, but overall he has proven that he can sink into nearly any genre with ease and deliver something memorable.<br /><br />`Matchstick Men' is a light yet striking film that could stand tall with the best Scott has been able to produce.<br /><br />The film revolves around two con men, Roy and Frank, who find their operation flipped on its head with the sudden appearance of Angela.  This young teenager claims to be Roy's daughter.  This is news to him, but he learns to accept the possibility, and over time the two form a bond, especially when it becomes apparent that Angela possesses the same knack that Roy has for his `profession'.  Frank is less than thrilled about this new development, but he doesn't really have much of a say in the matter.<br /><br />Just wait for the twist!<br /><br />What I like so much about this film is that it possesses a light and airy vibe that suits the whole genre very well.  This is a `sting' film, a crime comedy that capitalizes on the swift humor to create a complete aura.  The visual style is very bleached, as if it has been sitting out in the sun too long.  I love that visual.  It's kind of like someone took the breezy feel of Woody Allen's `Vicky Cristina Barcelona' and baked it.<br /><br />I also give Scott credit for coaxing out of the cast some of their best work to date.  Everyone and their mother knows my dislike for Nicolas Cage.  He is such an unnatural actor.  That said, he has shone in films that capitalize on his ticks and force him to create something natural out of them.  This is one of his finest performances.  Using Roy's OCD as a building block, Cage actually creates a believable and engaging character in Roy.  Sam Rockwell is lauded by a lock of my cinephile friends, but I find him highly overrated.  Here he sinks into the dramedy aspect of the film effortlessly, and while it isn't a `standing ovation' type supporting role, he definitely `supports' the film very well.  Alison Lohman taps into Angela's soft side to great effect (it was needed to sell some of the more intimate aspects of her character development, and also that of Roy's).<br /><br />`Matchstick Men' is good breezy fun with a great (totally unexpected) twist that will leave you blindsided (and conflicted in your amusement).  This is definitely worth your time and attention.  You may have missed this one (it didn't get the publicity it deserved) but once you see it you won't forget it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I've heard good things about Ridley Scott's "Matchstick Men", released in 2003, but was reluctant to give it a try since it was about two con-men. It's hard, after all, to care about the outcome of a story if its main characters are swindling scumbags who make their living by ripping others off. Let 'em be wiped off the face of the planet for all I care. But everyone universally praised the film and said it had a good ending that catches the viewer off guard, so I finally decided to check it out.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage's character, Roy, is crippled by obsessive-compulsion disorder, likely a physical consequence of the guilt of his criminal lifestyle, which he tries to justify ("I don't take money from people; they give it to me"). He sees a shrink and relies on meds to deal with his condition. Ultimately Roy and his partner (Sam Rockwell) happen upon a big score. At the same time his life is complicated but also blessed by the appearance of a 14 year-old daughter he never knew he had (alison Lohman).<br /><br />The story is good all the way through but the last act & epilogue in particular are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I like how the movie emphasizes that love is more important than money, and more devastating to lose as well. And also that, if one truly has a worthy and noble heart, it will ultimately vomit out foolish, selfish and unnatural inclinations & actions. Redemption is always there, no matter how bad you are, but you have to want freedom enough to choose it and change.<br /><br />I don't want to say anymore because the less you know the better.<br /><br />The film runs two hours and was filmed in the Los Angeles/Anaheim/Venice areas.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Meet Roy and Frank, a couple of professional small-time con artists. What Roy, a veteran of the grift, and Frank, his ambitious protege, are swindling these days are "water filtration systems," bargain-basement water filters bought by unsuspecting people who pay ten times their value in order to win bogus prizes like cars, jewelry and overseas vacations, which they never collect. These scams net the men a few hundred here, another thousand there, which eventually adds up to a lucrative partnership. Roy's private life, however, is not so successful. An obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe with no personal relationships to call his own, Roy is barely hanging on to his wits, and when his idiosyncrasies begin to threaten his criminal productivity he's forced to seek the help of a psychoanalyst just to keep him in working order. While Roy is looking for a quick fix, his therapy begets more than he bargained for: the revelation that he has a teenage daughter, a child whose existence he suspected but never dared confirm. What's more troubling, 14-year-old Angela wants to meet the father she never knew. At first, Angela's appearance disrupts her neurotic father's carefully ordered routine. Soon, however, with his own unique spin on parenthood, Roy begins to enjoy a relationship he never dreamed of having with his daughter. But while he develops paternal feelings for the 14-year-old, she's developing a fascination with Daddy's questionable career. This is the kind of movie that will have you putting pieces together, long after it ends. It is an intriguing and rewarding movie, and shouldn't be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Matchstick Men is a story of one man by the name of Roy who is germophobic, is obsessive compulsive, and just happens to be a con man......<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays Roy, a man who is utterly brilliant when it comes to conning other people. However he considers himself to be a con "Artist," that is, he doesn't take people's money by force. He also absolutely despises harsh language, instead of using any bad word he simply says, "Oh Pygmies!"<br /><br />He is also obsessive compulsive; his rituals include closing and opening doors three times in a row while saying the numbers out loud, and sometimes even in a different language. He lives on keeping his carpet clean, sometimes reminding people three or four times to always take off their shoes before they step on the carpet.<br /><br />Roy's world is turned upside down when he realizes that his ex wife's 14 year old daughter [Allison Lohman] heard about him trying to talk to her mother and wants to meet him. In the few awkward moments that he meets his daughter, Roy feels drawn to her, in a sort of protective father figure.<br /><br />I found that the relationship with Roy and Angela, his daughter, was very heartwarming, and genuine. A father trying to make up for 14 years of not growing up with her, and a girl who is curious about her father's past and what he does, and also acts as a rebellious child. [But all teens act like that]<br /><br />It doesn't take long for Roy to start taking Angela on some of his cons to teach her after being pressured into it by her to begin with. One very good scene involves an old lottery ticket that won 600 bucks, only to have a woman give 300 to Angela for finding the ticket. But Roy's responsible parent comes into play and makes Angela give the money back.<br /><br />This is a great movie, one of the best of Nicholas Cage's career. His portrayal as a man who is desperate to be a father and to make his life simple is brilliant. The big twist at the end, which you can see clearly the second time you watch this movie, is done brilliantly as well.<br /><br />This is definately a movie worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>After directing some of the best Hollywood blockbusters,  Gladiator and Blackhawk Down, and having few flops along the way, G.I Jane, and Black Rain, Ridley Scott returns with Matchstick Men to a more intelligent, and much gentler character based movie making,the type of which he has excelled in Thelma and Louise.<br />I had no expectations about Matchstick Men, and while yet another 'con' movie would not have been a reason to watch it, the names Scott and Cage certainly compelled me to 'check it out' and I am so glad I did, because I can confidently say it is one of the best movies I have seen in the last two years, a film that I liken to a fine glass of wine, taken in few sips, and the after effects will be totally relaxing, and soothing.<br />The film while at the first glance does not seem to offer a lot, will grow on you unexpectedly and you'll carry it with you long after the credits roll.<br />And this is because of a fine collaborative effort from an excellent book by Eric Garcia, brilliant screenplay by Nicholas Griffin, a totally involved and sympathetic direction by Scott, and of course a mind blowing acting by Nick Cage, who yet again after Adaptation proves that he is more than capable of pulling off some of the most complex characters in cinema.Alison Lohman too proved more than capable of playing her equally complex character, an actress that has matured very well on screen.<br />The story of Matchstick Men seems simple enough, a phobic and neurotic Cage with a partner (Sam Rockwell) are small time con artists, who make their living by swindling housewives and lonely gullible men.<br />His carefully constructed world though will soon collapse with the reappearance of a long lost daughter,who will force him to break the wall he has built around himself, brick by difficult brick,and face emotions and intimacies he thought he was unable to have.<br />He goes through great personal turmoil in reestablishing his relationship with his 'daughter' who is interested in learning the trick of her dad's trade, while striving in the process to go straight.However, one last big con seems to ruin every hope or plan he had for his and his daughter's future.<br />Simple enough, until the twist at the end  when the final truth  is revealed,which came as a complete shock to me!<br />I loved how the change in Cage came about,how the neurosis which haunted his every move behavior and thought, were slowly undone one by one ,until he finally finds the peace of mind he so longed for.<br />The cons in my opinion are really trivial to the whole film and do not matter as much as Cage's transformation and realizations.At the end , it did not matter to me who that daughter really was, because she was able directly and indirectly to give Cage the break that he needed to change his life.<br />The ending was so serene and almost spiritual yet is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a while, because it says so much with so little language or explanations.<br />Matchstick Men therefore is a must see movie, one that will gently affect you by its top acting, writing and a director who can dazzle viewers with big productions but can also engage their minds and hearts with the simplest but most creative style.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>Matchstick Men is a very enjoyable movie with excellent characters and an even better story.  The story is about Roy, a obsessive compulsive small time conman.  Working with his partner Frank, they pull small scams on unsuspecting homeowners.  Everything in Roy's life is turned upside down when he meets his 14 year old daughter for the first time.  Also, he decides to go back to a big time scam on an acquaintance of Frank's.  At some point, Roy realizes he bonds with his daughter best when he is teaching her the tricks of the trade.  This is a great movie that has its funny and serious parts meshing them both together.  Hans Zimmer gives an excellent musical score reminiscent of Two Mules for Sister Sara as well as some Sinatra songs.  While the twist ending may disappoint a little, the movie is still very enjoyable and well worth a watch.<p>  Nicolas Cage gives an excellent performance as the obsessive compulsive con man Roy.  He twitches throughout the movie as we learn some of the things that send him on a spree.  Sam Rockwell is also very good as Roy's partner, Frank, who is really his only friend.  Alison Lohman plays Roy's daughter, Angela, while Bruce Altman is Roy's pyschiatrist.  The relationships between all these characters is very believable and the overall high point of the movie.  Bruce McGill also stars as the man Roy and Frank are targeting for their con.  Matchstick Men is a very enjoyable movie that at times will have you laughing and other times feeling other emotions for the characters.  Either way, this movie is well worth going to see!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott has directed several block buster films such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and Black Hawk Down (2002). Scott displays his talent for creating real characters in his films, which he refined in Thelma and Louise (1991). In Matchstick Men Scott pushes himself even further into the human psyche as the main character, Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage), is dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).<br /><br />The con-artist Roy Waller suffers from OCD as he goes about his daily business swindling innocent people with his partner Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell). Accidentally Roy drops his medication in the sink and goes into a cleaning frenzy as his OCD begins to run amok. Frank begins to worry about Roy and connects him with a psychiatrist. Through therapy Roy improves and soon he finds out that he has a daughter from a previous marriage. Roy is forced to deal with his OCD as he is about to confront his 14-year-old daughter he has never seen, and simultaneously pulls off the biggest con of his life before early retirement.<p>The story of Matchstick Men has been told before, but here is retold with a new twist. The new twist circulates around the psychological disorder that Nicholas Cage presents through wonderful acting. In addition, the cinematography projects a visual abstraction of the psychological disorder of Nicholas Cage's character, which enhances the visual experience. Scott also displays clues and hints of what is to come through detailed mise-en-scene. In the end, Matchstick Men offers a good, but not unique cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>For Nicolas Cage fans, MATCHSTICK MEN is a treat diluted only by the knowledge that Cage wasn't even nominated for an Oscar-worthy performance.<p>Cage is Roy, teamed with partner Frank (Sam Rockwell); both are con artists, or &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;. As the film opens, we watch as the two cash in on a scam that enables them to plunder the bank account of an elderly couple.<p>Roy is also an obsessive-compulsive with phobias for dirt and the outdoors. Without his medication, Roy gets twitchy. One day, he accidentally knocks his pill supply down the kitchen sink. Bad timing, since his psychiatrist drug supplier is out of town. On Frank's advice, Roy visits a new shrink, Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman), to whom he admits a previous marriage abandoned some fourteen years previous when his wife was pregnant. Through Klein's intercession, Roy is put in touch with his teenage daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman), who's always been curious about Old Dad. Indeed, against her Mom's wishes, she appears on Roy's doorstep to spend a long weekend. Roy is alternatively smitten with paternal affection and acute anxiety over the dirt Angela tracks onto his carpet. Klein believes the girl's presence is good therapy.<p>MATCHSTICK MEN is about scammers and cons, so, by the time the credits roll, you shouldn't be too surprised at the general storyline, which is one oft seen before. What elevates the film is the intensity of Cage's extraordinary performance as the mentally tortured lead. We've watched Nicolas do this previously in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. Cage is apparently not one for whom a role is simply a facade easily sluiced away at the end of the day's shoot. Cage always makes me believe the screen character is himself through to the core, something which either makes the actor one of the most talented in the Biz or a schizo seriously in need of professional help.<p>The other remarkable performance in this film is that of Lohman. Playing the 14-year old Angela, one is apt to forget, or not believe, that the actress is actually in her mid-twenties. She had me fooled.<p>MATCHSTICK MEN is perhaps one you'll want to see a second time to locate the key sequence where you yourself were fooled. This is first-rate entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller gives the most entertaining performance of a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder since Jack Nicholson in &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;.  Cage is nearly paralyzed by his condition, in particular when he is out of his medication.  The early scenes establish his condition and his occupation as a con artist, and there is a steller sequence which begins when he clumsily dumps his medications into kitchen sink and commences a series of panicked phone calls to get refills after hours.  There are several hilarious scenes between Cage and Bruce Altman as Roy's Psychiatrist.<p>Sam Rockwell as Roy's con-man partner Frank Mercer gives another performance that signals his emergence as an American A-list actor. Alison Lohman is very appealing as the daughter Roy never met.<p>The first act of the film introduces these three characters and the second develops Roy's relationship with his daughter.<p>The third act builds around an elaborate con that the three of them have cooked up, and by the end of the film you see that the con worked exactly as one of them planned.  I don't plan to give any twists away but I will say expect some - twists that is.<p>Ridley Scott directs and adds another jewel to a resume that already sparkles with &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;, &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>I found the extra feature, an extended take on how director Ridley Scott made the movie, to be more interesting than the actual film, which I had to pause a few times to get through. Nicolas Cage's various tics here as an obsessive-compulsive are uncomfortable to watch, though his performance is great, as usual for Cage. The sets in suburban Los Angeles were interesting to look at. Even the Sinatra soundtrack - why, really? - wasn't bad. I guess it was the plot that let me down. Also, is it a comedy or a character study? You find out in the extra that this question vexed the post-production, as well. The major plot twist that occupies the final 20 percent of the film wasn't all that surprising. A passing entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Matchstick Men was much better than I thought it was going to be. As soon as I saw that Nicolas Cage was playing a con man with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) I thought it would get tedious in no time, but Cage handled it well. OCD was an important aspect of his character, and it also influenced the outcome. Cage won an Oscar for playing an alcoholic who is "Leaving Las Vegas" and his performance here is up near that level. He really has a knack for playing afflicted characters.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell, as Frank, his partner, was pretty good; but Alison Lohman, as his daughter, Angela, was spectacular. There are tender moments between the daughter and her estranged father that are really touching, and that is hard to do. How easily it becomes cloying if handled wrong. Alison as Angela was very believable as the daughter, who has inherited her father's gift for grift.<br /><br />Matchstick Men continually surprises, and that is good. Nothing is as it seems, and there are some really clever twists. Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, really knows his business. There was great choices of music throughout. Frank Sinatra, The Tijuana Brass, Nino Rota, Bobby Darin, Roxy Music, Kid Rock, and more. Each song was carefully chosen and placed so it commented on the action, but didn't really draw attention to itself and away from the story, because it just seemed so right for the moment.<br /><br />Bottomline is Matchstick Men is a good film from Ridley Scott, but it is not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729628">Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)</a>. It has a great performance from Nicolas Cage, but not quite as good as Leaving Las Vegas. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304981643">The Grifters</a> is a better movie about con artistry, and Matchstick Men is not quite that good, but it comes very close.

Adapted from the novel written by Eric Garcia, "Matchstick Men" is a hidden gem that did not receive much critical consideration or buzz, but will undoubtedly make you laugh and think at the same time.<p>Roy (Cage) is a virtuoso con-man who is overwhelmed by his psychological disadvantages that consist of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder; he is very monetarily successful, but his problems have left him with no social acquaintances except his partner Frank (played by Sam Rockwell), a devastating divorce, and an increasing dependence on his psychologist (Bruce Altman).  Amidst planning for their biggest score against a wealthy, unsuspecting mark (Bruce McGill), Roy's world is thrown upside down when a young fourteen year-old girl (Alison Lohman) steps through the threshold of his frantic world and claims to be the daughter that he has never met.  Roy is torn between making the biggest score of his live or changing his ways and perspectives to focus more on his newfound relationship with the young woman.  Surprisingly to Roy, his daughter has an incredible knack for the dubious crimes that he and Frank are accustomed to committing-prompting Roy to include her in their con scheme.<p>Director Scott creates a hip, energetic film with similar undertones to his 1991 film "Thelma and Louise", using some excellent dialogue and twists and turns to create an intellectual comedic caper that sniffs similarities of "The Sting".  Nicholas Cage is very good in his role as the neurotic crook, but his engaging relationship with the stand-out Lohman makes the film very entertaining.  A film that will certainly stimulate the mind and the funny bone-well worth the trip.  The 72-minute "Tricks of the Trade" is produced by Ridley Scott and is a very informative and interactive feature on the DVD, allowing viewers to parade through a variety of options, including interview segments, deleted scenes and ego-massaging.  An especially pleasurable flick!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>Have you ever had a really great prank played on you? No matter how funny the prank actually is, its been played at your expense and so you laugh heartily, but inside you're pretty pissed off?  That's how I felt sitting through Ridley Scott's MATCHSTICK MAN.  A film that's so good, and yet in the end, goes one step too far.<p>The story stars Nicholas Cage (Adaptation) as Roy Waller, a con-artist with what seems like OCD.  He can't help but clean things; he a tad bit crazy that way.  His partner in crime is Frank (Sam Rockwell, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind); he's the brawn of the operation to Roy's brains.  Frank spends most of the movie setting up people, and Roy goes in for the kill.<p>When Roy runs out of his medication, he goes to a shrink to get some more.  Only to face the fact that he wishes he had a relationship with his daughter (Alison Lohman, White Oleander).  Eventually the two meet and they strike up a relationship.  Pretty soon she's in on some of Roy and Frank's con jobs.<p>MATCHSTICK MEN is a brilliantly conceived movie that refuses to remain at all conventional.  Roy and his daughter Angela have this unique and fun relationship.  It's great to watch a man fight his quirks for the people he loves.  I loved that the moment Angela shows up on Roy's doorstep that his immaculate house is dirtied and yet Roy doesn't seem bothered by it.  That's real progress.<p>Nicholas Cage does a fine job as Roy.  He walks the thin line between a real person and a cartoon so well, you sometimes forget you're looking at the guy from SNAKE EYES.  He plays these larger than life characters with so much vigor you forget he's acting.  <p>Cage is best in the small scenes in the Supermarket.  There is this beautiful women (Shelia Kelley, Nurse Betty) that Roy really loves.  They have this connection with so few words.  Like they long to spill their life stories out at each other, but they just say hi to each other and that's almost enough.  When Roy finally asks her name it's like a floodgate has open, and he is a man reborn.<p>What bugs me about this film is that I'm not sure about the ending.  It's everything I have ever wanted in a movie and yet it left me cold.  It's hard to explain why because it would ruin the movie.  But I guess it's an important lesson in the fact that "there is no such thing as a free lunch", and "what you sow, must also you reap."  <p>Now that I think of it, this film reminds me so much of the outcome of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Of course Alex deserved what he got in the end, but don't you feel sorry about it.  Roy is not a good person, he's taken advantage of everyone who he's come into contact with, but can loving one person be enough penance for a lifetime of sins? <p>All in all Ridley Scott sets a nice light tone on what otherwise could have been a more standard gritty and dramatic picture.  His visual style is really close to Noir without the faded fedoras and the stanch seriousness.  It's definitely one of those films that will have a hard time being jammed into just one genre category, and that's okay with me.<p>Why not give MATCHSTICK MEN a look, you may be left scratching your head in the end, but at least it's a compelling ride.<p>**** out of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Nic Cage and Sam Rockwell are excellent and both deserve Oscar Nominations. Alison Lohman who is really over 22 in real life is great and believable as the innocent 14 year old daughter of Nic's character. This movie is done in the same light tone as "Catch Me If You Can," the only difference being that it is way better. The only small problem I have with the movie is the cheesy tacked on ending that follows the words..ONE YEAR LATER. I would actually suggest leaving the theater instead of watching the last 10 mins. The original ending ends on a depressing but realistic note following a series of plot twists, which was great for me. The tacked on ending is too sappy and detracts from realism of the characters we have gotten to know over the past 2 hours. Basically the ending was too "hollywood" for me and the other people I saw it with. But we all agreed, ending aside, this is one of the best and funniest films of the year. Let the Oscar nods roll.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>2003 was a great year for movies. With classics such as About Schmidt, 25th Hour, Adaptation, Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Punch Drunk Love, I was finally given the best film of the year so far. Matchstick Men.<p>Matchstick Men stars Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller. Ridden with ticks and obsessive complusion disorder, Roy keeps his house extremly organized. Roy is a con man(con artist!) and he and his partner Frank have been doing small jobs. But Frank wants to bring Roy into a big job. To dupe a man Chuck Frechette into a currency enchange con. But Roy drops his medicine down the drain and the shortage of his ILLIGAL med's causes him to go over the edge with his problem. Frank suggests that he see a shrink and he meets Dr. Klein and we find out that Roy ws married and that he might have a 14 year old daughter. Klein calls his ex wife to find out because Roy has problems talking to her. And Roy meets his 14 year old daughter Angela. <p>Angela like his tics and his disorder. But when he tells her what he really does for a living(he says he's an antique's broker) and she forces him to teach her the tricks of the trade. But the help in the latest con goes wrong, with surprising results.<p>Matchstick Men was excellant. I loved everything and everyone about it. It had a plot with three story lines so if one plotline goes out there are always fallbacks. But non of the storylines ever leaves you uninterested. The first storyline is Roy's problem with his illness. The second one is Frank and Roy's con. The third is the more personal storyline about Roy and his relationship with his new found daughter. The movie drifts from comedy, to suspense, to heart. With an ending that is so unexpected you would never see it coming. There are no hints of it in the advertising for you to even guess that it is coming. <p>Go see Matchstick Men. No question. It is no doubt the best film of the year 2003 so far and along with the lists of the best films of all time. Great acting by Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell, and Loyman playing his daughter, with a great score by composer Hans Zimmer. Matchstick Men is the kind of movie that I've been waiting for and it finally came. I am patently waiting for it to come to DVD, because I'm getting on the first day.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, violence, some sexual content and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Nicholas Cage plays Roy, a quirky con man struggling with OCD, whose life is turned upside down by the sudden arrival of Angela (Alison Lohman), who claims to be his 14-year-old daughter that he didn't even know existed.  When Angela takes an interest in her father's profession, Roy allows her to take part in a job that he's running with his parner (Sam Rockwell).  The tables are quickly turned and it becomes unclear who's conning who in this fast-pace "dramedy" that will keep the audience guessing until the very end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Ridley Scott<p>With the track record of Ridley Scott in mind (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Thelma and Louise, Black Hawk Down), any time the man makes a new movie I am automatically interested in it.  He has a history of creativity and excellence in filmmaking and any new movie that he directs is worth giving a chance.  It was with high expectations that I went into "Matchstick Men", a story of a con-artist.  <p>Roy (Nicolas Cage) and Frank (Sam Rockwell) are partners in the art of conning people out of their money.  As Roy explains in the film, he doesn't steal people's money, they give it to him.  They are mainly working small phone scams for smaller payouts (though Roy seems to be well off considering the size of his house), but Frank is looking to get a big score, which Roy agrees to work.  Simple enough, but Roy also has some serious issues.  He is compulsive (he must turn the locks or open and close doors three times before actually opening the door all the way), somewhat manic, and he has trouble dealing with the outdoors.  Neatness/cleanliness is another issue.  Roy is a man with tics.  <p>Into this imperfect, but somewhat structured life comes a big change: Roy's daughter Angela (Alison Lohman).  When Roy accidentally knocks his supply of medication down the drain, Roy has to start searching for a psychologist who will prescribe some more on short notice.  The doctor he does find also suggests that Roy gets in contact with his daughter, whom he has never met.  Angela is a breath of fresh air into Roy's otherwise empty life, but it is also causing some conflict into the big con that Roy and Frank are working on.  <p>My expectations may have been too high, because I wasn't overly impressed with "Matchstick Men".  For the first half to two thirds of the movie, I just could not engage with the characters.  Part of the problem probably lies in the fact that I do not care for Nicolas Cage as an actor.  It just seems like he is trying too hard to create a character through personality tics (with the notable exceptions of Leaving Las Vegas, and The Family Man).  His characters are just not likeable, or interesting enough for me to engage with, but I understand that this is just a personal perception.  <p>The shining star of the movie is Alison Lohman (also in White Oleander) who was nearly 10 years older than the age she was playing in the movie.  She can act and look so young and vulnerable despite being in her mid 20's.  The rest of the acting was well done (though I still don't care for Cage), but it didn't all come together like I would have expected.  The idea of the "con" runs throughout the entire movie and there are several twists along the way, but this is a fairly lightweight movie up until about three quarters of the way through the movie when it completely changes in tone (and oddly enough becomes a better movie).  I hoped for so much more from "Matchstick Men", but I didn't think it lived up to the promise of what it could have been with the talent involved.  <p>-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>A decently made drama from beginning to end. The film starts slow but then takes on a brilliant flow, from the beginning itself, you are easily glued to the screen, totally engaged in the characters, specially 'Roy' played brilliantly by Nicholas Cage, 'Roy' is a person who will communicate to you with just his eyes and facial expressions and Cage effortlessly breathes enough life into the character, making this one of his best performances without a doubt and it is actually 'Roy' you are witnessing and not the actor Nicholas Cage. Surprisingly brilliant performance from Alison Lohman who plays 'Angela'. The chemistry between Cage and Lohman are just enough to get you involved in the whole scenario of the film. A similarly good performance from Sam Rockwell as well. 'Matchstick men' will surely draw you to its situations, the moods and mostly its characters. A tiny little gem of a film, not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell played Roy and Frank, con artists with Roy teaching Frank everthing he knew. In came Alison Lohman, Roy's never met 14-year old daughter Angela, who reestablisehd Roy's link with the real world. Just when Roy was willing to break his rule - he ventured into the danger zone and did one last big job with Frank, he put his as well as Angela's life in danger. One would even assume the 3 will pull it off...<br /><br />The movie is much more interesting when Angela showed up. Alison Lohman is natural, eager and smart as her papa. Only she was actually 22 when she played the 14-year old. So she is blessed with the youthful look but delivered a sophisticated role. The movie ended up with an upbeat note, with Nicholas Cage losing a lot but gaining something he has never had before.<br /><br />I like the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This was a bit different: a con movie that stays pretty low-key with some humor and a nice father-daughter story and then - wham - the last half hour it turns violent and very serious.<br /><br />****possible spoilers ****Frankly, I didn't particularly care for the last few minutes. I'm not opposed to forgiveness, it's what we all are supposed to do, but I also am a proponent of justice....which doesn't happen here with Allison Lohman's role as "Angela."<br /><br />All the characters are very interesting and the story is involving. It hooks you in early on, and keeps your wondering what will happen. There is a nice soundtrack to this film, too, and the camerawork is first-rate. The bad news is that, once again we see a film in which they make good guys out of crooks and the lead good guy "Roy Waller" (Nicholas Cage) smokes the whole movie. When is Hollywood to stop promoting bad things (like smoking)?<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for something entertaining and a little bit different, this is recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Matchstick Men" is a film that you think you've got a beat on but takes twists that are clever and make for an ultimately satisfying experience.  The movie introduces us to Roy, a con artist with OCD.  Your first thought is, "uh-oh we're in "Monk" territory".  Then Roy's long lost daughter is introduced into his life and Roy starts to re-evaluate the choices he has made in light of him now being a responsible father.  Just when you thought you've got the rhythms of this movie down twists straight of a David Mamet thriller are thrown into the mix.  Nicolas Cage is superb as Roy and Alison Lohman is his equal as Angela, his long-lost daughter.  Kudos also have to be given to director Ridley Scott here.  Scott is known primarily as a director of big-budget epics and sci-fi thrillers("Thelma and Louise" not withstanding).  It's refreshing to see him succeed in another genre, whatever genre you could categorize this film as.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott is one of the top directors in the world. That's undeniable , but what happened with this one?<br />The plot is boring , even ridiculous . Nicolas Cage is perfect in his role but the script goes to nowhere . This film seems inspirated for House of games and a moral lesson for fathers. And the film remains in the middle of the road.<br />I couldn't believe this film carried the signature of Ridley Scott.<br />A minor movie for a status director . As you see the marriage can not result in a happy ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Nicholas Cage plays Roy a man with so many nervous ticks he could be the atomic clock. Roy's house, the muisc he listens to (Frank Sinatra) and his very essence has been imported from the early 60's into the 21st Century. Unfortunately, Roy lives a life trapped in routine; he suffers from an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder caused by the way he lives his life; he's a flimflam man, a con man with more cons than a cardshark has aces up his sleeve. Roy's obsessive compulsive behavior and tics are out of control because his supplier of medication has skipped town. Without his illegally obtained medication, Roy is out of control and goes into extreme cleaning mode. He can't function and he can't work because his nervous ticks and behavior will give him away.<p>His obnoxious and messy partner Frank (the marvelous Sam Rockwell) urges him to see a shrink.  Now he must see a real doctor and discuss his very real problems something very much against his nature. His new psychiatrist Dr. Klein manages to get Roy on the couch just long enough to discover that Roy has a daughter he's never seen and an ex-wife that has told more lies than she has fingers about his whereabouts. Dr. Klein urges Roy to contact his daughter suggesting part of his problems may be related to the fact that he has no one to relate to and leads a solitary, lonely life. Roy's life takes both a turn for the better and the worse as his daughter turns out to have a talent for conning all her own...<p>&quot;Matchstick Men&quot; plays almost like a dysfunctional variation on &quot;The Sting&quot; with quirky, nebbish characters at its heart. Director Ridley Scott (&quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;) shows he has a deft ability with comedy in this unique film.  His clever use of 60's and 50's stylistic touches and Cage's rich performance make &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; instantly memorable and enjoyable. All the members of the supporting cast are of an equal caliber. Rockwell steals many of the scenes he shares with Cage, which is quite an accomplishment, and Allison Lohman does a great job playing Roy's seemingly sweet but manipulative daughter. The plot features enough twists and turns for a high-grade roller coaster.  Kudos must also be given to screenwriters Nicholas and Ted Griffin for their sardonic and rich screenplay. While the audience can see where the film is leading well before the final third of the film creating sympathy for some very unsypathetic characters, Scott and his cast make the ride as entertaining as possible.<p>The rich and colorful transfer of &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; looks exceptional. The warm colors of Southern California come across in the rich cinematographer by John Matheison and are faithfully reproduced on the DVD as well. <p>Viewers won't get burned with the extras on this single disc, dual layer edition. There's an in-depth feature length documentary focusing on the entire process of making a motion picture. It's a fascinating glimpse into the process of making a motion picture for film fans.  There's also a interesting commentary track from Scott and the screenwriters. <p>A funny, entertaining movie with some very cool and unique extras, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; shows that Scott way with comedy. Cage, Rockwell, Lohman and McGill all give funny, detailed performances that are highlighted in the marvelous commentary as well as the production featurettes. The sharp transfer looks exceptional despite some minor digital blemishes. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; is definitely worth picking up, as you'll enjoy the rich, detailed world that Scott and his collaborators have created.</p></br></body></html>

Jamie Foxx plays an FBI agent in charge of a small band of agents (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Cris Cooper) investigating, without State Department approval, a Saudi bombing which has cost the lives of one of their friends and hundreds of civilians.  During the investigation, they are watched over by Saudi policeman, Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom), a man assigned to control their every move in the spirit of protection.  Of course, this being a Hollywood thriller set in Saudi Arabia, the Americans take matters into their own hands to overcome bureaucracy and corruption and to pursue the villains.<br /><br />Barhom plays his character with real humanity, and he steals every scene with his no-nonsense approach, tinged with idealism and hope for real justice.  The Americans all do competent acting jobs, although their roles seem too predictable given the plot.  The chase scenes are heart-stopping and somewhat over-the-top, but they keep this fast-paced flick moving from first moments to last.  The message driven home, that we are two peoples fighting and corrupting future generations, is laid over-the-top of what is an essentially go-blow-up-the-bad-guys plot. Nuances such as diplomacy, culture, and history are quickly lost in the gunfire.<br /><br />Certainly, this film entertains the way the best in the genre does; however, it tries too hard at times and not hard enough at others.  I recommend this for a one-time viewing.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Peter Berg's The Kingdom does many things right but unfortunately it does many things wrong as well. As a political thriller/ police procedural it hits many of the right notes. It shows us that there are good people and bad people in all cultural situations.<br /><br />The first two thirds of the film are quite good. A terrorist organization has attacked an American workers compound in Saudi Arabia and an elite FBI response team must get into the secretive country to find the criminals who planned the attack. The American team is led by Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) and includes a forensic expert (an underused Jennifer Garner); an intelligence expert (Jason Bateman) and an explosives expert(Chris Cooper). Once in country the team meets their Saudi counterparts  Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom) and Sergeant Haytham (Ali Suliman).<br />The two groups begin to build a relationship of trust that allows them to go after the terrorist leader and bomb maker, Abu Hamsa (Hezi Saddik).<br /><br />Perhaps the geatest flaw with the film is that its last third becomes nothing more than an extended gun battle that wraps things up too easily for my tastes. The film ends on a note that the violence will continue as both sides are entrenched in a kill them all attitude. As stated Berg does any things right in this film but it could have been much better.<br /><br />I viewed the HD disc that had excellent picture and sound. The special features included three deleted scenes in HD, an extended featurette on the car crash sequence, a detailed making of the film featurette, a timeline on events in the Middle East, and an excellent commentary by Berg.<br /><br />The Kingdom had the potential to be one of the best political thrillers of 2007 but unfortunately just missed its goal. The film is well worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Very intense and well written action/thriller movie, not to mention good acting (Danny Huston has become one of my new 'actors to watch for' after seeing his portrayal of the creepiest vampire I've ever seen in '30 Day's of Night' at the box office). In 'The Kingdom', a team of FBI agents must struggle to gain permission to investigate a tragic bombing at a base where many American oil workers lived in Saudi Arabia. The team faces an uphill battle, walking a tightrope between diverse politics and cultures. It's worth at least a couple viewings, and the final scene is a real 'nail biter'.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

The governments explanation that the people of the US want it that way is so ridiculous it isn't funny. The OIL companies and the CAR companies want it that way and the lobbyist and the donations to campaigns help keep it that way. But that aside this movie is an excellent look into the US involvement in Saudi Arabia. It shows the powder keg that everyone is involved in there and it is not in the least bit superficial about it. It shows how our involvement started and how we continue it to protect what has become a national security interest since our cars and planes need the oil.<br /><br />Synopsis: After men disguised as Saudi Police attack and bomb a compound of Americans and kill hundreds, the FBI pressures the country into letting four FBI agents investigate the site. When it is obvious it will only be allowed with blinders they pressure the local police and develop a repoire and eventually find those responsible. I applaud the movies insight and character development. I truly felt the pain of the people on both sides. If you enjoy movies like "Blackhawk Down" you will definitely want to catch "Kingdom". Cudos again to another wonderful Jamie Foxx performance. The DVD quality is excellent and this movie has good replayabilty.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Tensions in the Middle East are nothing new and attacks on Americans have taken place more often than not on foreign soil rather than here at home. But until now, few movies have been made focusing on attacks abroad. All that changes with THE KINGDOM.<br /><br />At a U.S. base in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a terrorist attack leaves many involved at a weekend softball game/cookout dead or wounded. To add insult to injury, as the investigative team on site tries to put together what happened, a second bomb explodes leaving more devastation and the team dead.<br />In Washington, D.C., word returns to the main offices of the FBI. Close friend to one of the victims who was asked moments before the attack to come help, Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx). Fleury breaks the news to fellow terrorists' agents and then request to take a team in to look for clues. Denied due to bureaucratic maneuverings, Fleury goes beyond normal channels to influence both the U.S. government and the Saudi government to allow his team in. Granted 5 days, they set out for Riyadh.<br />Assigned to work with the team, or rather to watch over them, Col. Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom) is as interested in catching those responsible as Fleury. It was in the guise of his soldiers that the terrorists began the attack.  More red tape prevents Fleury and his team from doing what they want, but eventually they have the chance and when they do, the pieces of the puzzle begin to come together.<br />As the team tries to find the solution to the explosion, the same terrorists look at their arrival as another chance to strike a blow at the U.S. and the House of Saud. Preparations begin to launch a second attack via bomb at the team before they can leave. Which team will find the other first and accomplish their goal is what makes this movie a taut thriller that has you in its grip from beginning to end.<br />Foxx shows that he is a commanding force to be reckoned with on screen. He has substantial support in the actors that make up Fleury's team (Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). And Barhom does an excellent job as the man in the middle, trying to remain loyal to his country and help his new friends at the same time.<br />With the Middle East the powder keg that it is, this movie is both controversial and perfectly timed for release. And best of all it doesn't take a political stance at all but focuses on the facts and the story of a law enforcement team trying to do what it does best. Offering entertainment, enlightenment, information and white knuckled action make this movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>The Kingdom is definitely the best movie I've seen in a long time. An involved, modern day, sophisticated story; emotionally charged; suspenseful; fast paced and action packed; believable, great acting by great actors....What more can you ask for from a movie in an industry that seems to have forgotten how to deliver a great film?<br /><br />Fan of the series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UX6TIO">CSI: Las Vegas</a> will love The Kingdom. A team of FBI agents led by Jamie Foxx is sent to Saudi Arabia to help with the investigation into an attack on a major US oil company's housing compound. The attack kills hundreds of civilian men, women and children, along with FBI agents which makes it personal for Foxx's team.<br /><br />Foxx and crew struggle with cultural barriers and political red tape to get their job done...and the clock is ticking. They are given 5 days in the country to solve the crime before they will be sent home.<br /><br />While the acting is believable, once the immediate impact of the movie wears off, you realize that some of the scenes and storyline are a real stretch. There are some death defying car crashes, shootouts that you only survive in a video game and quick ends to those that are in charge of the trouble. I mean, geez, if it's as easy as a CSI episode to catch a terrorist, let's send Jamie Fox or Marg Helgenberger over to capture Bin Laden.<br /><br />Importantly, The Kingdom keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and thoroughly entertained from start to finish. Worthy of purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>I thought this was a well done movie with very few exceptions. There was just a little unbelievableness throughout the movie. The ending couldn't have been better! The language, death scenes, and intense drama keeps this one from being for the whole family.<br /><br />An oil companies compound is attacked by a terrorist group. Three American FBI agents go to Saudia Arabia to help with the investigation. Josh Harnet's role is a short one! Jennifer Garner needs to wash out her potty mouth and maybe her part could have been more fulfilling. She barely said anything but the "f" word. Jamie Fox does a really good job and brings this cast together!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I've read a BBC review about "The Kingdom," dubbing it "Syriana Meets Black Hawk Down." In whatever way you may describe this new Peter Berg film, it is obvious that the film tries to blend more than two elements in one story. Among them actions are most successful though the same cannot be said about its political "Syriana" aspect. The film tries to make a point as to American/Saudi Arabian politics in the Middle East, but I still am not sure what that really could be.<br /><br />After a brief montage section introducing us to the US-Saudi Arabia history, "The Kingdom" starts with a series of bloody and violent scenes of terrorist attack in the American facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The film convincingly shows the horrible results of the attack, which may be painful for some to see. Then after some negotiation (or threat) with Saudi Arabia, one elite FBI team is allowed to fly to Saudi Arabia to investigate the case that killed its agents.<br /><br />The team consists of Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. It is an unlikely scenario especially when you see Jennifer Garner's agent casually wears a pretty tight shirt there and the investigation part is not particularly interesting, but the interactions between American agents and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi of Saudi Arabian Police Force (effectively by Ashraf Barhom) almost make up for the lack of events and movement in the middle part of the story.<br /><br />The film includes an extended battle scene in the street and building, which looks like that of "Black Hawk Down." Director Peter Berg uses a shaky camera to capture the confusion of the place, and while some may think it is successful in creating tension, you just may not like this method as detracting. Whichever way you may feel, the actions are effective, if slightly repetitious.<br /><br />All in all "The Kingdom" is a successful thriller, but not entirely so with some sections that are simply too good to be true. Those parts, I'm afraid, might also have lessened the weight of its political messages.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Kingdom" is excellent!

More than 100 people die, including some FBI agents.  In the US, Ronald Fleury (Foxx) gets his forensic team ready for an investigation.  They consist of: Janey Mayes (Garner, a pathologist; Adam Leavitt (Bateman), a computer expert; and Grand Sykes (Cooper), an explosives expert.  His team is allowed into Saudi Arabia, but they have to be watched by police-colonel Al-Ghazi (Barhom).  Of course, he is more intent on keeping the peace than getting to the bottom of things, and as Fleury and his team get closer to the answers they are looking for, things begin to spiral out of control.<br /><br />"The Kingdom" is an excellent movie that is both intelligent and suspenseful.  It is well acted all around, and especially by Jason Bateman.  He has the meatiest role, and gives a strong dramatic performance.  He also gets the best one-liners.  The story and direction are top notch.  The movie is tense and urgent, pulling the viewer in with ease.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>After a brief, graphic enhanced look at the history of "The Kingdom", a terrorist group attacks a Western housing complex in Saudi Arabia. The families are playing a game of softball in what they believe is a protected area, heavily guarded. But the terrorists disguise themselves as Saudi Police, get in, cause a lot of havoc and cost a lot of American lives. The State department, led by Attorney General Gideon Young (Danny Huston) is reluctant to send anyone in and FBI Director James Grace (Richard Jenkins) follows the edict. But Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) knows he has to get his team there yesterday; the longer they wait, the less chance they have of recovering any evidence. He meets with and manages to convince the Saudis it is in their best interest to allow the team into the country, onto their soil. Fleury takes Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), the FBI's munitions expert, Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), their intelligence expert and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), their internet and web guy. There, they meet Colonel Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), a member of the Saudi police, who has been personally charged by the Prince to care for the Americans, and his assistant Sergeant Haytham (Ali Sulman). On the ground, they face a number of restrictions until they are finally able to take a look and start to convince people they are serious about their investigation.<br /><br />"The Kingdom", directed by Peter Berg (a former TV actor who now directs TV and movies, "Friday Night Lights") and written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, is a surprisingly effective thriller. Combining a number of different styles of film, "Kingdom" works a large percentage of the time and manages to paint a portrait evocative of the problems we have in that part of the world. It isn't a perfect film, but what it gets right, it does well.<br /><br />Despite a couple of heavy action moments, the film really strives to be a political thriller. And it succeeds. The opening moments, a graphical "Complete Idiot's Guide" to the history of the Kingdom, manage to quickly paint a portrait of the constant back and forth shaping the history, politics and landscape of this region. This is both a necessary and effective way to set up the environment the American FBI team will encounter when they arrive in Saudi Arabia. No one wants them to go there because they are very concerned about our relationship with the Saudis and the flow of oil from their country to ours. When they arrive, they are told they may walk through the crime scene, but not touch anything or remove anything. Of course, this will hamper their investigation, so it meets with some resistance. Once they arrive on the scene, Damon Schmidt (Jermey Piven), from the State Department drives up ready to intercept, and immediately begins to make arrangements for them to leave. He can't see any good from their visit, so he rushes them from one site to the next. As we watch all of this, it makes sense and further reinforces what we are learning about the history of the region and, more importantly, our involvement in the shaping of this history. Then, in the film's final moments, these previous scenes really pay off with a resonance you won't soon forget.<br /><br />From the moment they arrive in Saudi Arabia, the American FBI team is escorted by Colonel Al Ghazi. There is a reason for this. The Americans are not safe and as much as the Saudis don't want them in their country, if they were harmed in the Kingdom, it would be disastrous. So the Colonel is a babysitter, restricting their every move.<br /><br />During the course of their visit, the terrorists strike against the FBI team and this sets off a series of action packed events. The team races after the terrorists, chasing them in cars into an unsafe area, filled with people sympathetic to the cause of Abu Hams, the Bin Laden wannabee. Then, when they can drive no further, they chase the terrorists through buildings and continue the search.<br /><br />These scenes are exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The threat level and danger are constant and very raw and don't let up, reminding me of some of Michael Mann's work. Mann is one of the producers on this film and his influence is clear.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is good, but a bit one note. His one motivation is to find out who committed this crime and bring them to justice. After they arrive in Saudi Arabia, he naturally spends a lot of time with Colonel Al Ghazi, and as is dictated by films like this, they come to respect one another, forming a form of friendship, a bond.<br /><br />Early in the film, as Fleury learns of the attack, he is at his son's school answering questions from the Kindergarten class. As he tries to get the right permissions to make the trip, we see a few interactions with his son, who is so darn cute and asks things like "What did the bad men do?" I think these scenes are meant to give Foxx's character more humanity, but they are way too Action Movie 101 to be successful. Every action film ever made has some variation of this type of scene.<br /><br />Fleury's son may also be intended as a counterpoint to a character we meet later, Abu Hamza's granddaughter. But this doesn't exactly work. As the film progresses, the granddaughter actually becomes a reflection of, a counterpoint to, Janet Mayes, Jennifer Garner's character.<br /><br />In fact, each of the characters is a bit one note. Jennifer Garner plays Janet Mayes, an FBI agent who has a personal stake in the attack; one of her mentors was killed. In Saudi Arabia, she looks as determined and grim as Foxx's character. She also must deal with the fact she is a woman, while operating in a country where women have few if any rights.<br /><br />First of all, would anyone actually send Mayes to partake in such an investigation? Her involvement with one of the victims would seem to prejudice her and call her impartiality into question.<br /><br />Chris Cooper is the Agent Who Has Seen It All, the munitions expert who wants, needs to get into a hole and dig around in the mud. He also laughs and shakes his head anytime someone says something that doesn't add up. He has the sort of "Aw shucks" attitude we generally see in Hollywood movie Country Folk. But he is smart as a whistle.<br /><br />Jason Bateman's Adam Leavitt is the most original of the characters. During a briefing, he makes it abundantly clear that an FBI team should be in the Kingdom yesterday, yet when he is on the plane, he is a bit shocked to find himself headed into a dangerous part of the world. He doesn't want to be there and wants to get out of there as soon as possible.<br /><br />Ashraf Barhom plays Colonel Al Ghazi. Initially, his character holds a lot of promise. He watches an interrogation of one of his men, clearly having trouble with the techniques being employed. He allows the interrogation to continue, to a certain point. Later, as he and Fleury start to build a relationship and bond, his character becomes a pretty stereotypical for this sort of film as well. Doesn't every action film have the gruff-by-the-book character that will eventually warm up the main characters and become an ally?<br /><br />As stereotypical and one-note as the characters are, the film still works. It provides an interesting look at the situation in this part of the world, using a single event to provide an entry into the history, politics and people of "The Kingdom". And it has some fantastic action sequences.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>A good procedural. Good action. But sometimes you just want to say, slow down.

Things aren't quite what they seem however, and soon enough Fleury and his crew have five days to figure out just what happened.  As The Kingdom moves along, Fleury and his crew find unlikely allies and traverse the local politics, leading up to an explosive finale.  With everything that The Kingdom does action-wise, it disappoints in it's script.  The entire film sends a mixed message that feels as if it doesn't even know what it's trying to convey to the viewer.  This isn't always noticeable thanks to the great performances from Foxx and co., and director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) manages to wonderfully orchestrate some spectacular, and surprising, action sequences.  All in all, despite the mixed message that The Kingdom delivers, it's worth seeing for the action elements alone, which are enough to make anyone stand up and cheer.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A good but slightly unbelievable film about a small group of FBI lead by Jamie Fox who investigate a terrorist bombing in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which involved the loss of large number of american lives.

They are arrive at the bomb site and piece together that an ambulance had the explosive (Great how does that help find the culprit ?). They find some marbles at the bombsite (fantastic !). And they find a location from which the terrorists filmed the live event (which was sent to the press)(Good work guys !). So they do all this and are about to head back home as their time is up but lucky for them the bad guys decide to kill these guys but in the process, the Jamie Fox team tails out the terrorists, finds their hideout and saves one of their friends just in the nick of time escaping certain beheading . The action is great, the chase scenes are great, the free way crashes are well choreographed, but we've seen this done better in the Bourne Series. The Bourne movies have now kind of numbed me to car chases and explosions. It's all been done. But at the end, the story of Kingdom seems like a child's dream. Things just seem to be happening at the right time and in the right way for the FBI team to kill the terrorist bad guys.

Realizing that the diplomatic channels available to him within the United States are useless, he takes his plea to the Saudi ambassador and manages to get approval for seven days to set boots down inside the Kingdom -- with his elite crack investigate team -- so long as he agrees that he and his partners are only empowered as observers.  Once he's inside the country, he manages to peel back the layers of political obstructionism and make headway into uncovering the mastermind behind the terrorist attack.<br /><br />Chris Cooper plays a CIA explosives expert with a hint of Dr. Watson to Jamie Foxx's 'Sherlock Holmes,' a learned world-weary analyst who merely wants to cut out all of the political B.S. and do his job.  Jennifer Garner -- no beginner to action sequences as can be evidence by any season of JJ Abrams' televised spy drama, ALIAS -- is onboard as another American specialist for the team, ratcheting up the tension in the culture clash between the men in a country where women are not allowed to touch a dead Muslim.  However, Jason Bateman nearly steals the show as a smart-mouthed forensics analyst who can't believe that the Saudis won't offer up more cooperation with the United States government; once he's abducted by the bad-guys, the film offers up a neat shot of adrenaline to the arm as the sometimes allied police officers join forces to get him back before (all too predictably) thrown bound and gagged before a video camera waiting for the ax to fall ... literally as well as figuratively.<br /><br />That said, THE KINGDOM delivers some great thrills but is sadly short on political chills.  Essentially, the film compares nicely a police procedural with a political backdrop -- think of it like "Beverly Hills Cop Goes to Saudi Arabia," only without the obvious humor and predictable comedy antics.  Foxx and friends do their best to stay the course, and, whether intentionally or not, THE KINGDOM excels well based on the merits of the players ... Foxx, Garner, Cooper, and Bateman are, easily, a crack international police investigation unit that would work well in another cinema outing or even a series of books.  Think of 'em like a Tom Clancy team or maybe CSI:DUBAI.  The players manage that bit of rewarding chemistry despite very few shared scenes within the story structure and zip/zero/almost-zilch character development.  Given a more effective story, THE KINGDOM's players might have the inklings of a great action-politcal franchise, but, given the limp box office, methinks that's just optimistic thinking ... far more optimism than the film delivers with it's closing scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/AG6UYD56VHOG1.html">AG6UYD56VHOG1</a><br/><p>Amazon will only post my reviews after I ask them to before typing it.<br />Amazon, are you going to post my review?<br />This is a good HD movie that rocks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Anyone who tells you this is "Syriana for Dummies" is clearly off his rocker. Both may be about BigSeriousThemes set in the middle east, but unlike its erudite counterpart, The Kingdom is two films in one: a straightforward FBI procedural, married to a pulse-pounding action thriller where the bad boys of terrorism are brought to book in a frantic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729997">Mortal Kombat</a> style. The resulting mishmash may feel jarring to the vigilant but there's barely any time to mind it.<br /><br />We set off with a credit roll through Saudi Arabian history, a punchy distillation of a hundred and fifty years. Before we know it, rabid explosions rip and set the chilling tone, never to let up right to the final clip. In fact it's a good 15 minutes before we calm just enough to meet our principal characters. More as thumbnails than elaborate portraits.<br /><br />That's a happy band of FBI with Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman. Heroes, they flout State Department orders and arrive in Saudi Arabia with a derring-do attitude, only to receive a cold welcome from their inexpert and ill-equipped Arabian friends. An altogether too many scenes are spent on personal bugbears, but see, the Americans just know better, even without their fancy forensic techniques.<br /><br />Countering this high nose, as best it can, is a captivating performance from Ashraf Barhoum as the Colonel charged with guarding, controlling and interpreting for these interlopers. Barhoum gradually forges something like a buddy-cop partnership with the main American agent. The film allows him some room, both as an individual and as a representative of his nation and the Arab world, to put across his point of view.<br /><br />Frankly, this tense cultivation of a quick bond between these two exemplars of their respective cultures is the most enjoyable part of the minimal talk in the film. You won't miss the standard-issue camp humor from Hollywood.<br /><br />And then comes the slick showdown. Blood bursting, gut wrenching action. Crowd pleasing, popcorn flinging mayhem. This bit is magnetic. There's a mildly mawkish moment when both sides leave a message about "killing them all", but whatever the critics say about the distraction of the hand-held "Collateral"-style camerawork or the ultimate vacuity of the drama, I thoroughly enjoyed the escapism. I forgot all the weak points and thumped right along.<br /><br />It's not a particularly memorable fare or anything--for meaningful documentation on the subject, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140013305X">The Looming Tower</a>--but it does its job and does it with throbbing conviction. Watch it life-size while it's still in theaters.

More than 100 people die, including some FBI agents.  In the US, Ronald Fleury (Foxx) gets his forensic team ready for an investigation.  They consist of: Janey Mayes (Garner, a pathologist; Adam Leavitt (Bateman), a computer expert; and Grand Sykes (Cooper), an explosives expert.  His team is allowed into Saudi Arabia, but they have to be watched by police-colonel Al-Ghazi (Barhom).  Of course, he is more intent on keeping the peace than getting to the bottom of things, and as Fleury and his team get closer to the answers they are looking for, things begin to spiral out of control.<br /><br />"The Kingdom" is an excellent movie that is both intelligent and suspenseful.  It is well acted all around, and especially by Jason Bateman.  He has the meatiest role, and gives a strong dramatic performance.  He also gets the best one-liners.  The story and direction are top notch.  The movie is tense and urgent, pulling the viewer in with ease.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Many of the reviews I've read of THE KINGDOM comment on how appropriate or not it is to make what is essentially an action-thriller against the setting of modern terrorism.  The hidden implication of these criticisms is that "it's not okay to make a movie showing a horrific act of terrorism, and these acts being avenged, because the current war on terror is so wrong."  Oh, REEEAAAALLLLLYYYYY???<br /><br />If I remember correctly, over the past few decades, there have been groups of Muslim terrorists who kill and maim innocent Americans and other "foreigners" with great glee.  Yet Hollywood has relished depicting our efforts to root out such criminals/terrorists/mass-murderers with disdain.  Now I'm the first to admit that war is an ugly thing, that many mistakes have been made in the latest war and that the goal of "eliminating" terrorism may be a stretch, to say the least.  But I also remember the huge truck bomb in Beirut, the USS Cole, and some attacks on the World Trade Center.  I think it's okay to show that a part of the American experience might include investigating acts of terrorism and then hunting down and destroying the perpetrators.<br /><br />Films like JARHEAD, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH, etc. tell us that we'd all be better off if we just brought the troops home.  Movies like UNITED 93 remind us that we were acted in our own land.  A movie like THE KINGDOM reminds us that terror against Americans can strike anywhere, and it dares to suggest that we can actually fight back.  I had no real problem with its "politics"...aside from a tacked-on and silly ending that implied some moral equivalency between the terrorists and the FBI's efforts to hunt them down.<br /><br />Okay, politics aside now.  How was the movie?  It was pretty darn good.  The acts of terror that start the film are credible and terrifying.  The FBI team that is more or less snuck into Saudi Arabia to investigate are a bit unlikely (of all the people they could have brought, was bring a woman the best choice?)  But our stars (Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) do intense work and take it all very seriously.  They spend a lot of time being frustrated at the red-tape that is constantly in their way.  But what I liked is that the movie showed them gradually winning the trust of a couple of Arab police men...men who are equally outraged at the destruction the terrorists have wrought.  There is nice interplay between the Americans and Saudis...occasionally it is a bit cliched and predictable...but it never teeters into the maudlin or God-forbid "buddy comedy" mode.  Because the action of the movie moves along briskly, there isn't really time for subtle characterization.  Foxx is the tough-talking leader (and the least convincing character, actually), Garner is the woman that all the Arabs are outraged at, Bateman is Jewish and a smart-mouth, so naturally he has some problems fitting in and Chris Cooper is Chris Cooper...which is a good thing...that guy is just so darn interesting to watch all the time.<br /><br />Most of the movie is really just leading us to the final 30 minutes or so, when the little group of investigators falls under attack.  And holy smokes, is that stuff exciting.  It is super tense and hurtles along at breakneck speed.  With the jumpy hand-held camera work, fast editing, terrific sound editing and lots of bullets flying and bodies dropping...it gets your adreneline going.  Everything leading up to this has been entertaining and interesting, but it's the end of the movie where you get a great payoff.<br /><br />Since this is a Hollywood production, the script does occasionally get predictable, and Jamie Farr has some scenes in which he relates with little kids that are really pretty silly.  Not because Farr can't talk to kids, but he just says stuff to them that no one in real life would.  So yes, like almost every movie ever made, we are being manipulated somewhat.  But for the most part, the movie does it successfully.  Does it exploit the war on terror simply to entertain?  There's nothing simple about that question...I WAS entertained...but I was also reminded of the grim fact that we need people fighting the war on terror.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This is an action packed film that lacks any originality and whose sole purpose seems to be to show a)The intolerance of Saudi Muslims b) the ignorance and dysfunctionality of our State Department c) Christians use profanity while Muslims do not d)not all Muslims are hate filled but there are a few who are rational.  The plot was really pretty thin, the characters not well developed,and  the objective of the movie seemed to be to get to the final gun battle.<br /><br />There were a number of logical flaws and the first comes at the beginning of the film where it is daylight in Saudi Arabia and one hour later it is daylight in Washington D.C.  This doesn't detract from the film but it is indicative to the lack of attention to detail that seems to plague this film.  It does manage to show -- without actually stating the point -- that Christians are not allowed in Saudi Arabia and those that are necessary are barely tolerated and certainly restricted. The FBI sends a female agent to Saudi Arabia -- a country where women have no rights, who are not allowed to drive, who are expected to have their heads covered at all times, and a place where the men would not speak to a woman outside of their immediate family.  Yet the FBI sends her and the only purpose seemed to be was to get to the one point where she is denied access because she is a woman but at all other times she is treated like the men. Not logical but there it is! The gun battle is amazing because the number of rounds fired rivaled D Day.  It was like the old westerns where the six guns never ran out of ammo and never had to be reloaded. Of course the good guys have infallible aim while the bad guys -- who outnumber them and are more heavily armed -- can't hit the side of a barn with a cannon -- in this case rocket propelled grenades.  Then this gun battle takes place in a building which appears to be an empty apartment building because all of the rooms are empty except the one where the terrorist family is living.  This is not viewed as suspicious until it is too late.  Of course the "good" Muslim gets killed because this allowed the director and screen play to drive home the multi-cultural rapport between the FBI agent and the Muslim Officer.<br /><br />So this is a heavily flawed film but I give it four stars because it is exciting and the gun battle -- flawed as it is -- will certainly get your adrenalin flowing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"The Kingdom is gripping, intense, and ultimately utterly depressing. That makes sense, since that seems to sum up the current, modern political situation we're mired in. Berg takes us straight into the heart of the Middle East problem and though the good guys may win the smaller battles in his movie the film builds so much complication around them that it's clear there's no real victory here or anywhere. Like all movies about the Middle East, The Kingdom is ultimately hopeless." Josh Tyler<br /><br />Peter Berg has directed a film of the Middle East that resonates with me. The film opens with a violent attack on Americans living and working in Saudi Arabia. It is so graphic and violent that it is understood immediately that we are in a place that will not let-up. Ever vigilant and ever ready we must never let our guard down. After the attack we follow the FBI and a team of 4 agents who go to Saudi Arabia to follow the clues and find the murderers of one hundred innocents and one of their own. Jamie Fox plays Agent Fleury with finesse.  Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman round out the team.<br /><br />The essence of the film surrounds the friendship that Agent Fleury and Col. Al-Ghazi, played by Ashraf Barhom, develop. Men from two cultures but with one goal in mind-the murderers, find and destroy them. This is a lasting friendship and Ashraf Barhom steals this film. If the goal of this film was to identify with the Saudis the goal has been met.  The hunt becomes so reality based and intense, that I was on the edge of my seat with my hands over my eyes for many scenes. I was holding my breath as I realized that I felt as if I had been there and that this is the daily life of the peoples in the Middle East.<br /><br />The film's theme that there is more that unites us with the Middle East culture than divides us hits home time and time again and the final scene resonates with those thoughts.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 01-27-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNEW">Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006OD44E">Ray</a></p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>The frenetic pace of this movie was a little too fast for me.

So much so fast that you could barely get the story put together.<br /><br />I'd skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Visceral as it may be, Peter Berg's "The Kingdom" employs an absurd premise: That a terrorist attack on American oil workers in Saudi Arabia would allow for a character-driven, small-ensemble hunt for the ringleader to ensue in the midst of crowded markets and impromptu prayer sessions.<br /><br />Hogwash; such a thing would trigger a Saudi lock down so swift and fierce that said investigation would play out amidst deserted streets and silence. The remaining American workers and their families would be whisked "out country" in hours.<br /><br />A grieving Tim McGraw, stumbling around in a base house near the bomb site two days after the deed? Please.<br /><br />It'd be easier to suspend belief if Berg and screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan weren't so intent on imposing the facts of the US-Saudi relationship - true, but obvious and meant to impress - in the movie's opening credits. Or using title placards to identify characters, documentary-style. Or fixating on the supposed efficiency and forensic genius of an elite four-person FBI team, led by Jamie Foxx, who basically wears shades, growls and  plays cool until the half-hour gun battle right out of Michael Mann's playbook. A grainy film stock can't obscure a rudderless police procedural in which the bad guys finally intervene on behalf of the good ones so the movie can end in a rush of blood.<br /><br />Foxx is Ronald Fleury, an FBI investigator whose team of snoops includes grizzled Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), a token, braver-than-thou female in Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner) and, yeah, comic relief in Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). Levity? Get it? Nebbish whining from a geek in the wake of a terrorist attack?  Tastes like dry Strawberry Quik, especially when the geek becomes distressed damsel, and is saved twice from a beheading. Once by a faulty camera tripod.<br /><br />You cannot imagine a more unlikely foursome. Fortunately, Carnahan's script provides a Saudi cop (Ashraf Barhom from "Paradise Now") whose "rules" forbid the FBI from doing much. "The Kingdom" has an interminable second act in which Fleury's gang seeks the identity of someone the audience has already met, through means that will not get them particularly close. Indeed, the team seems to fall short, until a bit of serendipitous violence - it can't be called anything else - drags our intrepids straight to the rocket-infested lair.<br /><br />What's left? A meandering travelogue? "The Kingdom" knows some things about Saudi Arabia, and even has the sense to compare and contrast cultures, but it underlines these critiques in a preening, know-it-all way that Berg brings to his work. Berg's camera flits about the chaos before zeroing in, over and over, for that just-so line of poignancy - only he does it with varying shot widths, which, in its own way, is just as ridiculous as all those slap-dash, get-a-car-crash-from-12 angles films in the 1980s. Berg's mentor, Mann, falls into that trap occasionally - see "Ali" - but not like this.<br /><br />And the less said about the coda of "The Kingdom," the better. Enough to say that it's as self-conscious and a little bit sickening. Check out Berg's barely perceptible zoom on the movie's final image. Arrogant much?</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>THE KINGDOM (2007) Directed by Peter Berg. Score by Danny Elfman.<br /><br /> Starring Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman as the whiny cowardly Jew.<br /><br /> After an Al Quaeda attack on the American section in Saudi Arabia leaves over a hundred dead, a team of FBI agents manage to gain entrance to the Kingdom for five days to try and solve the case in spite of general Islamic obstruction and intolerance. Though aided by a sympathetic Saudi Police officer, they do not actually solve the case but rather the case resolves itself when the terrorists attack again allowing the agents to shoot them all dead in as confusing gunfight.<br /><br /> While not the typical anti-American/proterrrorist liberal propaganda fare coming from Tehran West, the film shows that even when they try and not do the above, Hollywood simply has no idea how since its morals and knowledge of the subject is so puerile and deranged that it is simply beyond them. The film does have Muslim Terrorists murdering innocent people but it is far more concerned with showing the single muppet like Muslim police officer be all cute and cuddly as he tells us how he grew up watching Bill Bixby in The Incredible Hulk. The film's dialogue and tone is atrocious adapting a sort of hip Not Ready for Saturday Night Live characterizations for the four FBI agents completely trivializing the recent mass murder of their fellow citizens. The dialogue such as it is consists of people talking unintelligibly over one another, cursing and making empty catch phrases. Easily 90 percent of the dialogue could be cut with no loss to the plot. There is no reason for Jennifer Garner to be in the picture. Her part could have been played by anyone. Her part could have been cut. The usually good Cooper is awful. Because the film does show some Muslim's behaving badly, to provide "balance", we get subjected to Bateman's APPALLING and increasingly regular Hollywood stock figure of the whiny cowardly Jew thus indicating that the West Coast seems to think that there is money to be made in anti-Semitism.<br /><br /> The film is so concerned with being innocuous and non-threatening(except for the Jews) that about 30 minutes in it begins to distance itself further and further from the film's basic plot--to wit Muslim barbarians killing people and the race to stop them. The film seems to want to be anywhere else than where it should be. Thus we get pointless scenes of Bush Administration officials----though portrayed acting like Clinton Administration officials. We get endless scenes of the cute FBI agents engaging in mindless banter. They never actually solve the case and instead we get shots designed to show us that Muslims love their children too. Which is not the problem. Rather it is that they hate everyone else's children and want to kill them. The film never even attempts to address what should be the film's main issue. Just why are these Muslims racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic mass murdering barbarians and what should we do about it??<br /><br /> The film does not know and does not want to know. It's message seems to be that Americans should just stay home and never leave the country.<br /><br /> AND in the last scene, presumably to assure good reviews, the film compares Al Queada with the FBI indicating that they are morally equivalent. And as was once noted in regards to the Cold War. Those who claim moral equivalence between the forces of freedom and good and the forces of oppression and barbarism actually mean nothing of the kind and are on the side of the later.<br /><br /> The film is badly directed with action scenes so incomprehensible that the DVD comes with a feature allowing the viewer to figure out what was going on.<br /><br /> In spite of the repugnant final scene, the film is not terrible but it is not especially good. If one cannot tell the difference between good and evil then one cannot make a film about the difference between good and evil............and if one tends to be sympathetic to the later........................<br /><br /> Boring more than anything else.<br /><br /> A wasted opportunity...probably by design.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Good direction by Peter Berg (who also makes a guest appearance). Even though the content is emotionally charged this is a character driven movie. With the leads of two different sides conflicting but coming together to work on the same goal--Finding the evil doers. Special Kudos to Ashraf Barhom (Colonel Ghazi and Jason Bateman (Adam Leavitt). From the beginning you become attached to the scene and what is going on. The special effects are well done and a painful tension is maintained throughout the whole film. Not everyone makes it out alive and the losses are unexpected. I highly recommend this film which in the end delivers a never ending message.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The movie is tense from the beginning till the end. It's also bloody. There are only 3 actions scenes but they're very realistic because of 2 things listed below<br /><br />1. Whoever was shot died instantly because he was shot multiple times.<br /><br />2. After a person was shot and dead, the camera focused on him for a very short time then it moved to another person/area. In reality, this is what a soldier does. If he spends too much time to focus on the person he just shot he might be shot by the enemy! However, this makes it's hard for the viewer to clearly see how a person died. I had to watch the movie 2 times before I could see all the details of the fighting scenes. For some people, this might be a turn-off.<br /><br />To me, it's still one of the 3 best thrillers/action movies of 2007. The other two are Transformers and AVPR (Alien versus Predator Requiem)</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>On the cover of THE KINGDOM DVD, it reads: "A riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb of a movie." some dude from maxim magazine.<br /><br />I believe that he was the guy that they put up in the luxury hotel and gave him a few square meals when he came to see the film.<br /><br />THE KINGDOM is not a bad movie, but to say it's a riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb is a tremendous exageration. Yes, like a time bomb... nothing happens until the last thirty minutes when it finally erupts, but that is where all the plot holes and problems with the film subside. The ticking time bomb... proves to be a dud.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed THE KINGDOM, to an extent, but it just falls right into a long list of movies that I've seen in the past few years that I've already forgotten. Once I'm done writing this review, THE KINGDOM will most likely never be talked about by me or many others.<br /><br />The story revolves around a terrorist act against infadels in Saudi Arabia. A softball game on a military base. FBI agents are brought into the foreign country to help find the culprits. Yet, they are restrained and watched and trapped in a building at night, not allowed to gather evidence and not allowed to interview anyone without a Saudi witness hovering over their shoulder.<br /><br />All of this, I found tremendously realistic and unsettling. This was some of the stuff that THE KINGDOM did right. You can feel the resentment of the Saudi's for us being there. They are more concerned and untrusting of us being there, then the deed inflicted by one of their own.<br /><br />Yet, when the movie unfolds and they start actually making headway, zeroing in on the illusive terrorist that nobody can identify, everything goes predictably wrong. A reference to a man's severed and mangled hands being the hands of a bomb maker. A pointless attack on the FBI convoy as they are LEAVING THE COUNTRY which ends up being the ONLY REASON why they track the CULPRITS back to their hideout. A series of terrorist cliche's that seem to role out like a collection of headlines over the last 4 years. Hidden behind children and women. Videotaping an intended beheading. Terrorists firing RPGs willy nilly. An American giving a saudi child a sucker in the midst of a battle. All of which are true, but crammed into a twenty minute time period, seemed unrealistic, cliche' and predictable.<br /><br />It's an okay movie, just forgettable... what movie were we talking about again?</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>I'm really not sure how I feel--or rather, how I should feel--about Peter Berg's "The Kingdom." It opens with a softball game in Saudi Arabia and ends with the assertion that war, hatred, and intolerance are much more complex than most would like to believe. Not only does this seem manipulative, it also seems like a message we've been given before. But when you stop and think about it, there are hardly any original messages left in war movies. They usually achieve one of two things: they either instill compassion by showing a clear divide between allies and enemies, or they prominently feature battle, blood, and death to drive home the point that enemies are more alike than different. I honestly don't know which category "The Kingdom" falls under; there were moments when I thought I knew, but as the scenes progressed, my mind kept changing. By the end, I was more confused than anything else.<br /><br />The opening softball game takes place in a Saudi Arabian military compound, in which American soldiers are stationed along with their families. As the game continues, the compound is attack by Islamic extremists--dozens are gunned down, and dozens more fall victim to suicide bombers. In response, a special FBI task force is sent in with specific instructions to find the mastermind behind the attack and put him to justice. The Special Agents consist of: Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx), Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). Every one of these characters is broadly developed, suggesting a misguided belief in clich&eacute;s. Both Fleury and Mayes are gung ho and mad as hell because one of their colleagues was lost in the attack. Sykes' Southern drawl is second only to his ability to dig through mud. Leavitt is the timid, wisecracking one, serving no real purpose other than to be annoying.<br /><br />They team up with Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), an officer of Saudi Arabia's military. As might be expected, there is some serious culture clash at play, especially since Al Ghazi doesn't speak fluent English. As might also be expected, Fleury and Al Ghazi become friends; I understand that such a thing is possible in real life, but I have a hard time believing that the makers of "The Kingdom" weren't relying on a convenient plot device. In a film like this, nothing much is gained from an international friendship. It exists only for cathartic reasons, giving the audience something to feel good about in the midst of a bad situation. In this case, a war between democracy and fundamentalism is being fought--this is obviously a lot to feel bad about.<br /><br />But the relationship between Fleury and Al Ghazi unfairly plays against the negativity. There's no depth or meaning to their friendship; it's nothing but an excuse to be poignant and sentimental. To elaborate on this would give too much away, so let's just say that the ending reiterates the message that tolerance is a distant goal. This message has been firmly established in the minds of the movie going public, so firmly, in fact, that it's practically become a convention of war movies. And when such a message is paired with needlessly sappy imagery, I can't help but feel conned. Example: Mayes, a lollipop junky, offers one of her lollipops to a Saudi Arabian girl no more than seven years old. Something so melodramatic doesn't belong in a film like this.<br /><br />Still, it would be too harsh to say that this film is a complete failure. Indeed, it has moments of effectiveness, such as inter cut shots of terrorists constructing homemade bombs. To watch this footage is to be reminded that such people actually exist, which helps to firmly ground the audience in reality. One can't help but wonder the thoughts going through their heads: Despite what they're brainwashed to believe, are they really ready to take their own lives? After all, they're human beings above all else--the terrorist ideology comes later.<br /><br />If only "The Kingdom" could fully support such thought provoking material. This film tries so hard to be humanistic that it only becomes fatalistic, and this is bad because I knew that its heart was in the right place. Peter Berg shows promise as a filmmaker, especially since his projects are very character-oriented ("Friday Night Lights," for example). But something was missing from "The Kingdom," something that prevented it from being a compelling drama. Even Jeremy Piven as an American ambassador to Saudi Arabia doesn't help things much, especially since his character is so briefly featured. I think what's missing is the willingness to be daring; a shootout occurs near the end of the film, and despite being violent, graphic, and difficult to watch, it felt restrained and incomplete. If a movie like this wants to send a clear, important message to its audience, then I'm afraid restraint is not going to work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>By the time I was coming to terms with the politics of "The Kingdom," director Peter Berg launches into one of the biggest and best action sequences of 2007, which becomes the primary reason to see the film.  A quick primer in the history of Saudi Arabia in the past century is provided during the opening credits before shifting to a community of foreign oil workers and their families living in Riyadh that is hit by a two-fold terrorist attack.  FBI agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) wants to get his forensic team on site to investigate, but the Saudis insist on handling things themselves.  That situation changes (otherwise this is a totally different movie), and he heads there with pathologist Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), explosives expert Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), and computer geek Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman).  But once in Riyadh they find themselves being babysat by Colonel Al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), whose primary goal is not to actually assist the Americans in their investigation but rather to make sure they are not killed during the five days they are allowed to be in the Kingdom.  At least that is the line Al-Ghazi is spouting at the start of the film..<br /><br />The hook for this movie is pretty good, with the terrorist attack and the need for vengeance.  But then most of this movie is about investigating the bombing, although to be more specific it would be trying to investigate the bombing since the FBI agents are put under such strictures by the Saudi police that they might as well go back home and check things out using a spy satellite.  However, the last act of "The Kingdom" is what justifies this movie, because there is a another terrorist attack and the quartet of Americans are right in the middle of it.  As a director Berg uses the documentary style that worked so well in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNEW">Friday Night Lights</a>," although for most of the film it seems an unnecessary approach.  Then we get to the big action sequences and discover Berg is totally in his element at this point.  The cast is certainly a unique combination of talent, and the strangest part is not Jason Bateman playing it straight, but watching Jennifer Garner fight and having to remind yourself that she is not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5V8DG">Sidney Bristow</a> (or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P0Y7C">Elektra</a>) and to stop expecting her to dispatch people with dispatch.<br /><br />Saudi Arabia is one of America's strongest allies in the Middle East, but this film makes it clear that if the country was not parked over all that oil we would want nothing to do with them.  The overly didactic ending echoes the infamous declaration associated with the "Pogo" comic strip, "We have met the enemy and they is us," but I suspect the point is more about the ultimate limits of taking an eye for an eye.  Clearly there is some warning implicit in the resolution of this film, but how that translates into foreign policy or political support for any particular candidate is too difficult a job of connecting the dots to figure out.  Part of me is interested in seeing a movie like that which is just about trying to investigate a crime in a strange land under such strange circumstances, but I suspect it would be hard to come up with a better ending than the pedal to the metal action sequence that brings the extant version home.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie was good and the story was nice.

With him comes his three person team, agents Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZIGDU">Jarhead</a>), Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66Q7O">Smokin' Aces</a>) and the lovely/deadly Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner).<br /><br />But once on Saudi sand the team quickly learns that they're being shuttered and kept uber-safe by a team of special police headed by Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0OE44">Paradise Now</a>).<br /><br />Angered for being unable to get into the bomb site, the team eventually gets Colonel Ghazi to take them into his confidence. Discoveries are made. Material is excavated. But on the other side danger lurks for Fleury and his team. Bombers are aware of the FBI's arrival and want a high profile target. The agents are targeted and when an explosion rocks through their security and one of Fleury's team members is dragged away (obviously to be executed on tape later), Ghazi and Fleury join forces and form a bond neither thought possible (one between devout Muslim and a Christian).<br /><br />Loaded with action but little plot, the main sequences occur after the kidnapping of the FBI agent. A series of chase scenes and gun battles culminate to form the final sections of the movie. Heading deep into jihadist territory, the audience is treated to some incredible shots where lives are won and lost on both sides. The ending commentary by Fleury (Foxx) and a Muslim child left behind is very telling as to what keeps conflict going from generation to generation.<br /><br />Not being a huge fan of the action-over-plot films, I found myself making an exception here for two reasons. First were the action scenes intense enough to keep my hands clenched for many minutes. I hadn't realized how tense I was until my hands started aching. Second is how relevant this subject is to our current situation in the Persian Gulf. What exactly is the U.S. plan for the Middle East (plot)?<br /><br />Needless to say, if you enjoy stories that have an actual point, you might not care for The Kingdom. But if you're one of those newfound movie lovers of style over substance, you'll enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>This movie had a plot that was pretty boring if I can be honest.  I wasn't really interested in the fast pace or the "hurry up and force the viewers into the storyline while all kinds of confusing violence and people screaming goes on in the background" way of writing.  The actors and actresses played their parts really good, but it can't save a storyline that isn't interesting.  Plus, as another reviews mentions, it's just typical war prapaganda.  How many times are we going to see movies like this?  I've had enough of them.  All the subtitles you have to read are more trouble than they're worth.  Enough is enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>There should be no convincing a true cinephile into dodging any film but for ethical or religous reasons. But on the other hand, really, sometimes you still gotta try as a humanitarian and human being to try and convince innocent people. If you want to miss that hurting feeling I get (like a fastball in the dirt that ricochets up into the nards) you get from a lasceratingly bad ending, please hear it here or from anyone else with sense enough to write about it. It is so shoddy that you get vomity with it. I want to say that down to its purest form cinema is the feeling you take with you and that usually, USUALLY, lies in the impact of the climax or that area near the end. Sometimes upset people want to put there own two cents into the ending, or, more tactfully, some seasame street like message of the day at the end that makes adults feel like go-retards. I'm like eighty percent of our country in that I'm A) not suffering from infatilism, and B)well,...I'm not a kid anymore. So please dont sugar coat, don't rape the action scenes and charaterization that sent us through rings of JOY before! Notice, and I know you have, how I gave this film THREE stars. This isn't an exact science, but something in me, maybe that part of the brain that belongs way back to the caveman days when we NEEDED to be excited with things like 'fire' and 'cool shaped rocks' cause there wasn't t.v., well something in me from that part remembered the 'excitement' of the kingdom earlier in it. I don't enjoying axing a film apart, but I'm being forced into it this time by basically wasting something like an hour and some heavy change.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>Saudi Arabia looks like a cross between Vegas and Iraq in this incredibly illogical, boring film signed Peter Berg. Jamie Foxx does his best to look like Denzel Washington, and even succeeds to a large extent, but not even he can save this production. The only action scenes are in the beginning and at the end ("Abu Hamza, I presume?"), and the ending feels strangely lachrymose. Frankly, this is so bad that it only deserves one star, but since I don't like Wahhabis, I suppose I have to give it two. And now, a weather forecast!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>As we stand in a war that has already lasted longer than all of World War II and Hollywood's method for handling the material is to shoot for the jugular, then crack a one-liner. Audiences can't seem to handle anything remotely serious without shenanigans on the side, but fortunately The Kingdom is so well-made, engaging (even if the screenplay talks smarter than it is), and, at times, heart-stopping that it's impossible to look away As the film opens, terrorists (dressed as Saudi police officers) launch a suicide attack on a softball game involving mostly Americans living inside a Western compound within the capital city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While the suits debate their next move, FBI agent Ronald Fleury (Foxx) negotiates a five-day trip to Saudi Arabia to investigate the crime firsthand. Joining him are three others; the bomb expert (Cooper), the forensics guru (Garner), and the guy whose sole purpose is drop annoying one-liners (Bateman). Once the crew arrives they befriend Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Barhom), a man who knows the inner workings of the terror cells in the area. As the investigation deepens the team finds themselves at odds with who to trust - and who might be the terror mastermind.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg has a keen eye behind the camera and his pacing is what drives the film. While it's more of a procedural than a straight-up action film, once things start getting really ramped up in final forty-five minutes you'll be hard-pressed to catch your breath. That's when it truly becomes apparent that The Kingdom is more about action than actual substance, which is what an astute viewer will pick up on early. I don't have a problem with that as the film is always fascinating, but it's impossible to dismiss the fact that had the screenplay, by Matthew Michael Carnahan, really taken it up a notch in terms of social relevance, this could have been so much more.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is smooth as the leader of the team and Jason Bateman provides a sly comment or two. Jennifer Garner goes into action like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5V8DG">Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A9QK96">Elektra - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and certainly shows what she is made of in fight scenes. It's good to see her on the screen again. Ali Suliman as the Saudi police officer and Ashraf Barhom as the Saudi Colonel are names not familiar to American audiences. They portray their roles well, especially Barhom. You see the mind set of both sides in The Kingdom, from the Americans presence and aid to the groups of terrorists in the Middle East who don't want Americans there at all.  The terrorists seem to think, "Death to everyone but you and me and sometimes I wonder about you." Not everyone in the Middle East is against Americans and we also see that terrorists target anyone---Americans or Saudi in this film---who go against what they want. Nothing new there, this type of mind set has been going on around the world for thousands of years.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This movie starts out with an attack by al-Qaida terrorists on a living<br />area(compound) for American oil company employees in Saudi Arabia. This occurs during a softball game between the employees. The terrorists are<br />wearing Saudi police uniforms so they have access to the compound. They<br />open fire on unsuspecting residents. Innocent victims are mowed down in mass. To top it off a bomb detonates in the compound. This results in 100<br />American casualties. Over the opposition of the State Department the FBI<br />places a four man investigative team in Saudi Arabia. This team is led by<br />Ronald Fleury(ably played by Jamie Foxx). His is assisted by a ranking Saudi police officer. At first the Saudis refuse to cooperate. Finally when cooperation comes forth they start making headway in the case. Fleury<br />develops a friendship with the Saudi police officer. They also discover that they have terrorist sympathizers in their ranks. There is gunfire and action aplenty in this movie. It also has an ending that will make an impression.

As luck would have it, instead of water they found oil, and lots of it, and so began the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco.)  This discovery and the resulting agreements for profit sharing gave the Saudi monarchy the wherewithal to purchase yachts with gold toilets and other such necessities, but also brought about the hatred of certain fundamentalists.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Terrorists attack the residential compound of an American oil company, killing many innocent people<br />2. FBI team of Jamie Foxx (team leader), Jennifer Garner (forensics), Chris Cooper (demolitions) and Jason Bateman (intel analyst) have five days to find out whodunit<br />3. Middle of movie takes a while to get around to the point, establish relationships, sort through debris, find clues and create a speaking role for Jeremy Piven.<br />4. Ending rocks<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />1. Somewhat political, but not overly so<br />2. Somewhat religious, but not overly so<br />3. Extremely moving at times, with characters from both sides freely showing their emotions<br />4. Well acted in most cases<br />5. Great beginning and end, but a little too much left in the middle<br />6. Recommended for those who like well-acted action movies with a political/religious slant and not much of a plot<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 19, 2007</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>I wish I could tell you the last words of "The Kingdom" before I wrote another word. Those last words tell a different story. But I am not allowed.<br /><br />The opening credits are displayed against black and white clips, while a voice-over narrative describes the growing relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia before and after oil was discovered, a relationship going back to early last century. When the compound for American families of American oil business in Saudi Arabia is bombed and over 100 killed, a hand-picked crew of four FBI agents goes to investigate.<br /><br />As often happens when reasonable people of unfriendly sides work together, friendships are forged, grudgingly then respectfully. That these bonds are set is a testament that men are men, not their trappings, not their national identity, not their religious beliefs, but their common respect for recognized brotherhood.<br /><br />And what is this kingdom? Saudi Arabia? Islam? Oil power?  Brotherhood? Perhaps. I fully expected an action movie and that's what is delivered, but that is not the point. The searching for clues for the mastermind of the bombing, the interviewing, the struggle for more reach are just vehicles for a common bond. Two men, one American, one Saudi, both government officials, begin working together, not against each other to find evidence.<br /><br />From this point on, whatever the viewer expects to happen doesn't. There is a frenzy of fighting in the zealots' own home turf, with apparently every apartment dweller privy to uzis (or their update) and those guns that launch little flying torpedoes. However, with the team of four Americans and two Saudis working together, the master bomb maker is discovered. But there are consequences.<br /><br />It is not the conquest that the director goes for. It is the story itself, the characters, their relationship. In fact, it is amazing and productive that an action movie filled with violence can trumpet the glories that lie in men's hearts. "The Kingdom" is all that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>There are very few actors who make a movie a must see for me.  Jennifer Garner is one of them, so I added this movie to my must see list.  Unfortunately, she wasn't enough to save this movie.<br /><br />When a terrorist attack takes place in a heavily guarded American compound in Saudi Arabia, Americans are incensed.  This is especially true for FBI agent Ronald Fluery (Jamie Foxx).  He wants nothing more then to fly over there and personally track down the men responsible.<br /><br />Since Americans were involved, the FBI is the logical choice to lead the investigation even though it is on foreign soil.  Unfortunately, the Saudis aren't interested in American help.  Their government doesn't want to look weak in front of their people, so they refuse.  At first.  But a few well placed connections get Fluery and a team of crime scene investigators sent over there for five days.  The team consists of agents Janet Mayers (Jennifer Garner), Adam Leavitt (Justin Bateman), and Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper).<br /><br />Upon landing, the team soon discovers that getting there was only half the battle.  The Saudis aren't willing to let them conduct any kind of investigation.  And the American consulate is more concern for the agents' safety then helping them accomplish their mission.  Will they be able to cut through the red tape?  Can they find the mastermind in just 5 days?<br /><br />I will admit I was a little wary of seeing this movie because of the subject matter.  I wasn't sure if this would be a political hit piece or not.  Fortunately, I found it to be evenhanded and the last couple of minutes will definitely start a few conversations, which is always a good thing.<br /><br />The acting was great, both from the well known American stars and the unknown Saudi actors.<br /><br />That's where the good parts end, however.<br /><br />I had some major issues with the stylistic approach the director made.  I get that handheld cameras are more "realistic" and are supposed to make us feel like we are really watching something.  All it does for me is annoy me and turn me off to a film.<br /><br />Additionally, there are multiple quick cuts, sometimes showing us a character for just a few seconds.  Between these two problems, I found it way too difficult to follow the movie and I even felt sick a few times.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie also has problems on the storytelling level.  Except for one of the Saudi characters, everyone else just felt like cardboard characters just doing their parts.  Granted, that might be because I had such a hard time following everything, but it was disappointing.<br /><br />Not that the plot was really that great.  I thought the idea of a CSI meets thriller had promise.  However, plot points and characters seemed to disappear at random, which left me scratching my head.  And the movie is rather slow for a thriller.  The first part is slow as the team cuts through red tape in Washington and Saudi Arabia.  The action picks up in the last half hour.  However, I was so detached by this point, it really didn't grab me like it wanted to.<br /><br />The movie was great for my Jennifer Garner fix.  Other then take, it was a real disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>My God, what a horrible mess of a movie. Was there a single character here that one could feel for? Nope. Not only that, the constant jerking around of the camera gives you motion sickness. (That's defintely one modern fimmaking technique I can do without; reminds me of how an amateur would handle a camera rather than imparting some sort of gritty, "real" feel). Then there's the half-baked story. A total insult to your intelligence. In summary: No characters worth mentioning, idiotic story and overuse of film "technique" to try to make up for it. The movie fails on all counts. Bad, bad, bad!</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>From its opening scenes, depicting the Kingdom of Saud and its turbulent modern history following the discovery of oil in its barren deserts, THE KINGDOM sets the table for a white-knuckling political/cultural thriller.  And director Peter Berg (so outstanding with 'Friday Night Lights') delivers a keeper, as an elite FBI team of investigators travels into the American compound in Riyadh to investigate the recent slaughter of numerous U.S. citizens--ostensibly perped by terrorists.  Berg successfully sets the pace, tone, and tension between the FBI team and their Saudi hosts, then moves the viewer full tilt into a hair-raising climactic action sequence that never takes its foot off the gas.<br /><br />The cast is topnotch, headlined by Jamie Foxx as the FBI field commander.  Foxx is tough, no-nonsense, machismo, yet periodically lets down his guard to show a rippling of emotion and compassion.  Jennifer Garner plays the investigative team's forensics expert (and plays it convincingly), while FBI specialists Chris Cooper and Justin Bateman get to share the film's best lines.  Country crooner Tim McGraw is impressive in an extremely emotional cameo role, yet this cast is most enhanced by the performance of Ashraf Barhom.  Playing a Colonel in the Saudi national police--a Colonel in charge of the team's security--Barhom represents the contrast between his Arab culture and the West.  The tension is established from the onset, yet the story delves deep enough into Barhom's character to reveal a humane man with only the best, most honorable intentions.<br /><br />This is a brutal, violent film--a film with an ending that will definitely raise eyebrows.  Yet when it comes to heart-pounding action, intrigue, and suspense--with a story that sprints to the finish line--THE KINGDOM is a thriller as good as it gets.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Jamie Foxx has moved into the A-list at Hollywood.  He's able to deliver drama (RAY, JARHEAD), comedy (THE JAMIE FOXX SHOW), and action (MIAMI VICE).  His role as FBI Special Agent Ronal Fleury in THE KINGDOM is going to further his drama and action acumen.<br /><br />As Fleury, Foxx gets to descend into Saudi Arabian holdings like the unholy wrath of God - eventually.  There's a lot of red tape stringing him up at first.  But by the time he gets through it, he breaks out the big guns and the action couldn't be finer.  It could, however, be more believable at times.  But that's not what this film is about, nor should it be.  This is a high-octane thriller that's wired for violence and explosions.  That's why I bought the DVD and watched it, and I got what I paid for.<br /><br />The movie opens up with an attack against US citizens in a restricted area in Saudi Arabia.  The events are carefully controlled and calculated to do the most harm.  Then the cameramen go to work and roll out some of the most intense chase scenes and gunplay I've seen in a while.  Maybe I'd just been away from that kind of all-out action for too long, but it really hit the spot.<br /><br />The intercut between the devastation and Foxx's character delivering a speech in front of his young son's elementary school class is stark and carries a lot of emotional resonance.  Fleury's friend is giving his life protecting the very thing that Fleury is at the moment enjoying.<br /><br />Afterwards, Fleury asks for permission to put an FBI investigation team on the ground in Saudi Arabia but gets politely refused at every turn.  He resorts to political brinksmanship and blackmail to get an audience with an influential Saudi Arabian who can make everything happen.  Then Fleury piles on even more blackmail.<br /><br />All goes as I knew it would, and Fleury and his team fly to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  The eventual team-up of the American cop and the Saudi Arabian cop isn't a big surprise, but the friendship is built slowly and steadily, and I enjoyed watching it develop.  Ashraf Barhom is absolutely fantastic as the Saudi Arabian officer, Faris al-Ghazi.<br /><br />The cat-and-mouse game that exists between the FBI team and the terrorists, and the FBI team and the Saudi Arabian military is played for all its worth.  Fleury's eventual winning over of the Saudi Arabian prince in charge of the investigation comes surprisingly quickly, but happens in a manner that was totally understandable.<br /><br />Once the FBI team is unleashed, things really start to happen.  I enjoyed the CSI moments of Chris Cooper's Special Agent Grant Sykes displaying his demolitions knowledge when he unearths the actual vehicle that blew up in the protected compound.  And I liked the way that Fleury worked to constantly include al-Ghazi in every discovery the team made at the proper time, while giving the Saudi Arabian officer credit for the discovery as well.<br /><br />The kidnapping of one of the FBI team members initiates the final action sequence of the film.  Those scenes are incredibly tense, and Director Peter Berg makes the most of them.  I felt like I was about to have an adrenaline meltdown waiting to see how the rescue attempt played out.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner got a lot of attention initially in the movie for being a female in the Muslim culture.  However, except for a few scenes, that never really went anywhere.  Her character wasn't really needed, and I didn't know why someone as politically savvy as Fleury was would shoot himself in the foot like that.  But I also know that Hollywood likes to put women in films, so that was a given.<br /><br />I expected Garner to break out some serious ALIAS or ELEKTRA moves at the end of the movie during the rescue attempt, but I was somewhat disappointed.  I also realized that not being a martial arts star was true to her character, though.  By that time, however, I was teetering on the edge of overwhelming anxiety about the fate of Jason Bateman's character, and I figured the team needed every edge they could get.<br /><br />The political message at the end of the film kind of spoiled things for me.  In the end, nothing had been changed.  The body count in the struggle had gone up, but neither side is going to give up.  In fact, both sides have the same ideology, and that message ended up being something of a downer.<br /><br />Overall, THE KINGDOM is a good thriller with plenty of action and tension.  I enjoyed it for the most part, liked the dialogue and the character building between Foxx and Barhom, and agonized - as I was supposed to - during the bullet-riddled climax.  Jamie Foxx is still on the move as a leading man and shows no signs of slowing down.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Despite the purposefully ambiguous "kill them all" message inserted into the script (more on that later), The Kingdom comes across as a very realistic action movie with delicate political and religious overtones.  Without extreme jingoism or political preaching, a picture of the Saudi Arabian kingdom - a possible metaphor for the Iraq war or Islam - is painted in which a culture clash between American FBI agents and oppositional Saudi officials is juxtaposed so that a common bond can be emotionally unearthed beneath the bloody rubble of a terrorist attack.<br /><br />In a post-9/11 environment - a world that has since discovered the majority of the hijackers' were Saudi - the once strong bond between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has weakened under tension.  After a brutal terrorist attack on ARAMCO civilians playing softball, several FBI agents - Ronald Fleurry (Foxx), Grant Sykes (Cooper), Janet Mayes (Garner), Adam Leavitt (Bateman) - are sent to the Middle East to cooperate with initially resistant local officials and find the responsible party in a small five-day window.  While clue hunting, respect between the various investigators is forged, as societal differences are overcome and eventually eschewed because of common bonds, similar foes, and shared emotions - particularly between FBI team lead Fleurry and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Barhom).<br /><br />From top to bottom this movie exudes realism.  The location is authentic; the debris smolders; the locals look confused, terrified, and angry.  The direction is crisp, keeping the viewer on the edge of the seat as soon as it is revealed the hunt is on for a terrorist explosives expert.  Action for the entire second half of the movie.  And the ending?  Woo, the ending is crazy.  A frenzy of gun-play with automatic fire ringing ears, the wet thwop of bodies receiving lead injections, and speaker-rumbling bass accompanying every bomb or RPG.<br /><br />The script by Matthew Michael Carnahan is borderline genius.  How representatives of two foreign governments can come together so quickly, to bond so thoroughly, to display such shared emotion, all while suffering through nearly unspeakable blood and violence, and not feel forced or rushed, is incredibly complimentary for the script and actors who made the situations and relationships so believable.  While somewhat unbelievable at times, its flawless execution makes otherwise noticeable gaffs (Jennifer Garner's outfits in Saudi Arabia would have been frowned upon) disappear.<br /><br />-----SPOILER (kinda)-----<br />I believe the phrase "Kill them all" spoken by the terrorist at the end is what he sees as proactive guidance in reference to his enemies, to kill them simply for who they are.  Conversely, I believe the phrase, when spoken by Jamie Foxx's character, is meant as a vow of revenge in the name of justice, to kill those who have already committed murders and atrocities.  In my view, the two are unequal, and serve as the primary reason for the tensions and dangers that currently exist.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>The Kingdom  DVD<br /><br />The Kingdom starring Jamie Fox and Jennifer Gardner  is about how the FBI  might respond to a bombing in Saudi Arabia which kills American citizens.  Jennifer really kicks some [...].<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Jamie Fox, Jennifer Gardner or people who just want to see America win one.<br /><br />Gunner  December, 2007</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Like The Hurt Locker, The Kingdom is about Americans in a foreign land, this time Saudi Arabia. After an innovative sequence retelling the tale of America's complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia, we witness an escalating series of suicide bomber attacks against an American oil company's housing compound.  The Kingdom never lets us forget that children's lives are at stake here, both American and Saudi, and that war exacts a terrible human cost.<br /><br />Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) leads the charge to track down the terrorists responsible for the bombing.  He brings forensic examiner Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), intelligence analyst Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), and bomb technician Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) into Saudi Arabia by bending the rules of diplomacy and law.<br /><br />What ensues is a boring investigation in which the American team is delayed at every turn.  There are issues with gender, challenges with the ruling monarchy, and good old government politics. Where The Hurt Locker was a knuckle-biting series of escalating mental and emotional challenges, The Kingdom is a slow drag through a frustrating series of roadblocks that, while they may be realistic, don't make for good storytelling.<br /><br />After the good guys defeat the bad guys with a rote firefight, the American agents are ordered home - too easy, of course.  The real villains ambush our heroes as they depart and, after kidnapping poor Leavitt, helpfully lead the agents back to their lair and the man responsible for the bombing in the first place.<br /><br />The most tender moments, and the best acting, are from the children and their fathers.  Foxx spends most of the movie angry, but he comes to life whenever he interacts with the kids.  Unfortunately, almost all of those interactions are to deliver the news about the death of the kid's father.<br /><br />The Kingdom veers from trying to drive home the cultural differences of Saudi Arabia to a stereotypical terrorist plot complete with an attempted televised beheading.  When the same trope shows up in Syfy Channel's Sand Serpents, you know something's wrong.<br /><br />The real story belongs to Colonel Faris al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), who straddles the fine line between doing his job and loyalty to his country. If The Kingdom gets something right, it's in portraying al-Ghazi as a hero, a soldier, and a father. And that's what The Kingdom is really about - the sins of the fathers visited upon their sons. I just wish it didn't take so long to make its point.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>It's too bad that this fine action/themed film did not get it's due at the box office.  Well directed by actor Peter Berg who also does a small cameo in this flick, the cast is well served by Oscar winners Jamie Fox & Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner (Alias) and Jason Bateman as FBI agents sent to the Middle East to investigate a bombing which took the lives of civilians, American and Arabs, alike by a terrorist group. The tension is high throughout and the transfer to HD is excellent.  Fox more than makes up for his previous bummer, "Stealth", with this winner.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>5 stars for pure entertainment value, 3 and 1/2 stars actual Artistic Quality.<br /><br />What can I say, go into this one with low expectations as I did, and you should find it a great way to kill 2 hours.  Yep there are some stock Hollywood cliches especially during the somewhat slowish first 1/3, but the fight scenes of the last 1/3 of the film makes it all worth it, despite their fairly egregious implausibility.<br /><br />So suspend your considerable disbelief, and just kick back and enjoy the freeway chase, the neighborhood shootout and the apartment shootout especially the part featuring World Class Hot Babe Jennifer Garner putting a four inch blade into the back of some big burly A-rab's jihadi skull after he throws her around the room like a bag 'o potatoes.<br /><br />Along the way, there are some vague jabs at insight: we see that the Washington DC political establishment is very much in cahoots with the Saudi royals and that the Saudi royals are an equally dubious bunch; that the American diplomatic corps has no shortage of greasy careerist slimeballs; that the average American and the average Saudi both view each other's governments and cultures with comparable amounts of distrust and xenophobia, probably well-deserved; that both countries are in bed with each other for the same bottom-line economic and military conveniences, etc.  All quite reasonable and salient points no doubt, hardly original of course---but as one noted film critic pointed out, this is sort of like the "...For Dummies" version of "Syriana."<br /><br />In other words, the geopolitical backdrop is just a cool frame for all the state of the art bang-boom-bam boilerplate.  It's just loads of fun to watch the explosions and blood-splattering...I could watch the luscious Jennifer Garner running around in a snug and sweaty T-shirt with an automatic rifle in her hands dodging RPGs all day long!<br /><br />With the exception of Chris Cooper and the two lead Saudi guys (Ali Suliman and Ashraf Barhom), none of these guys are first-rate actors...but that's ok, director Peter Berg is smart enough to mostly spare them any overly challenging thespian moments, with lots of cutaways and jump cuts and cool music and visual atmospherics to keep us entertained.  The script has an admirably low number of clunkers for an action movie, too---not exactly Ingmar Bergman, but very few schmaltzy cringe-inducing moments, even at the end.  Don't know where this film was shot, but it does an excellent job of conjuring up the sights and sounds of Saudi Arabia which is a fascinating planet all unto itself.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>The movie starts sets out its stall right at the start, with the titles overlaying a potted history of Saudi so far, and how we came to the present time and the tenuous `alliance' between the US and Saudi.  From there we have a terrorist event which takes place in Riyadh, targeting Americans, so that the FBI feel the need to send a team, led by Jamie Foxx, and including an unlikely but strangely believable crew including Jennifer Garner (Alias, Elektra) and Jason Bateman (Arrested Develoment).  They have to work closely with the at first distant Saudi police Colonel whose job it is to protect them.<br />What follows is akin to any of a number of TV `procedural dramas', overlaid with the political backdrop of trying to function in the unique environment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  That is, until the last act of the movie, which then becomes a straight, but very effective, action movie.  Indeed, the action is some of the most thrilling seen for some time - while the hand held camera approach is somewhat annoying during the build up and political backdrop being established, once in the action scenes there is a visceral quality to events that really make you feel part of the action.  You can feel yourself ducking when the characters do, in effect!<br />Is it a politically aware movie spreading a message about Middle East relations?  Well, yes and no.  It is in most ways a straight forward thriller, done fairly well.  Indeed, once the action starts, you pretty well know how the rest of the movie is going to go.  However, the Saudis are not just presented as two dimensional bad guys, but a multi-tiered and multidimensional society, which is in itself an improvement on many other contemporary movies on a similar topic. And the final few minutes do espouse a level of political message not evident through the rest of the movie, allowing for some level of pondering and bar stool conversation after the movie has finished.<br />A decent thriller then, with just a touch of commentary on the subject of Saudi-US relations.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Movies focused on the Middle East as a theme seem to be all the rage for people in Hollywood. There have been several films that have tried to make essentially the same political statement over and over, such as "President Bush is wrong" or "This current war is unjust" or "It's all about the oil", examples of these sentiments would be the overtly political, dramatic films aimed at skewering the current administration or the war effort, such as; "Fahrenheit 9/11", "Lions for Lambs" (surprisingly written by the same writer as this film), or "Syriana". Few films these days seem to make any type of attempt to put a favorable light on the war effort or the Bush administration. A recent film release set in Saudi Arabia seemed to actually make an attempt to keep politics out of the film, or at least not focus on it, opting instead to merely show our government and its agencies trying to do the right thing by assisting others and showing the kind of jeopardy our soldiers face on a daily basis while doing their job. The film I am referring to is director Peter Berg's ("The Rundown" and "Friday Night Lights") high-octane military thriller "The Kingdom", starring Jamie Foxx ("Collateral"), Jennifer Garner ("Daredevil"), and Chris Cooper ("Breach").<br /><br />"The Kingdom" is the story of a team of FBI agents who are assigned to assist the Saudi Arabian government in solving a mass murder of both Saudi and American citizens, and bring the vicious killer responsible to justice before he strikes again. As the team begins their investigation they find themselves hampered by the limitations imposed by the Saudi government officials, and that of their own superiors who wish for them not to get too involved in the proceedings. But, through their sheer determination the team manages to break through these barriers, but just as they do, they find themselves as the newest targets for the very madman they are trying to stop.<br /><br />I am very much impressed by the talent director Peter Berg has for crafting an extremely intense movie experience full of racial tension, wartime conflict, tense drama, and a little bit of political intrigue without resorting to the same old attack the President or the current war tactics used by so many other directors in Hollywood. It's also surprising just how realistic this movie is, and just how serious the subject matter is when compared to the somewhat lighter content in some of his previous films, primarily "The Rundown" and "Friday Night Lights". It's evident that Peter Berg has definitely come a long way as a filmmaker and his movies speak volumes to that sentiment, as does his ability to get A-list stars for each of his films from Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson ("The Rundown") to Billy Bob Thornton ("Friday Night Lights") to Oscar winner Jamie Foxx for "The Kingdom". This is one director whose films seem to attract some of the best talent in Hollywood, and have so far appeared to be worth watching.<br /><br />The story for "The Kingdom" is a very tense, action-packed thrill ride that was very well-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan ("Lions For Lambs"). He has crafted an emotionally charged story that could have been ripped right from today's headlines, in fact according to director Peter Berg the film was based loosely on a story about a team of U.S. government agents attempting to assist in some sort of investigation in the Middle East and the hardships they faced in trying to do so. Kudos must also go to Matthew Michael Carnahan, along with director Peter Berg, in regards to resisting the temptation to include as much political leanings in this film as possible, opting instead to keep the focus on the U.S. agents trying to do the right thing, and leaving the politics out of the equation. However, Carnahan must have needed an outlet later on for his pent-up political thoughts that he didn't use in this film, thus releasing them via his overtly liberal script for 2007's "Lions For Lambs" starring Tom Cruise, Robert Redford, and Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The actors were all very impressive in their individual roles, each cast member that comprised the main characters was fully prepared for their roles and it showed. They all went through training courses on how to properly hold and fire weapons, clearing rooms where hostiles may be present, and multiple other military tactics; all of this was done as a conscious effort on the part of the cast and the director to make this film as realistic as possible and to respect what the men and women of our armed forces must go through on a daily basis.<br /><br />In the end, "The Kingdom" is a very well done military thriller that gives us a glimpse at what life is like for our soldiers, and for the people that are living in that region of the world. A very good movie that shouldn't be written off as being just another piece of anti-war propaganda, but as a movie that tries to show our people doing what's right even when their lives, and others we may not agree with, are at stake.<br /><br />"The Kingdom" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />VC-1 BD-50 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 1:50:20<br />Movie size: 31,66 GB<br />Disc size: 41,15 GB<br />Total bit rate: 38.26 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 28.55 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3679 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 3679kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />DTS Express  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 20<br /><br />#Bonus material (in Standard-Definition):<br />- Audio Commentary by director Peter Berg<br />- Freeway Sequence<br />- Making Of<br /><br />#Bonus material (in High-Definition):<br />- U-Control (Tutorial, The Mission Dossier, BonusView)<br />- Deleted Scenes<br />- The Mission Dossier<br />- The history of operation: Kingdom</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>First thing is first, OK! WE GET IT! A SHAKEY CAMERA MAKE THINGS LOOK MORE REAL!!! It also gets really annoying. Now, Chris Cooper is good in everything he does. Jamie Fox is so overrated it isn't even funny. Jennifer Garner is not pretty at all in anything and when she is in a movie where she wears no make up and only has her incredibly strange face and big fish lips to carry here she falls flat on her face. He acting skills sure aren't going to carry her anywhere. The Arrested Develpment guy, or whatever show he is on? Well, he was ok though his role was very cliche but I have one comment. How can  you get kidnapped and have your hands bound and have about 6 guys beat your face in unmercifully and when you get captured? You have a bloody lip? He must have the hardest head and the skin on his face must be like shoe leather.<br /><br />This movie wasn't bad and worth watching. See above for my rant but see the movie. It is not great but worth a peak. Oh... and Jeremy Piven? God that guy is annoying. He plays the same character in every movie he has ever been in and that character is... Jeremy Piven.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This is an out and out action film; my wife walked out after the first few minutes and didn't come back. I'll agree that it is violent but in the situations this film addresses, violence can and should be expected.<br /><br />The film provides some interesting insights into life in the Middle East; although I've never been there, news reports and video clips over the past several years seem to confirm the use of violence as a negotiating tool. Life in the Middle East, and especially in Saudi Arabia, reflects a worldview that is diametrically opposed to Western thought.<br /><br />The film is fast paced and moves toward an ending that even increases the pace of the action. As the film closes one is left with statements from both sides that indicate the struggle will continue; it is not just the individuals that are in opposition, but two opposing worldviews.<br /><br />Historians who address this struggle are quick to point out the fact that the battle has been going on for centuries with greater or lesser intensity. It appears that the level of intensity has been increasing again for several years now.<br /><br />The confrontations described in "The Kingdom" will not be going away any time soon, sadly to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This film seemed interesting because it was set in Saudi Arabia and plays to the paranoia that most Americans have about the Middle East.  Jamie Fox, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are cast as FBI agents who are sent on a mission to discover who, exactly, attacked the American compound, killing innocent family members of oil executives.  Naturally they encounter obstacles as they get little cooperation from the Saudi government with the exception of a colonel, played by Ashraf Barhom, a family man himself with a sense of integrity and who really does his best to help the Americans.  That's the premise.<br /><br />The film is full of those long chase and shoot-em-up scenes that are required in a modern geopolitical thriller such as this.  Perhaps they would have been more impressive in a theater, but they lose their effectiveness on a regular TV screen and I was soon bored with them.  The acting was adequate and what can be expected in a film like this but the most impressive performance was that of the Saudi Colonel whose humanity kept the film from falling into a formulaic good-guy - bad guy format.<br /><br />Filmed in Arizona, the film did its best to recreate what Americans tend to think of as the Middle East. But why, then, was Jennifer Garner allowed to run around in bare arms and a bulletproof vest when while all other females in the cast were covered from head to toe in black burkhas?<br /><br />I really shouldn't be reviewing this film because I'm just not into this type of a flick.  I therefore give it a mild recommendation as an action film set in an unusual location.  It didn't seem genuine to me but I know I'm not the target audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>A pretty good action/political thriller that's not entirely aimless. The ending is what's really honest and true and makes this a good film. The explosive visual effects and the directorial choices are excellent too. This is an ensemble movie, with Jaime Foxx doing a lot of the heavy lifting.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>I don't want to keep a potential viewer from watching the film as it really deserves a viewing, but personally I feel a bit as if the movie offers an ending just a bit too conveniently and neatly.<br /><br />In reality terrorism, at least of the type displayed within the film, is a very messy and very complicated life.  Finding a bad guy is tough enough in your own back yard, but finding a bad guy on foreign soil, in a land where there are many followers of such a bad guy is not going to be something that would be delivered in such a neat little package.  If it was so neat and easy, we'd have captured or killed the bin Laden types a long time ago, rather than seeing several volunteers popping up to take the place of the Lieutenants that we have been able to take down.<br /><br />The Kingdom presents fictional events and takes literary license and liberty with the levels of cooperation we might expect to see in solving an act of terrorism on hostile soil.  The actors here do a respectable job of presenting the story they've been given.  Jamie Foxx plays his role well, the always reliable and steady Chris Cooper does as well.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner do well enough in their roles too.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain a bit that Garner seems to be in the movie only to offer up tears, but I think those reviewers are missing the point by a mile and aren't catching the little lessons of how life in the western world differs from life in the Muslim world, especially when it comes to treatment of women.<br /><br />As noted in the title for this review, this is a solid film, though not spectacular.  Well worth viewing, with some interesting special features and extras available to enhance the experience (the various points of views of the climatic sequence in the film as an example).  See it if you have the opportunity but be forewarned that there are, as with any film really, some political messages hidden away within the film.  Not the type that beat one over the head in the manner of say an acceptance speech at the Academy Awards, but some messages none the less.  Mostly there to get viewers to *think* and that isn't such a bad thing really.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Starts with an expertly produced bloodbath...then a rather slow hour of investigation...ends with another bloodbath.<br /><br />I saw this in the same week as Eastern Promises and Sweeney Todd.

Along comes the Michael Mann-produced thriller, The Kingdom that attempts to fuse the action film with a dose of political intrigue while asking the age-old question, why are we over there? With Mann as producer and Peter Berg directing, it's a pretty safe bet that this film won't be a complicated expose of the United States government's foreign policy a la <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRM">Syriana (Widescreen Edition)</a> but closer to a kinetic thrill-ride in the vein of Ridley Scott's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008YLV2">Black Hawk Down (3-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a>.<br /><br />The Kingdom illustrates the point that we are losing the war in the Middle East like we lost the one in Vietnam because it is impossible to tell who the enemy are and who are our allies. At times, this film feels like a recruitment film for the FBI. Do yourself a favour and check out Syriana, which takes a much more complex, thought-provoking look at our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and why we are stuck in such a tricky political quagmire.<br /><br />There are 11 minutes of deleted scenes that aren't put in any context and lumped together. They do flesh out some of the relationships between characters but were probably cut for reasons of timing and pacing.<br /><br />"Character by Character: The Apartment Shootout" allows you to see this action sequence from the point-of-view of each of the main characters which is kind of a nice touch.<br /><br />"Constructing the Freeway Sequence" takes us through how they planned out and then shot this scene. As you would imagine, a lot of work when into coordinating everything and making sure that it was pulled off successfully.<br /><br />"The Making of The Kingdom" is a 35-minute, eight-part making of featurette. We get to see Berg and Mann talk about the genesis of the film. We see how the cast and crew prepared for the film, like learning to make bombs and how to fire guns. This is a pretty detailed look at many aspects of the production and offers some insight into how a film of this scale is put together.<br /><br />"History of The Kingdom: An Interactive Timeline" is basically breaking down the timeline we see in the opening credits into a slideshow format. However, there is very little additional information which is a disappointment.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Peter Berg. He actually visited a U.S. compound, like the one depicted in the film, in Saudi Arabia. He says that they wanted to create realistic, visceral action sequences and actually had to tone down the carnage of the terrorist attack that opens the film. He also addresses the criticism leveled at him that he relies too much on hand-held camera shots. All in all, this is a fairly decent track.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2007's "The Kingdom" opens with a prologue sketching the US relationship with its ally the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a major source of both oil and Islamic radicalism.  The movie properly begins in a "Little America" housing compound in Saudi Arabia, where we become uncomfortably aware of an impending terrorist attack. The attack itself is horrific, killing dozens of Americans and Saudis, and seemingly involving members of the Saudi police guarding the compound.<br /><br />FBI Special Agent Fleury (a steely-eyed Jamie Foxx) works a deal to get his Evidence Response Team into Saudi Arabia over State Department objections.  On the long flight over, we are introduced to Fleury's team: forensic expert Janet Mayes (a stalwart Jennifer Garner), explosives expert Grant Sykes (played with good-old-boy charm by Chris Cooper), and computer expert Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman).<br /><br />Their escort on the ground is Saudi Police Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (an agonized and movie-stealing performance by Ashraf Barhoum) who has been directed to keep the team alive and get them out of Saudi Arabia as soon as media needs have been met.  However, Fleury and his team are here to solve the crime, and they gradually win the trust of COL Al Ghazi and his assistant Sergeant Haythem (Ali Suliman).  Together, they begin to track down the killer, a murderous local terrorist cell leader.<br /><br />The atmosphere of the movie is brooding and intense, even claustrophic, as the team unravels the crime under a relentless sun, surrounded by Saudis of uncertain allegiance.  Their increasing success draws retaliation from the terrorists.  In a shocking freeway ambush, one of their number is kidnapped.  The survivors and COL Al Ghazi set off in hot pursuit, ending up in a dense urban neighborhood owned by the terrorists.  The ensuing gunfight is the payoff scene of the movie, a breathless sequence made even more intense by some superb cinimatography.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg for the most part avoided the temptation to politicize the movie.  An awkward attempt to suggest that violence begats violence is undercut by the stark moral differences between the FBI Team and their Saudi Police allies, and the murderous terrorists.<br /><br />The widescreen DVD includes deleted scenes that provide some useful exposition on how the team got into Saudi Arabia.  A separate feature breaks down the fast-moving climatic gunfight.  This movie is highly recommended as an intense and well crafted action thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>The movie has many pluses, not the least of which is the set-up and the setting. The terrorist bombing of the Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia is certainly timely and plausible. The film opens with little documentary on the history of Aramco which sets the tone, but the history scene is without content, as is the film. The compound is bombed, but there is never any clear point made about who the bombers are or why they have targeted these residents. Instead the film focuses on issues of jurisdiction and bureaucracy, which could be made interesting, but here too we get nothing substantive. Every set-up simply pits one of the pugnacious FBI agents against his hapless guard who is attempting to carry out his duties. The American wants to be made an exception to every rule, seemingly in each instance totally ignorant of why rules exist or what customs are. The female agent, for example, insists on running around around in a tight t-shirt, as though she were too stupid to notice that every other woman in the country wears traditional garb. If you don't understand at the beginning of the film why the Saudis may want Americans out of the country, you certainly do at the end, although I don't think this is the film's intended message. The actors do a fine job of playing obnoxious, clueless cretins with a talent for forensics. Beyond that I see no differentiation in the acting. When the shooting starts, only the Saudis get killed, although the picture opens with lots of innocent Americans dying. There is lots of lashing out, temper tantrums, terribly crude language, which the Saudis rightly ask be curtailed, but in the end nothing whatever has been resolved. This is a classic of much ado about nothing.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"The kingdom" is a film supported by a well built script, of beating actuality and brutal realism in all sense.<br /><br />The initial sequence provides us of fundamental information around some items of necessary relevance to understand the complex of mixed interests in conflict.<br /><br />A terrorist cell makes a coward attack over dozens of innocent people, this chain of events will lead to F.B.I. to make its appearance as a clash-force in order to detain and stop the future advances of this simple piece of a major complexity.<br /><br />But when the film reaches its entire development there are just there are three problems; the first one has to do with the not well achieved edition process, which makes you turn the attention from certain details of first-order ; (Please notice that, at the moment of the hair raising sequence of the ambush on the highway; make a pause on your DVD and rewind it in slow motion; then check the previous moments before the attack, observe how is the state of the highway, but immediately after, we have another landscape totally different (even the illumination changes); the  second one has to do with the continuity of the narrative thread (For instance, once they arrive to Saudi Arabia, we simply ignore what's going behind political spheres and the way this delicate incident strikes the public opinion).<br /><br />But the climax sequence is not only a deserved tribute to the famous film of Philip Noyce "Game of patriots" in a similar ambush in Bogot&aacute;, superbly well made.<br /><br />Those two defaults make I can't give the film five stars, despite of the fine performances, specially for the natural performance of the Saudi Colonel.<br /><br />The final lines in which we read the same advise for every one of the parts in conflict, express with bitter realism that this battle is barely a bit of a problem still major, in what concerns to the attitude of both sides.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>The Kingdom is definitely a great movie.

Moreover, the significance of this film is its clear message: "Let's get bin Laden." Recall the era this was released, and I'll get to that in a moment. I'm all twisted around: I had been wanting to review this film for nearly four years and didn't do it when I ought to have done.<br /><br />The great Chris Cooper (Grant Sykes, FBI bomb squad forensics specialist), who is the actor's actor yet seems like the reincarnation of Droopy Dog, really anchors this film and works beautifully with the others. The secret to any film is the director creating the good atmosphere for the actors - then the actors follow suit by bonding on film. We all love that and we in turn react well to it. I think the lack of that essence is the reason THE HURT LOCKER was so dreadful and IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH was even moreso.<br /><br />After a terrorist bombing at an American military and housing complex in Saudi Arabia, FBI special agent Ron Fleury (a very competent Jamie Foxx) buys the agency five days to investigate. They think it will lead them to a major terrorist (this is the "bin Laden" character). He gets the time, and with his team in tow (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman among them) he high-tails it to S.A. The investigation itself is fascinating, but what tugs at the heartstrings is the part of the investigation necessitating interviews with the American families living there.<br /><br />That is the part of the story arc that is telling us, "Let's bring our people home." Again, remember the year: we didn't know when, as or if we were getting out of Iraq or Afghanistan. This film, I think, lit a fire under certain posteriors. It really is that good. The downside is it really seems like an overseas episode of "NCIS" - bad for a feature film, but it isn't bad in itself. "NCIS" is perhaps the greatest TV series ever. What I don't like is the idea of a film copying it so obviously. There's homage and then there's "poetic stealing".<br /><br />This film has the muscle and beef to do it well: the cast is enriched by Richard Jenkins, Danny Huston, Jeremy Piven (who is an underrated sex symbol in my opinion), Kyle Chandler, Tim McGraw, and Kelly AuCoin. Though Huston's appearance seems either gratuitous or pointless, I like seeing him anywhere - just like Richard Jenkins.<br /><br />The technical skill of this film is not to be ignored: it is top-notch. The storyline seems bumpy because it is meant to be a bumpy film. I absolutely hate and reject the jiggly you-are-there hand-held camera crap, yet it is used well in KINGDOM. Like everything, this film lets nothing go to waste.<br /><br />KINGDOM grossed nearly $48 million in its November 2007 release. Hip 'young' director Peter Berg (whose only other big-time films are HANCOCK and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) really shines here, in dull, Cubist browns and desert tans. Berg creates these great atmospheres for his actors; it is a gift but many other directors could really learn from Berg.<br /><br />I will divulge/spoil no more. Just be aware that if you do not totally love this film, it will be good the first time then seem like an old TV rerun thereafter. I will get it for my video library one of these days, but I recommend caution to the general audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>The Kingdom is an action film that may have simple skin, but it in fact has some intelligence underneath it. This is a very good political action thriller that has high-octane action and lots of suspense. Unfortunately, some of the casting is a bit off: Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman give wooden performances. That's why I can't give this movie five stars (well, that and a few draggy scenes). Still, The Kingdom is a tightly written, well-directed, and highly explosive political action film. It doesn't have as much as action as, say, Hard Boiled or Face/Off, but it does give a very powerful message about terrorism and the negative perceptions about Islam and Muslims in general. This film doesn't disrespect Islam, but it does tell us about how people use religion as an excuse to get a point across. All in all, this is a good action film that's worth seeing if you're into politics, religion, and of course, action.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A team of U.S. government agents is sent to investigate the bombing of an American facility in the Middle East. There is much to like in The Kingdom. Nice performances, a slightly-new take on the buddy-cop story. There is a big terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia. Some FBI agents led by Jamie Foxx, fast talk and bamboozle their way into the country to investigate, where they team up with two Saudi cops. There then follows a small amount of detective work, some interesting political manoeuvring and two really rather well-done shoot outs.</p></br></body></html>

It is a mysterious and atmospheric ghost story involving a haunted house, and it builds its tension slowly (like The Haunting from 1963, and Alien from 1979). It is Spanish with English subtitles (and apparently reading them is a huge annoyance for some reviewers here).<br /><br />I will not get into the plot; the less known, the better. I will say that this is a film for people with a solid attention span who enjoy a moody film that features more anticipation of the unknown than it does cheap jolts or hatchets plunged into the head. It's worth mentioning that The Orphanage does feature a couple of ghastly/bloody moments, but not enough for lovers of modern horror movies.<br /><br />What I mean to say is that if you think this might be a cool horror flick, you just might be disappointed. Horror has many little genres to it. Horror fans have different tastes. This film falls into the creepy ghost story category. In addition, it's not only a ghost story, but also a story about loss and family and revisiting the past.<br /><br />I should also mention that The Orphanage becomes a potent mix of creepy and poignant, not unlike The Sixth Sense or The Others. If you liked the feel and look and mood of those films, you may enjoy this. It has good visual style and a very effective musical score.<br /><br />So, turn away from this movie if your tastes lean toward big shocks, blood, revenge, and slashers. This won't satisfy that craving. But if you like films that feature a strong atmosphere of dread, dark hallways, things that go bump in the night, and the supernatural, give this a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>THE ORPHANAGE is an excellent film of the ghost story sub genre and should even appeal to horror film fans who usually reject movies filmed in languages other than English.  The English subtitles may detract a bit from the scare factor but the very effective spooky imagery, haunting music and highly atmospheric setting soon make the viewer forget the spoken language is Spanish.  As the title suggests and like so many other classic ghost story films (THE CHANGELING, THE INNOCENTS and THE OTHERS come quickly to mind) children play large roles in both the plot and theme of the film.  And as in most horror movies the viewer must be able to suspend some disbelief concerning some of the characters' unlikely actions and some other unrealistic plot elements.  The film is well acted by actors who are mostly not well known to average American movie fans though Geraldine Chaplin who starred years ago as Tonya in the classic DR ZHIVAGO is perfect as the white faced medium Aurora.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A woman named Laura was a former orphan who lived in a nice orphanage that had a bad past raises an adopted son named Simon with HIV and a husband named Carlos as they were a happy family. Until one day, Simon discovers that he has invisible friends that he plays with and terrible memories from Laura's past have literally come back to haunt her as the spirits take away her son. Desperate to find her son, she feels an unworldy prescence in her house and calls on some local Paranormalists to help her, can she find out the mysterious secrets of the abandoned orphanage or will she loose her son?<br /><br />Smart, terrifying and starling supernatural Spainish/Mexican horror thriller import is one of the best horror thrillers in recent memory. Director J.A. Bayona and executive producer Guillermo Del Toro ("Pan's Labyrinth", "Hellboy 1 & 2", "Blade 2" and "Cronos") brings us a chilling tale about life and death in a positive and well done way. The performances are just terrific and the storyline is complicated but very good, i also like how they use old-school make up techniques instead of CGI at some parts and the ending is just amazing as it has to be seen to believe.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers an excellent high resolution quality in picture and sound as i believe this movie is better seen and heard on Blu-Ray. It's presented in Spanish with English Subtitles and has some good extras like three featurettes, still galleries, Teasers and Trailers, Poster explorations and rehearshal Studio featurette, i strongly recommend this great ghost story.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The Shining", "House (1986)", "Poltergeist", "Stir of Echoes", "Pan's Labyrinth", "The Others", "The Sixth Sense", "Final Destination Trilogy", "The Skeleton Key", "Stephen King's The Shining (1997)", "Making Contact (a.k.a.

The movie does a great job of presenting a puzzle that the mother has to solve to get her son back. The movie is scary, but the gore is at a minimum level. The horror of losing one's child is horror enough. The acting is superb. The plot is finely crafted. The movie introduces very minor story lines or themes that are nicely tied together at the end. I won't give up the ending, but it fits almost too nicely.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>A well-done, spooky ghost story devoid of whiz-bang special effects.

Along the lines of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone (Special Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CYLJ">The Others (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> this Spanish film proves to be a great haunting movie. Creepy in all the right places. Suspense builds throughout the movie at a perfect pace; this is basically the perfect formula film. First off, the acting is phenomenal. Every single actor, especially Bel&eacute;n Rueda, delivers an exquisite performance that comes off naturally.<br /><br />The film itself is the perfect formula for a horror movie. But herein lays one of the few flaws of this film: it is too formulaic. If you have seen as many horror/suspense movies as I have, you will be able to predict what happens in this film to a T. A bit predicable to the horror fan, the movie still manages to deliver great suspenseful scenes that made pause and become absorbed in the film. There were some scenes that should have been edited out, but the film had a great pacing, building the suspense on each and every scene. The movie had great pacing and great horror moments that left you wanting to see more. The cinematography and direction are the best aspects of this movie and what gives it that great feeling of suspense throughout. The storyline itself was pretty good, but left many things unexplained. I think that many aspects were inconclusive and unfinished. Still, the film is really good and it is one to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>This movie is a must see and one of the best. The film had a lot of twists toward the end but kept me interested. The film uses an unfolding mystery and atmosphere to create fear. The feel of this movie is dark and foreboding throughout the film. Simple things made this movie: the desolate seaside location...the cliffs...a burlap mask... The house itself is creepy with dark corners. Dripping water, creaking floorboards added to the ominous feel of the movie. Only one scene involved gore - and the entire theater gasped when it happened. Rueda is wonderful as the tormented mother Laura. She carries this film to the end with palpable desperation. She appeared thin, and was not made up with hair and makeup which created more belief in her character. Hollywood actresses could take notes on her believability and strong performance.TOP NOTCH scrip/chills & acting  MUST SEE!!! This movie has the feel the "The Others" and has an "M. Night" twist towards the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Orphanage" is a rare horror film whose strong emotions and believable motives make it a tear jerker as well as a supernatural thriller. Laura (Belen Rueda) spent half of her childhood in an orphanage on Spain's coast, before she was adopted. As an adult, she returns to the enormous and beautiful home, long since fallen into disuse, with her physician husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and 7-year-old son Simon (Roger Princep). The couple intend to re-open the establishment as a home for disabled children. But Simon's temperament is becoming belligerent, and he is fast accumulating imaginary friends. Then he disappears without a trace.<br /><br />This is a ghost story, but, in spite of its supernatural elements, "The Orphanage" has a rigorous logic. I appreciated that, as horror films so often get sloppy with their narratives. The story is propelled forward by two strong emotions: fear of whatever lurks in the house and Laura's fierce maternal love. Laura takes the audience with her on frantic searches for clues, which give the film an action movie pace and emotional immediacy between the thoughtful lulls. At the halfway point, I thought the film lost its pacing and went off the rails until I realized that the film -and the audience's perception of it- pivots at that point. Then I was impressed by the well-conceived structure.<br /><br />Director J.A. Bayona, writer Sergio G. Sanchez, cinematographer Oscar Faura, and editor Elena Ruiz, amazingly, are all working on their first feature film. Bayona harkens back to the best years of Hollywood genre filmmaking by creating the orphanage completely on a soundstage. It's a stunning set and a wonderful character in the movie. They go easy on the score and try to tell the story visually as much as possible. Belen Rueda makes us feel her anguish, desperation, and fear at the loss of her son. "The Orphanage" is top-notch gothic horror, comparable to the best psychological thriller/horror films that have come out of Asia in recent years. In Spanish with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2008): "When Laura Grew Up: Constructing the Orphanage" (16 min) interviews director, producers, writer, cast, et al about characters and themes, acting with children, the set, digital effects, and the score. "Tomas' Secret Room: The Filmmakers" (10 min) is a documentary in 5 parts about various aspects of production: the crew, the score, the orphanage, digitally effects, the title sequence. "Horror in the Unknown: Make-up Effects" (9 min) interviews the make-up artists about Tomas, Laura's leg, and Begnina's make-up. In "Rehearsal Studio: Cast Auditions and Table Read" (3 min), the director talks about working with the actors. There are 6 Still Galleries of 198 sketches and photos. "Marketing Campaign" includes 2 Spanish trailers, 2 US trailers, and 12 posters. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Orphanage (Juan Antonion Bayona, 2007)<br /><br />I was thrilled with The Orphanage just after I first saw it, and was all set to go round comparing it to Pan's Labyrinth like everyone else is doing. But then I got behind and didn't start writing this review for a week, and when I sat down to do so, I realized I'd forgotten a great deal of it. It took some serious brain-wracking and a consultation of a plot synopsis for me to start remembering scenes from the movie that had impressed me.<br /><br />Laura (Mar Adentro's Belen Rueda) moves back to her childhood home, an abandoned orphanage, looking to refurbish it and start a smaller, more intimate home for disabled children. She and her family aren't even settled in. however, when her autistic son finds himself some imaginary friend-- but just how imaginary are they, and what do they want with him? Distressed by this turn of events, Laura turns to paranormal investigators to find out what's going on.<br /><br />I think my problems with remembering the film have to do with my seeing Saint Ange last month, which riffs on many of the same themes and is, simply, a better and more memorable movie. Still, Bayona's first big-screen feature film does outdo a number of recent Spanish supernatural flicks that have made it over the Atlantic (viz, the awful Darkness). A second viewing reminded me what I liked about it the first time-- the acting is mostly solid, the atmosphere is well-done, the pacing and direction are both first-rate. Definitely recommended, but I'd suggest watching Saint Ange around the same time for a compare-and-contrast session. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Amid the current crop of slasherly, hyperviolent horror films, "The Orphanage," from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, stands out as an artful, restrained gem of the genre. The movie is driven by plot, personality, fine acting and gorgeous cinematography.  Although many elements are familiar (with wisps of "The Shining," "The Devil's Backbone," and numerous other classics...) the film still feels fresh.  Lead actor Belen Rueda's turn as a mother fighting to get her child back from the grip of supernatural forces is a powerful performance; indeed, everything about this film is well-crafted and intelligently assembled. Worth checking out!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>thought this was a very good suspense movie.there were a number of creepy moments,and thankfully no cheap scares.i also liked the fact that unlike in many of types of films,there are no gimmicky CGI ghosts that look ridiculous.the acting is very good too,especially from the woman who plays the mother.i did think it was bit long though,at 105 minutes.i think they could have stream lined it a bit and knocked off a few minutes.the movie is also quite bleak,a bit too much,except for the very last scene.and as for the ending,i' found it a bit confusing,but maybe it's just me,me,because after checking the boards i noticed many people seemed to have the ending figured out.anyway i'll have to watch it again to see if i can figure out what i missed.overall,i'd give The Orphanage a 3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>A workshop in being scary. Amid the dreck of the genre, this movie shines. Dread fills the room as you watch. There is a moment of insight, as in "Don't Look Now", that fills us with despair. What great movie making.

Put it on your netflix.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>Guillermo Del Toro delivers again!<br /><br />The Orphanage or El Orfanto, whichever name you would like to call it, is excellent!

Some of the finest films of the suspense-horror genre; The Haunting (1963), The Innocents (1961), are given the tip of the hat, and even the opening credits pay homage to the rapid succession of images in Hitchcock's classic, Vertigo.<br /><br />A successful married couple (Belen Rueda, Fernando Cayo), with an HIV positive adopted son buy the dilapidated and abandoned orphanage where the wife lived as a child. Their intention to turn it into a home for other disadvantaged children runs afoul when the young son experiences the presence of long dead children.<br /><br />What The Orphanage does so well, is master the classic jump-in-your-seat scare. Not the all-out, sudden horrific image of a grotesque, face ravaged killer with a bloody knife suddenly appearing on screen, but the subtle and equally compelling frights of a hand reaching out from the darkeness and a door slamming shut. The Orphanage earns it's shudders while absorbing you into it's somewhat traditional gothic story.<br /><br />It's a bit unfortunate that the story eventually overwhelms the tone of the film, and the last half-hour or so, becomes a fearless damsel-in-distress climax which is not entirely satisfying.<br /><br />The cast is fine with notably child actor Roger Princep as the son in a masterful blend of innocence and mayhem, and Geraldine Chapman, as part of a psychic investigating team, in a perfectly executed segment confronting technology with the supernatural. My highest marks though go to the creepy and quiet soundtrack, which had me second-guessing just which sounds were coming from the TV speakers, and which were the sounds of my own home at night.<br /><br />In Spanish with English sub-titles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>"The Orphanage" was the first feature film not only for director Juan Antonio Bayona but for a large portion of the crew, including the screenwriter and the cinematographer. The film, however, would be a remarkable achievement for the most seasoned veterans in the business. A haunted-house story in the classic tradition of "The Haunting" and "The Innocents," "The Orphanage" unfolds deliberately, planting all the necessary clues in due course, not revealing all its secrets till the very end. Bayona makes us care very deeply about the characters, particularly Laura (Belen Rueda), whose growing horror, desperation and despair mirrors that of the audience. "The Orphanage" is for the most part free of gore; Bayona, unlike most young directors today, realizes that what he doesn't show us is infinitely more horrifying than what he does. The final ten minutes will fill you with horror, but also with emotions far more mixed and complicated than horror, and that is what raises "The Orphanage" far above a mere genre exercise. Beautifully photographed and designed, impeccably acted by both the adult and child actors, "The Orphanage" will linger in your memory as the great ghost story that it is. Be sure to watch the short "Making Of" documentaries on the CD's Special Features section; they are informative and charming, and also serve to defuse any lingering fears you may have for the well-being of the cast!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Why is it that Spanish people make the best horror films? They just do! This, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, and THE OTHERS are some of my favorite horror films. They have the knack for tapping into my deepest paranoias and fears, and I love them for that. I've always enjoyed a good ghost story - "good" being the operative word. You don't find many good ghost stories lately. There is most definitely a drought, and so finding a film like THE ORPHANAGE is like finding a needle in a haystack - forgive the cliche. It is terrifying, it is beautiful, and it is heartbreaking. The performances, the direction, the writing, the score, and the SOUND MIX are all top notch and totally effective. I do not wish to go into the story or plot for fear that I may give something away, all that I know is that you should stop what you are doing and rent this, if you are in the mood for a chill. You will not be let down, trust me. You may even get emotional by the end of this film. It's rare to find a film that can scare the piss out of you and make you cry at the same time.<br /><br />RENT IT, BUY IT, whatever, just as long as you SEE IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Surprisingly restrained considering the trailer had so many threatening and spooky images. I will say that 'The Orphanage' does get an A for atmosphere, but reading subtitles during this film distracted me from the experience. I usually pass on films with subtitles, but this film seemed too good to pass up and there are always exceptions to the rule. It's a pretty easy film to follow, even though this was played up to be a very spooky film, I found it to be more sad than scary. The DVD transfer looks very good and this is worth seeing, but maybe rent before buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>As any film on unexplained or horror, a story of former orphan's plan to renovate her former closed orphanage building into a family-run seaside hotel, is lacking of any practical logic and far remote from reality as everything else occurred during run of plot rather psycho-delusive than worth being created at all.<br /><br />There are much worse movies of such gender and if some wasted time and money to watch, it is good for producers anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>THE ORPHANAGE is a tough film to review, as it had some really good points but some really low ones, too.<br /><br />The highest point comes from Guillermo del Toro's association with it. For those unaware, del Toro was the genius behind such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008EY65">Hellboy</a>, the new Hellboy II and the exquisite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a>. Visually wondrous and stark, del Toro has a discerning eye for what does and does not work, and one can easily see his input (as a producer this time) within The Orphange. Although he had a hands-off approach for this film, you can see it is distinctly del Toro in nature, with heavy shadows, complex film shots, and a movie that lets the images speak rather than a visceral score (which was minimal).<br /><br />Spanish stage-star-turned-film-actress Bel&eacute;n Rueda pulls in a fantastic performance as a returning woman to the orphanage she once inhabited as a child, but this time as owner of the failing building. Her pouty eyes, ruffled hair, and slumped shoulders gave her just the right mixture of attractiveness and cookyness that such a role demanded. When Laura's (Bel&eacute;n Rueda) adopted  son Sim&oacute;n (Roger Pr&iacute;ncep) goes missing from a party at the house/orphanage, Laura obviously does everything to try and locate him. Her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) also tries for many months but soon loses faith in ever finding the boy alive. He's probably right, too, since the boy was sick and needed daily medications. But Laura refuses to give up. She "feels" something in the house, just as Sim&oacute;n had before he disappeared. Sim&oacute;n kept referring to invisible friends who wanted him to stay and play with them. Laura and Carlos, of course, just assumed the boy to have an active imagination.<br /><br />But Laura begins awakening to memories of her time at the orphanage, and with this comes a flood of troubled remembrances. When a group of paranormal researchers are called in to see if they can find out what happened to Sim&oacute;n, Laura's suspicions are aroused further, but cause a rift to grow between she and her husband. Carlos soon leaves but Laura stays, and she starts "playing the game" that these memories tell her to (including a game of hide and seek that results in some of the film's scarier moments, "1 ...2 ...3...Knock on the wall.")<br /><br />Although the performances and filming were done with great care, the script itself was not. Deus ex machina rules the ending (just think of the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CYLJ">The Others</a> and you'll be real close). That this film has horror elements is undeniable, but genre-wise it doesn't quite fit. Although I don't think shoe-horning a film into a specific genre is a good thing, it does give the viewer a sense of what to expect and how the story will unfold. Not so here. The ending makes it a bit too sweet. Okay, so that might not be fair if you compare Pan's Labyrinth's ending and this one (true, they are similar). But Pan's Labyrinth had a much more cohesive story that came at you from a child's perspective. With The Orphanage, it is through Laura's eyes that we see this world, and she's a grown up with grown up ideals. Plus the brutality of Pan's Labyrinth was horrifically pulled off by the evil protagonist, while in The Orphange, it really had none other than its own circumstances.<br /><br />But if you're in the mood for something visually appealing, this one will stimulate that portion of your brain. Just don't expect a smashing success ...or a horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>There's no coincidence that Guillermo Del Toro presents this film, because he was last years director of the mammoth masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a> That years Spanish submission. And hiding in his huge shadow is J.A. Bayona, the sole director of this film. When you mistakenly put Guillermo's name all over this movie you have to ultimately compare it to the impossibly high standards of his making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone (Special Edition)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7ODI">Hellboy (Director's Cut)</a>. And for a beginning director that's too pretentios to imagine, so I'm going to guess he had no idea that marketing would present his movie to be easily mistaken with Guillermo's. It has none of the stylistic visual flair or the rich storybook imagination that comes with a pure Guillermo film. This film sticks to a few camera filters that drain bright colors and paint a glum picture that sufficates beauty and strangle-holds the actors life essence. Sure, that is the point made by the DOP, but I don't like it. The story is intelligent, sensible, and matter-of-factly/completely boring. The ending is a thriller/suspense cliche. It's as if Sergio G. Sanchez, the writer, flipped through a typical 'how to write a screenplay' from Barnes and Noble and then predictably counted his Plot points and delivered on Night S. Ending <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL3T">Signs (Vista Series)</a> because it was cool.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Film that explores themes of: childhood, death, motherhood and orphanage.  Produced by Guillermo Del Torro it still has dark tones similar to the ones we say in "Pan's Labytinth".  Some of the scenes are just too gruesome, even for the adults to watch.  We meet Laura, a woman who used to be orphan herself who now has adopted son Simon with potentially fatal desease.  Simon is a sensitive and lonely child and he has imaginary friends.  But when the circle of his imaginary friends starts to grow, his worried parents arrange for the children's party in their new home that used to be an orphanage where Laura grew up before she herself was adopted.  Before long, Simon disappears and police has no clues on his whereabouts.  The love that Laura feels for Simon is unconditional.  She wants to find her little boy no matter what the cost.  It is at that point that we see what a true motherly love is.  It is also heartbreaking after we learn that Simon's desappearance and ultimately his death is partially her fault too.  I liked film's idea on how living family left behind has strong ties with people they were close to once, long gone.  Just as Laura has strong impressions of her son being around, so does Laura's husband about her presence once she is gone to another world.  The bond we have with certain people is unbreakable between the two worlds.  It is there to sustain us in times of grief and emotional pain.  Not as powerful as "Pan's Labyrinth" but very touching nevertheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Not unlike its predecessor, Pan's Labyrinth, this film is beautifully photographed on a dramatic shore with a lighthouse and an old orphanage that has now become home to a couple with an adopted son.  That the parents have kept the adoption and the boy's HIV status a secret from him, and that his mother had grown up in the orphanage, set in motion a chain of sad and frightening events when the ghosts of dead orphans tell the boy the truth.  There's also a woman who had some information and was also a caregiver for a deformed boy; unfortunately, she is accidentally run over before she can tell Laura, the mother, what she needs to know.<br /><br />The boy, Simon, disappears with the ghost kids and his heartbroken parents spend months searching for him.<br /><br />All of this ends with life after death; Laura, Simon and the others die, but they seem to be very much alive, with Laura caring for them in the nursery since they will not grow any older, and Simon is reunited with her as well.<br />There is even a hint at the end that Laura's husband is greeted by her and the boy, though we will never know for sure.<br />It seems to be a common thread in this director's work that the living and the dead, the reality and the fantasy, are very close together and sometimes intermingle with each other.  I will be very curious to see what he does with The Hobbit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>THE ORPHANAGE is the latest supernatural film from Spain which definitely has the feel of Guillermo del Toro's influence. Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, based on the screenplay by Sergio Sanchez; the film is an enchanting, creative gothic horror film that follows the footsteps of "The Devil's Backbone", "Pan's Labyrinth" and "The Others". Much like the aforementioned films, "The Orphanage" has a theme to it, it is not a fast-paced horror thriller with the usual clich&eacute;s. The film is a clever, inspired production that gives a "nudge" towards our imagination. After all, our imagination and innocence gets lost when we grow up, corrupted by our own personal experiences.<br /><br />Returning to her childhood home; a mysterious seaside orphanage, Laura (Belen Ruede) and her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) has plans to reopen the orphanage to help underprivileged children as well as those children with special handicap. They have an adopted son named Simon (Roger Pincep), who is also suffering from HIV and has quite a "posse" of imaginary friends. When strange incidents happen in their home, and Simon mysteriously disappears, Laura must confront the secrets of her past and the otherworldly secrets of the orphanage before it destroys everything that she cares for...<br /><br />The Orphanage's plot is complex and intelligent, with a powerful script that grabs the viewer that may even give the feeling of a fable. The film has multiple themes as to what it is trying to say; such as listen to what children are telling you, interpretations of childhood and adulthood fears, and the danger of being stationary as time passes you by. The film is more of a mother's point of view of a certain fairy tale that takes a stab at our imagination and the things we take for granted. The film's execution is full of intrigue that is a welcome break from all the Asian horror remakes that Hollywood has bombarded us with. The proceedings have a creepy and eerie feel at times, dare I say also seductive?<br /><br />The film is also emotionally driven and it does take its time for us to get to know the characters. Laura played by Belen Ruede is a mother bent on helping children, the actress definitely expresses the needed emotions in supporting its carefully constructed story. While the film may support a slight pacing issue, I can excuse this minor fault since this film is Juan Antonio Bayona's full length directorial debut. Laura is a mother very much in tuned to her emotions while her husband Carlos is more of the rational kind. Once Simon disappears, the film takes off into a more intense but curiously enchanting pace; as Laura searches and obsesses in finding her son. The introduction of resident psychic Aurora and the policewoman, Pilar adds more controversy on the plate, since they were obviously set to confuse Laura and the viewer's opinions. Just who is Aurora? Is she a real medium or is she a con artist?<br /><br />It is very difficult to review "The Orphanage" without spoiling a lot of its effect. I believe I should stop here, before I say anything else. Suffice it to say that if you are expecting something scary on a very graphic scale or if you are expecting an experience that will give you non-stop visual chills, this film may not be for you. Don't get me wrong, the film does have its share of credible chills and shock value but it's the kind that stabs in your imagination. This type of feature will entangle you into its web and the more you're entangled, the better you'll enjoy it. The film is a genuine attempt in creeping you out more than scaring the pants out of you. It is a perfect execution of spirit world storytelling that leaves you an emotionally driven climax with a sensation of terror and disturbing comfort.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

Although technically a 'suspense thriller', this film will no doubt be catagorized with other ghost-oriented films.  Not a lot of gore here.  No graphic violence, either.  What we have here is mostly atmosphere; and it's intensely unnerving.  There are no 'quick-edit' scenes that seem to be in every horror movie these days.  No cheap startles designed to make the viewer jump.  It's just an incredible story of a mother's love for her child with the backdrop of a haunted house.  There's not a single wasted scene in this film.  Everything has its place and meaning.  It's so masterfully put together that even if you're not moved by the story itself, you'll be transfixed by the actual techniques used in this film.  This is not a 'special-effects' feature; just simplistic filmaking that could have easily been done forty years ago and still manage to creep the hell out of the audience decades later.  See this movie.  I cannot recommend it enough.<br /><br />~nico~</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>This is just a heads up on the release of the film rather than a review, which I'll do later.

Laura was adopted herself and spent time at an orphanage when she was younger. She returns to the same orphanage as an adult with her family to do the same thing for handicapped children now that it do for her so many years ago; take care of them until they can find families of their own. Sim&oacute;n isn't much different from other kids his age and has a couple imaginary friends, but it's when he meets a new one one day at the beach in a cave that things start to get strange. There's something more going on. It seems as if the children may have never left after all...<br /><br />The Orphanage is able to accomplish being the creepy masterpiece that every horror film in the past ten years has tried to be. That's not to say there haven't been good horror films in the past ten years, but there are only a handful and this one has to be close to the top. What sets this apart from other horror films is that it doesn't rely on cheap scares or CGI to try and scare the viewers. It's all about the atmosphere and it works so well. In general, I'm not a fan of horror films that are about ghosts. This seems to be on a whole different level though. It's also one of the more original horror films I've seen in quite awhile, which is quite a relief. I'm not sure about you, but I'm kind of sick of sitting through a movie and realizing it reminds me of this movie or this movie or it "pays homage" to three movies in one film. I'm not saying that influences are a bad thing, but originality is so hard to come by these days and I embrace it with open arms. It also seems like whatever movie Guillermo Del Toro is involved with can do no wrong, in my eyes. I know he only produced this film, but still. I've yet to see any movie with his name in the credits that I didn't love.<br /><br />I don't think this film is for everybody though. If you're looking for the next Ring or Grudge or if you're wanting blood spewing from amputated limbs, then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for an intelligent thriller that is heartbreaking yet beautiful, then I think this is a movie you should look into.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>The Orphanage is an atmospheric, frightening and moving horror film that was a runaway blockbuster in its native Spain (and a major success in much of the rest of the world as well).  When the now-adult Laura (Bel&eacute;n Rueda) returns (along with her husband and their young son Simon) to the closed-down sprawling manor that once served as an orphanage where she spent a short part of her youth, she hopes to re-open it and turn it into a more home-y and loving place for orphans, a place less austere and gloomy than where she spent part of her own childhood.  Things don't go as planned though.<br /><br />After Laura left the orphanage, a string of tragedies occurred there, most of which are not widely known and talked about, and some of which remain completely unsolved.  And ramifications of this dark past reach into the present - before the orphanage can even be re-opened - and result in the disappearance of Laura's son Simon, who before going missing has become convinced of the reality of his 'imaginary friend'.  The search for the missing Simon goes through the normal channels - police investigations and such - but in order to really find out what happened Laura's going to have to learn more about the true history of the orphanage, things she never guessed at at during her short stay there as a little girl.<br /><br />  The gorgeous Spanish seaside, an eye to visual detail, an array of subtle little touches in the background and undertext, and great cinematography all help to make The Orphanahge what it is, a movie that, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7J9R6">Dark Water [Blu-ray</a>] and the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009S54WC">The Eye</a>, mixes and contrasts terror and darkness with beauty and tenderness, all to tremendous effect.  It's worth noting that The Orphanage walks a path different from traditional ghost stories in that, while the ghosts can be (and are) scary, the ghost can just as often be a sympathetic character and much of the fearsomeness can come from the living instead of solely from the supernatural.  The Eye (and to a lesser extent, its remake) was like that too, where both spirit and mortal can be either good or malevolent, or often some strange (and tragic) combination thereof.<br /><br />The only possible shortcoming of The Orphanage will be that those who dislike ambiguous storylines and endings may not be fully satisfied.  It doesn't always tell you what certain events and implications mean, and you're left to figure some things out yourself.  I don't mind this kind of thing at all, and for me this was one of the best ghost stories ever told.  A must-see for horror fans, and even non-horror fans who like mystery and the supernatural (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783233477">Meet Joe Black</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IXXYBA">Ghost</a>) should check this one out as soon as possible.

In bare outline, it's really just the oldie about the family that moves into a creepy older establishment - in this case an abandoned orphanage with a very dark past - only to be hounded by the spirits of the people who died there under horrific circumstances.  Laura (Belen Rueda) is a woman who was herself raised there as a child and who has now returned with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep), to open a home for disabled children.  In no time flat, however, things begin going bump in the night, and Simon disappears under mysterious circumstances.  Could the souls of the children who died there be trying to contact the living, and could they be using Simon as a means of achieving that end?<br /><br />Anyone with even the most rudimentary knowledge of how such stories normally play themselves out should have no trouble divining the answers to those questions.  But in his debut as a director, Juan Antonio Bayona demonstrates a real flair for the macabre, so that every haunted-house-movie clich&eacute; - every creaking door, every sudden apparition - that comes our way seems somehow new and fresh again.  Perhaps it's the artful imagery, the fluid camerawork, or the highly effective soundtrack - or all three combined - that account for the movie's effectiveness.  Whatever it is, Bayona is able to imbue even the most mundane object - a playground ride, a child's doll - with the utmost menace and dread.<br /><br />Bayona has clearly done his homework, for, at times, the film seems to be channeling some of the "greats" of the genre, namely "The Innocents," "The Omen," "Poltergeist" (especially with its high-tech ghost-hunters and creepy psychic played by Geraldine Chaplin), and the original version of "The Haunting."  And because of the quality of the work here, the movie emerges more as an homage to those earlier classics than a slavish imitation of them.<br /><br />People may be divided over the story's resolution - finding it either immensely satisfying or unnecessarily corny - but no one can deny that, for genuine thrills and suspense, "The Orphanage" is one of the better horror movies of the past several years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>It is a horror movie of sorts, but also a tragedy, and tale of some spiritual dimensions.  Not your standard 'horror' fare or slasher film and audiences who don't come expecting that may find the story, upon reflection, to be quite seamless, clever and ultimately rather satisfying.  I give it 4.5 stars.  It isn't quite the odyssey that Pan's Labyrinth was (different director, same producer), but for what it sets out to do, it accomplishes much.  The cinematography is top notch, as is the acting.  Crystal clear transfer on the DVD.  A story with a bit of a twist.  A story that may leave you feeling oddly hopeful rather than frightened.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>This paranormal thriller relies on understated sensual creepiness, which is excellently depicted through sound and intriguing cinematography.  Foreshadowing is its own character, though the suspense trickily misleads.  The directorial debut of Spaniard Juan Antonio Bayona, the film's producer is Guillermo del Toro, of "Pan's Labyrinth,"  in which del Toro blends the spirit world with the mundane as effectively.  Its refreshing realism is a welcomed departure from Hollywood hokiness, though a couple of scenes would be considered graphic by most measures.  The story is compelling, most definitely sad and playing on the sympathies of the protective.  If you enjoy old school spooky films, this one is a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Those who like such films as "The Sixth Sense" and "The Others" (or Jack Clayton's "The Innocent" and Robert Wise's "The Haunting") should not miss "The Orphanage" ("El orfanato") directed by Barcelona-born Juan Antonio Bayona. The Spanish film is a rather remarkable effort in that, like a classic ghost story, the film, which cleverly uses some of the familiar elements from horror genre, favors atmosphere over logic, and it works.<br /><br />The following paragraphs contain a mild spoiler.<br /><br />[STORY] Laura (Bel&eacute;n Rueda) comes back to the abandoned orphanage by the sea 30 years after she left the place. This is where she was raised when she was a little girl, and Laura is going to open a new orphanage here for the handicapped children with her husband and adapted son Sim&oacute;n. When everything is going well, however, some strange things start to happen. And finally during the party Sim&oacute;n disappears suddenly, as if spirited away.<br /><br />Some say "The Orphanage" is a ghost story, some a supernatural thriller. Whatever the film is, it owes its success to Bel&eacute;n Rueda as Laura. The Spanish star literally becomes the character she plays, a tormented mother whose beloved son is long missing. Her acting is so strong and her character's sadness sometimes so painful to see that "The Orphanage" ultimately becomes an intense mother-and-son drama, even though the son is not always there.<br /><br />True, most of the narrative devices in the Spanish film "The Orphanage" are not particularly new - a little boy "speaking" with his "imaginary friend" or the "secrets" of an old house have been dealt with so many times before. But there is something very unique about The Orphanage," that is, something unnerving that curiously stays in your mind long after watching the film itself. It is hard for me to describe the nature of it. Maybe it is the shocking "truths" about the orphanage and the missing case. Or maybe it is some of the film's very spooky scenes or the ending that defies our expectations. All I can say is see for yourself.<br /><br />The film is co-produced by Guillermo del Toro, of "Pan's Labyrinth."</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I'd be interested to know whether this is an original story written for the film, or a screenplay based on a book. Either way its a high-class ghost story with more tension and suspense in it than I have seen in a film for many years. Stand-out amongst a very good cast is Belen Rueda in the leading role of Laura. Her performance as a former child resident of the orphanage who has now returned to own the property with her husband is superb.<br /><br />The nearest recent film you could compare this to is The Others, however unlike that film I felt much more involved with the characters in this film, and it will certainly keep you interested for its full 105 minutes as well as maintaining a level of intrique throughout its length as well.<br /><br />What this isn't is yet another torture-porn movie with the requisite number teenagers being hacked into small pieces. Neither is it a film with exploding cars and endless gunfights. Don't misunderstand me theres a place for those films, and I've watched many of them, but I'm grateful for something different every so often.<br /><br />This is different and for me gets 4.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I love a well-told ghost story.

I was very satisfied w/ the story, the heavy atmosphere, and the puzzle to be solved. The ending is both terrifying and heart-breaking at once. THE ORPHANAGE deals w/ the agony of tragic loss as well as the supernatural. It is a human story that slowly shifts into nightmare. It is also about the unbreakable bond between a mother and son. Highly recommended. Spanish w/ english subtitles...</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I'm not a fan of horror movies in general, as I don't like gore.  But I do love a good, spooky thriller.  And this movie is one of the best I've seen - better than " The Sixth Sense", or "The Others".  I heard about Guillermo del Toro when he did the first Hellboy.  I became a fan after seeing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a>.  Del Toro has a real gift for building tension - this film is creepy, jump in your skin suspenseful and though I guessed where the plot was going, the ending still had a good twist.  Even more, the ending was near perfect and tied all the bits together without blatantly answering one question - are the ghosts real?<br /><br />Laura was raised in an orphanage.  Years later she returns there with her husband and son to open a home for ill children.  The day the children arrive, Laura is attacked by a child with a burlap sack mask and her son Simon disappears.  The police are called in, a massive search is conducted but he's not found.  At this point, strange things begin to happen in the house.  Banging sounds, flashes of visions.  Laura suspects Simon has been kidnapped by ghosts and calls in a medium.  Her physician husband obviously fears for her sanity.  Yet, the audience is never certain if these are the actions of a desperate mother, or a woman who's truly being haunted.  There is a lot of emotion in the story, giving the film a surprising depth.  The acting is superb, and rarely over the top.  Music is used almost sparingly - never actually creating the suspense, only enhancing it.  I thought this was especially good filmmaking as too often the music gives away that something is about to happen.  One of the best scenes in the movie is when Laura turns her back on a dark room playing a counting game - the first time she turns around, ghostly forms of children appear across the room.  Each time she counts and turns around, they have moved closer.  It was so creepy my skin crawled!  Overall, a stunning movie that I will definitely watch again.<br /><br />The DVD has a few featurettes, the best of which is the making of, "When Laura Grew Up" which includes interviews with the cast and filmmakers.  I think this movie would have exploded at the box office had it been in English - which is a shame.  I do regret that the DVD has no dubbed track.  I noticed many reviewers complained about this, and were sniped at by fans of the film.  That's a little unfair.  I have family members who can't read subtitles fast enough to keep pace with a film.  If they are reading the subtitles, they miss what the characters are doing on screen.  I don't mind subtitles as I understand that something can be lost from the original language, and I read fast enough.  But many people missed out on an excellent film because they can't read fast enough - especially for a movie with twists, and little clues taking place on screen so frequently.  Those who can follow subtitles could still enjoy the movie as intended, but a dub track would expand the audience a little more.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro got behind this movie for good reason.

The abandoned lighthouse on the cliff not far away no longer shines a beacon. The cave below and the sandy beach still receive the incoming tide. Be wary. Laura Sanchez grew up in the orphanage. When she was about seven she was adopted and left. Now she is 37, married to Carlos, and they are parents to a little boy, Simon, about seven. They adopted Simon, who doesn't know this, and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay. Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in. It is a large building of many rooms and hallways, with dark oak paneling, old fire places and frosted, etched glass. They hope to make it a home for children with special needs. There are no children yet, just Simon.<br /><br />Simon makes friends, make-believe friends. They tell him things, he says. "I won't grow old. I'm not going to grow up," he tells his mother. "Will you be like Peter Pan?" Laura asks. "Like my new friends," Simon says. "There's more than one?" "Six." "They won't grow up either?" Laura asks. Simon looks at her. "They can't," he says<br /><br />Simon leads Laura in a game to discover clues, a game he and his friends have invented. Suddenly the game is foreboding. "You're not my mother!" Simon screams at Laura. "Who told you that?" she asks, stricken that this little boy, her son, is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older. "My friend told me," Simon says. "What friend?" "Tomas," Simon yells, crying and defiant. "Tomas told me the truth, that I'm just like them.... I have no mother or father and I'm going to die."<br /><br />Days later, Simon disappears, apparently kidnapped. The parents, with Laura increasingly frantic, try everything to find him. In time, there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans. We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left.<br /><br />So...whose imagination, whose story are we inhabiting?<br /><br />"Horror" is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so. Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things. Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects. The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie. It is lonely, deliberative, sad, thoughtful, even quiet, even, surprisingly, with a degree of contentment at the conclusion.<br /><br />All the actors do fine jobs, and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near. It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special. There are so many opportunities for intense "acting," distraught "acting," tearful "acting." Rueda does nothing of this. We believe her as Laura because she doesn't try to over-dramatize Laura. Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught. She also puzzles through this mystery, is determined to find her son and can take action. But Rueda never overacts. Thanks to Rueda's performance and fine directing and screenwriting, I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie.<br /><br />The audio and video transfers are very good. There are some typical "How we made the movie" extras. If you have a taste for unusual and unsettling stories, I recommend you try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X75EC">The Innocents</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The Orphanage, does bring sophistication in ghost stories which is rarely heard of, but Guillermo Del Toro manages to pull it off time and time again, and somehow he even managed to inject his magic into this one, which he only produced - as this very much plays out like one of his own films. Not to discredit Mr. Bayona, though, for he has done a fine job. This is a dark, powerful, and moving masterpiece that both adheres to convention and brings some new, more artistic elements to the table in the direction and storytelling.<br /><br />There was nothing about this film I didn't like. The acting, the thrills, the cinematography, the story, and the atmosphere. Everything was not short of sheer brilliance. The chilling moments freaked me out a couple of times, which I'm glad they did. That was what I wanted out of this film, but I was offered so much in return. Since I knew Guillermo Del Toro was involved with this project, I had a feeling it would be good. I just didn't think it would be THIS good. It was also very heart-warming, which was something I did not expect.<br /><br />The acting is great, Belen Rueda as Laura is magnificent. Fernando Cayo as the husband Carlos is also good; he looks like a Spanish version of Josh Lucas. The kids do a decent job. And seeing Geraldine Chaplin (Charlie Chaplin's daughter) was a surprise, and she delivered an excellent performance as the 'seeing' medium. The bond that Laura, Simon, and Carlos shared is very sensitive and is carried out well throughout the movie.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those horror films you should see more than once. The horror films you see nowadays are weak, not scary, and most of all; not worth your time. This one is WORTH the time. Believe me, his film has absolutely everything you need to know on how to make a well-executed ghost story and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>First let me say that I always research a movie before I buy it, even it that means just turning the case over and reading the back, Is it wide screen? Check. Is it English, or Spanish or German? Check, I do not just buy one because it's "supposed" to be "like" some other movie. Foreign movies offer us so much but so many people shun them because they cannot get past the subtitles "I couldn't read and watch at the same time" that baffles me, you can't drive and read road signs either? Or commercials with words? Not everything is in English, and let me give you a word of advice, listening to the dubbed versions is an affront to the movie makers and the actors in it. 90% of the movies charm and impact is in the voices, the sounds, the accents, open your mind a smidge and you will fall in love with foreign films as much as I have.<br /><br />The Orphanage is not written by Del Toro, he is a producer. It is written by Sergio Sanchez and directed by Juan Antonio Bayona. Del Toros name is on the front, because he is a well known and well respected writer director and producer and the masses will identify that this movie has someone amazing backing it. You should not however think that this movie is supposed to be like Pans Labyrinth or Hellboy.<br /><br />The Orphanage, La Orfanato is a skillfully made ghost/love story that is masterfully told and amazingly hauntingly beautiful. It's the kind of movie I wanted to see as a child, a story with everything!! It's not full of clich&eacute;s, unless loving and losing a child is a clich&eacute; now? It's a ghost story, there is going to be similar aspects to other movies, but resist comparing it and begin to understand it better. God, it's so gorgeously saturated with grief and beauty and emptiness and longing and hope, I couldn't stop my heart from almost bursting.<br /><br />I love when movies take back that frightening feeling with good old fashioned storytelling instead of fancy schmancy special effects like herky jerky motions and Computer generated craziness that you know isn't the least bit real. I would love to watch it in black and white one day!<br /><br />Love the addition of Geraldine Chaplin as the Medium, Charlie's Daughter is a wonderful riveting actress!<br /><br />So go rent this, buy it and I warn you don't watch it at night!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The Orphanage or El orfanato is a horror film directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and produced by one of the most creative filmmakers around today, Guillermo del Toro (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WSLAUO">Pan's Labyrinth</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V00">Hellboy</a>).  I was just having a conversation with my brother the other day about horror films and how I often, unintentionally perhaps, rate them on a scale.  In other words, a four or five star horror film is probably not the same as a four or five star drama in most cases.  The Orphanage really is a four star movie because it is more than your typical horror fare.  Let's call it a supernatural thriller instead.  It was nominated for 14 Goya Awards and won seven.<br /><br />The film opens at an orphanage and we briefly see young Laura find out that she is leaving.  Years later and Laura decides to return by actually buying and living in the orphanage with her husband Carlos and her son Sim&oacute;n.  Sim&oacute;n makes several imaginary friends and the plot unfolds with a series of effective and believable twists and turns.  It would be a mistake to give anything else away here.<br /><br />It really is impressive how far a film like this can go with good acting, smart writing, and solid suspense.  After the movie was over I realized that the twists were unpredictable to me because I wasn't waiting to find out what they were.  I was preoccupied with an engaging screenplay and atmosphere.  I actually cared about the characters too much to focus on forecasting the secrets.  The Orphanage made me excited to go along for the ride without even realizing.  Bayona had me trust his film at just the right times and for that I was caught off guard, and the film's surprises were far more rewarding.<br /><br />While watching this movie I kept thinking of films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783116926">The Changeling</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CYLJ">The Others</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a>, or even del Toro's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone</a>.  I probably think of those movies not just because they are like-minded supernatural thrillers but because they are impeccably well crafted films.  I give The Orphanage a very high recommendation and it is probably the best movie of its kind from 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>The Orphanage is one of the best genre horror films in recent memory period.  To be sure, there have been unique horror films that have transcended the genre.  But every now and then, it's nice to sit down and watch a good chiller that has all of the neccessary ingredients to frighten, terrify, and possibly even move you.<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro serves merely as a producer on this piece while Juan Antonio Bayona directs.  The subject matter has the feel of Del Toro and that may have a little to do with why his name is attached to this.  The story involves Laura and her husband Carlos and their purchase of Laura's childhood orphanage.  She wants to reopen it as a home for kids with special needs.<br /><br />She has a son, Simon.  He's very sick, but does not know it.  He has imaginary friends who become ever more apparent as the film progresses.  The thing is, throughout the film we are faced with a question.  Are these imaginary friends possibly ghosts.  Well they may be if you believe in them.<br /><br />That's really the film's success is that you really are guessing to the very end about what's going on.  Even then, I've seen film goers with various theories about the film, which makes Boyona's debut all the more auspicious.  But it's more than twists and turns that make this film.  It's got an eerie ambience.  Big old houses are breeding grounds for horror on film.  Boyona knows this and uses it to his advantage.<br /><br />The film's emotional appeal is another enjoyable facet of this film.  The characters are incredibly complex.  Laura is the unlikely horror heroine.  She's smart, but obviously terrified of what is going on.  She's unrelenting and very resourceful.  She's not your usual horror character.  Really, we are faced with none of the usual horror arechtypes in this film.<br /><br />Boyona's film is fairly straight-forward suspense-horror.  But it's delivered quite well and is one of the most enjoyable ghost type horror films I've seen in years.  If the Asian horror genre is starting to feel dried up, then Boyona might open up the door for more horror masters from Spain and beyond.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Having the honour of being presented by celebrated director, Guillermo Del Toro, Juan Antonio Bayona's horror film is another example of the atmosphere over blood and gore approach that I tend to prefer in this genre. Associations with Del Toro led to inevitable comparisons between this film and Pan's Labyrinth but I prefer to judge a film on its own merit so how did The Orphanage fare?<br /><br />The film begins with images of an orphanage by the coast where one of the resident girls, Laura, has been approved for adoption. Years later, Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to live in the same orphanage with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their son, Simon (Roger Princep), where she intends to provide a home for handicapped children. The family haven't been there long when Simon, who already has a group of imaginary friends, suddenly makes a new one called Tomas (Oscar Casas). His parents dismiss this as a phase but when Simon reveals Tomas has told him he is adopted and that he is ill (he's HIV positive), Laura begins to suspect something sinister is going on in the orphanage. Her fears are realised when she encounters a child wearing a sack mask that locks her in the bathroom and when she emerges Simon has vanished!  The film traces the following months as Laura and Carlos try to deal with Simon's disappearance and, in desperation, turn to a medium to help unravel the mystery of what has happened to their son.<br /><br />The first notable thing about The Orphanage is that it manages to convey a very tense atmosphere throughout. Familiar tricks of the trade such as inexplicably closing doors and footsteps at night do not seem old hat here but merely add to the overall tension. You always feel something bad is going to happen, you just can't figure out what. The scenic, but isolated, setting by the coast with a lighthouse in the distance creates further unease as does the cave by the beach where Simon first meets Tomas and leaves him a trail of shells to guide him to the orphanage. Laura later finds the shells stacked outside the orphanage!<br /><br />Rueda brings a lot to the character of Laura who appears to be the only one that realises the orphanage houses some threat that she believes to be responsible for the disappearance of her son. Carlos is supportive of his wife but does not think her fears have any substance and that Simon has obviously been abducted, most likely by the social worker, Benigna, who Laura argues with at the start of the film and who is later found snooping around the garden shed outside, which adds to the intrigue of the plot. It's not obvious what has become of Simon or who Tomas really is until the latter stages of the film where a shocking twist is waiting.<br /><br />Though atmospheric, The Orphanage is not particularly scary. The sight of the masked Tomas was one of the most sinister images but he is sadly underused in the film. First appearing at a children's party we next see him approaching Laura before trapping her fingers in the bathroom door when she tries to remove his mask! After this initial introduction his appearances are very limited as the environment of the orphanage takes over as the instigator of the uncomfortable tension in the air. The arrival of the medium to unlock the orphanage's secrets is one of the tensest moments as she is watched on several screens wandering the house alone while describing voices and witnessing the other unseen residents in the house!<br /><br />The Orphanage is an effective horror film despite the lack of real scares. The tense atmosphere from start to finish keeps it together and the plot remains captivating and difficult to unravel, with a horrifying twist at the very end. Though not the best horror film to come from outside Hollywood I still believe America should look at this one and take some notes. The Orphanage has a lot to offer but a few genuine scares could have made it a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Well above average haunted house film. As emotional as it is scary.<br /><br />The same could be said of most of producer Guillermo Del Toro's films.<br /><br />The story feels a little too familiar for most of it's length to quite<br />make it to classic film status, although the last 10 minutes do<br />elevate it to something more moving and more thoughtful than 95%of the<br />genre pictures currently being made.<br /><br />Wonderfully acted by Belen Rueda, as a mother whose child mysteriously<br />disappears. Well shot as well.<br /><br />The kind of film I look forward to re-watching, sure that now that I<br />know its secrets, there's even more to be uncovered.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Laura [Belen Rueda] returns to the orphanage of her childhood, to turn it into a home for children with special needs. Her son, Simon [Roger Princep], seems to be having difficulty making the adjustment; the number of imaginary friends he has is multiplying. When Simon disappears, however, Laura begins to wonder whether these imaginary friends are truly imaginary. The police give up the search, then her husband, Carlos [Fernando Cayo]. But with the help of a psychic, Laura continues the search, enlisting the help of his friends, who she believes are ghosts. As the psychic says, it's not that you see to believe, you must believe to see. Laura must have faith if she is to find her son.<br /><br />The Orphanage is a beautiful tale of love and faith, and the magic of believing. If you don't believe in ghosts by the time this picture ends, well, I feel sorry for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>THE ORPHANAGE is scary.  Not Hollywood-hey-let's-show-all-our-cards scary.  I'm talking about cover your eyes, look away, symbolic terror.  A woman wiping her face with what we know to be human ashes.  Creepy figures half-seen and then gone.  This is a film that gets under your skin.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple: Laura moves into the orphanage where she grew up.  With her is her adopted son Simon and her husband Carlos.  Before moving into the Orphanage, Simon had two imaginary friends; after a day in the new place, he has six.  And then a strange old lady shows up...and then Simon goes missing.  Months pass, and eventually Laura feels compelled--against her husband's wishes--to seek help from beyond.<br /><br />The film plays with typical horror stereotypes: creepy old buildings; creepy little children; creepy old people.  What makes everything work here is director J.A. Bayona's understated style; he doesn't spell things out for us, he lets the tension--and character development--build, until we reach a gut-wrenching climax.  You can see it coming, of course; the problem with horror films these days is that there's not a lot that hasn't been done.  Thus, we must focus on HOW it is done; and in this regard, THE ORPHANAGE excels.<br /><br />The lead performances from Belen Rueda and Fernando Cayo are rock-solid; supporting roles--especially an incredibly spine-chilling turn from Geraldine Chaplin--are just as good.  In case you're wondering: Guillermo Del Toro's presence is felt, but only in an off-hand way.  Some scenes are so horrifically beautiful, one can't help but be completely awed.  This is, ultimately, a beautiful little film; not the greatest horror movie ever made, but certainly a rare treasure, and proof that there is still gold to be mined in the genre, even if it takes a fresh face like Bayona to find it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Creepy tale of missing children and desolation, plays as a cross between 'The Ring' and 'Pan's Labyrinth'.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>The Orphanage (2007) - directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, is produced and introduced by Guillermo del Torro whose ghosts films El Espinazo del diablo and Pan's Labyrinth most certainly were the inspiration for the first time director. The films "The Others" and "The Stir of Echoes" also come to mind, as perhaps, Friday the 13th  and the story of Peter Pan which may be the main inspiration for the film that looks at the story of the boy who never grew up and stayed in Neverland from the point of view of his mother. The orphanage is unsettling, scary, very moving and intelligent. It does not show the monsters, it implies. It makes us to identify with its main heroine, the orphan herself who after many years comes back to the very house she used to share with her childhood friends, also orphans and where she wants to open the house for the handicapped children. Little did she know that the old house has deep and horrifying secrets that may affect her life, sanity, and the lives of the dearest and closest to her. Very good film, creepy, and heartbreaking. The final moved me to tears.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed The Orphanage, it was a unique and different horror film. Sure it has its flaws, but it was really enjoyable which is no surprise considering Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy 1 & 2, Pan's Labyrinth) helped make this film. Like Pan's Labyrinth this film is in Spanish, and as a foreign film it is definitely superior to most American-made horror films.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Laura is a 37-year-old woman (She looks like she's in her 50's though) who was an orphan during her childhood has now returned to her childhood home, moved in and is converting it into a home for children with special needs with her husband and adopted son. During the beginning of the film, her son keeps saying he's made a new friend named Tomas, but there's no one there. During a party celebrating the opening of the home, Laura's son disappears mysteriously without a trace. Then the rest of the film focuses on the months Laura spends trying to find her son and she discovers that her son's imaginary friend Tomas is an angry ghost who died years ago and Laura slowly uncovers what happened in the Orphanage those many years ago, and she slowly goes crazier by the day and no one believes what she says.<br />MUSIC: The music is creepy and suspenseful as it should be in any horror film and is very well done.<br />ACTION: Don't expect some bloody gorefest out of this film or some stupid cliched ghost story like The Messengers, no this film is focused almost exclusively on dialogue, with the occasional scare. But when this film wants to be frightening, it damn sure gets the job done in this category. This film is superior to just about any ghost film I've ever seen and is well-executed and it does not feel cliched (Except for the part when they rip off Poltergeist). This film as a whole is quite brilliant, even if its quality suffers do to moments of boredom. This film also has one of the most bizarre endings I've ever seen that will definitely leave you going; "What the f***?" but in a good way.<br />ACTING: There were some awkward moments, but the actors were very good as a whole. The dialogue was never really corny and it felt real most of the time and you actually seemed to feel that characters were scared. Props to the actors for their great performances.<br />OVERALL: The Orphanage is easily one of the most original horror films ever made, and is definitely better than most of the ghost films you'll find. Buy it now, dammit.<br />THE GOOD: Great acting, great music, intelligent storyline, and creepy imagery.<br />THE BAD: Moments of boredom, some questionable acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>This is a very well done horror movie.  Guillermo has certainly proven himself at very adept at creating moods, fantastical sets, etc, and this is no let down.  Good story, and a few scenes of very scary stuff.  Before you know it, you don't even realize its subtitled.  Very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>THE ORPHANAGE is a terrific ghost movie.<br /><br />Not only does it have plenty of moments that will make you jump in your seat, and I can assure you that I did several times, but it also contains a very intelligent, human story that makes you care about the people involved.<br /><br />The exquisitely photographed Spanish-language picture (with English subtitles) was directed by J.A. Bayona and co-produced by Guillermo Del Toro.  The filmmakers describe it as "a Peter Pan-like story from the mother's point-of-view".<br /><br />Belen Rueda, in an award-worthy performance, stars as "Laura," a wife and mother, who with her family buys the seaside house that was once the orphanage where she was raised.  They have no sooner moved into the mansion when her son starts seeing "invisible friends," and shortly after that, he disappears.  Laura's husband (Fernando Cayo) thinks the boy was kidnapped, but Laura is positive that he was taken by the ghostly children in the house.<br /><br />Geraldine Chaplin has a strong cameo role as a medium.<br /><br />Leave the lights on for this one.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>The Orphanage is a ghost story in the classic tradition [at various times whilst watching this I was reminded of some of my other favorite ghost stories such as The Changeling, The Others, and at one point, even Dark Water, the Japanese version]. It is high on atmosphere [the imposing gothic mansion in a remote location, sinister looking people, mysterious noises] and has a riveting plot.<br /><br />The story centers around Laura [Belen Rueda] who has moved into her childhood home, an orphanage, with her husband Carlos [Fernando Cayo] a doctor, and their 7 year old son Simon [Roger Princep] who like most children his age has an overactive imagination and an abundance of imaginary friends.<br /><br />They settle in nicely into the old mansion until one day when they go down to the beach to play - Simon lingers in a cave and when Laura comes to get him, he claims he was talking to a 'friend' and even leaves a trail of seashells so that his friend, Tomas can follow him back to the house. At first Laura dismisses Simon's ramblings as the figment of his imagination but soon comes to fear a more sinister  force at play as a game of  'find the treasure' seems much too elaborate to have been cooked up by Simon, revealing a secret that she wishes to keep from Simon.<br /><br />The story gets truly going when a party to welcome the newcomers [Laura and Carlos had decided to take in about 5-6 children into their home, all with some sort of disability] results in the tragic disappearance of Simon [who had opted to play with his imaginary friend than join in the festivities]. The rest of the story centers around Laura's desperate attempts to find her son, even resorting to hiring psychics [one played by Geraldine Chaplin in a very credibly portrayed role] whilst her husband plays the role of the skpetic, refusing to believe in any supernatural explanation for Simon's disappearance.<br /><br />There are some truly chilling moments in this movie - the sinister child with a sack over its face watching Laura in a darkened hallway, mysterious banging sounds that waken Laura at night,the psychic summoning and the discovery of some of the house's old secrets - all these add to the storyline and keep viewers engaged. Though the acting itself is not extraordinary, except perhaps for Belen Rueda's convincing mother in distress Laura, and Geraldine Chaplin's psychic, this is not an issue for the real pull of the movie lies in the subtle unfolding of the plot through a series of 'clues' that lead Laura to what she seeks.<br /><br />A highly recommended ghost story that doesn't rely on any gore, sex or unnecessary special effects, but allows the natural light and atmosphere coupled with some very effective old school effects to tell a classic ghost story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I hesitated to watch this movie as it was in spanish with subtitles. Boy am I glad I did.<br />This movie really pulls you along until the final moments. It starts with a good pace and gains momentum as the minutes go on. I felt myself completely drawn in, which is not easy to do.<br />I won't cover the plot here, that's been done already. I will say that if you want a movie that will make your skin shiver and have you jump at every noise then this is the one. Definitely made for scares and thrills. I hope we see more from this director.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>As "The Orphanage" came on the heels of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a> and is produced by Pan's director Guillermo del Toro, it is inevitable that comparisons will be drawn between the two movies.  "The Orphanage," however, is more straight forward horror, and has a bit of a conventional premise... until the mystery begins to unravel.  It starts as what seems to be a simple "ghosts captured my kid" story but evolves into something deeper and quite a bit darker.<br /><br />I'm not sure that the writer and director of this film get the credit they really deserve.  Screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez cooked up an intelligent horror film that delves into both dark territory and true emotion, bordering on but never crossing the line into sentimentality.  First time director Juan Antonio Bayona didn't do much to deviate from del Toro's established style and techniques, but it's probably best considering this was his first major film.  Either way, the del Toro/Bayona collaboration has made this film dark, brooding, and scary in a way that makes you scared to look in mirrors, but hopeful in a way that won't make the terror resonate with you TOO long after the film.  It could have used with losing a few minutes here and there, particularly in the scenes with and leading up to the medium, which--until a rather large revelation--sort of took attention away from the main plot.<br /><br />In the end, "The Orphanage" is a horror film the same way that "Pan's Labyrinth" is a dark fantasy film.  It breaks convention, both by being darker than you usually see and by letting the viewer see a bit of ironic hope at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />8/10</p></br></body></html>

The movie begins where Volume 1 left off: The Bride, now revealed as Beatrix Kiddo, played by Thurman, has just killed two of her former co-members in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad: Vernita Green, played by Vivica A. Fox, and O-Ren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu. Now, Beatrix is determined to get to the leader of them all and once she does she will kill Bill, played by Caradine, but not before she confronts the one-eyed maniac Elle Driver, played by Hannah, in the most memorable fight scene of all Kill Bill films, and Bud, played by Madsen, Bill's trailer dwelling brother. Along the way, we are finally introduced to Bill (in the first Volume, Bill is heard but not seen). We're also given Bill's motives for ordering the assault on the Texas church where The Bride, her fiance and companions were brutally massacred by the DiVAS. The sequel also explores how Kiddo, or The Bride, was trained into becoming a killing machine, and, finally, introduces us to the fate of The Bride's baby and who the father is.<br /><br />Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 have been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. As one whole movie, Kill Bill is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films of the first decade of the millennium.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Kill Bill Volume 2 is easily one of the most original stories I've ever seen. Everywhere I thought this movie was going to go....it didn't. Granted there are violent scenes, revenge filled rampaging fights and plenty of edge of your seat action. What I didn't expect was a lot of comedy. The actors never played anything for a laugh and I believe that's why it translated so well. The black and white cinematography ranks up there with some of the best ever, plus the camera movement was unreal. They used plenty of really neat pan shots. They always had the camera moving at very pleasing angles that went hand in hand with the telling of the story and at times the unfolding of the story as when the camera balances out other people or objects come into frame.<br /><br />The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride is one of the most memorable fight scenes ever, if not the best. Just really original concepts provided by the Yuen Wo Ping Fight Team who deserve some sort of award for their helping revive a rebirth in the genre let alone spawning movies such as the Matrix etc. Also deserving praise is Uma Thurman who easily gave her best performance to date. Wow is all that can be said. She was funny, vulnerable and [great action packed] all at the same time. I really see this as a female empowerment film.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino delivers an astonishing film. It's obvious he loves this genre way more then the hardcore addicts it's so welcome in today's film industry where producers call the shots. You can tell this series is his baby. This is a definitely a must have especially if you loved the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Well, after seeing the absolutely brilliant and just plain awesome Kill Bill Vol. 1, I had my hopes very high for this one. I couldn't wait for it. But, when I left the theater, I was actually dissapointed. This one isn't at all like its predecessor. While the first one had MANY absolutely awesome fighting scenes and had great humor and a great story, this didn't like that one. First off, this one was way too long, and it went too much into detail in the past and training of the Bride. That's where it kind of lost me. Sure, the scene where she fights the Nurse is great, but that's really all. I have to admit, I liked some of the story andd it was a solid movie but was just way too slow moving. Where's the awesome fight scenes? Where's the great humor? I really don't know. and then the fight against Bill just didn't deliver. It was a really average and just weird fight that wasn't like what I had expected. this was a letdown. But, it still deserves 3 and 1/2 stars for one awesome fighting, some very neat moments, and some interesting parts. Also, watch the only deleted scene. It's a really good fight where Bill kcks a**! If you liked the first one, you should rent this but probably not buy it unless you're just a plain die hard fan. This movie is above average but dissapointing and unlike the wiked # 1.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This two-parter is the best thing Tarantino has done since Pulp Fiction. My wife hated the first part last year, so I had to go to this one with some like-minded friends, and we loved it. We know now that the Bride's real name is Beatrix Kiddo (nice bit of tongue-in-cheek) and Umas Thurman long, lanky style fits the role perfectly. Michael Madsen is terrific as Bill's brother, Budd. And David Caradine is an instant classic as Bill. Again, Tarantino builds great individual scenes, including the last fight between Beatrix and Elle (Daryl Hannah), the black mamba bit, Bill's analysis of comic book superhero character-types, and the entire burial alive chapter. My friends felt a bit cheated that the showdown between the Bride and Bill wasn't a cataclysmic samurai sword scene, but I thought the rather understated Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique was a perfect, unexpected Tarantino ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>After seeing this in the theater, I left convinced that the Kill Bill saga (both 1 & 2 together) is Tarentino's best wotk.  Seeing Vol.2 on DVD just reinforced that opinion.  From the very opening with the haunting piano....it seemed like it was destined to more than the action-fest of the first installment.  We're treated to the full story of how the 'wedding massacre' went down proving that the event was far more brutal and traitorous than any of us could of imagined.<br /><br />The biggest questions of all left from vol.1 (why and why, to certain issues) are all wrapped up nicely here.  Bill, is sadistic and insane, of course; but he might not be the cold-blooded psycho we expect him to be.<br /><br />By the way....the shot of the Bride and Pai Mei doing the animal forms in synch with each other in front of the red backdrop has to be the single coolest thing I've ever seen in a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I loved Kill Bill Vol 1 and was one of the first in line to see the DVD of Kill Bill Vol 2.  I sure wasn't disappointed.  And I think that Quentin Tarantino is a genius, especially in the way the two films work together. Vol 1 was all action and not much story.  All the audience knew was that "the bride", played by Uma Thurman, who also was Tarantino's co-writer, was after revenge.  There was a lot of fighting and huge scenes where this lone woman battled hoards of assassins.  It was complete in and of itself.  And it seemed that the back-story didn't matter.<br /><br />But the back-story DID matter.  And that is what Vol 2 is about.  The audience has already gotten to know the characters and is also prepared for some incredibly horrific fighting that goes way over the top in violence.  I expected more of the same.  But that was not to be.  Instead, I was treated to a slow unfolding of a story.  The fighting was equally vile and wild, of course.  And there is one fight scene between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah that is guaranteed to make you wince.  But there were indeed fewer casualties in Vol 1 and some very tender moments too.  The characters grew in complexity, especially Bill, played by an aging David Carradine.  In this role he's the embodiment of evil, and yet his appeal is understandable.  Uma Thurman must have had to train round-the-clock to learn all the martial arts moves that this film required.  But there are some scenes in the film in which she has to use all her acting talent and show some real emotion in some incredible situations.  Her performance shines.<br /><br />If you're looking for a kind and gentle film, this is not the film for you.  But if you're looking for innovative filmmaking, unrelenting violence and complexity, you'll LOVE Kill Bill 2.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino expands his "Kill Bill" film with this movie KB Pt. II. This film answers all those questions that crept into your psyche during part one.<br /><br />While KB Pt. I was filled with unanswered questions, many fight scenes and brutal killings this film (Pt. II) is more on a psychological mission than a physical one. In a way this movie is the Western version of the East/West duo. The film still focuses upon the story of "The Bride" (Uma Thurman) and her revenge quest against those who wronged her. Most importantly in this film we finally get to meet Bill, played with interest by David Carradine. Together Thurman and Carradine take the audience on another uniquely original ride directed by Tarantino.<br /><br />KB Part II has less brutality and sadly less Kung Fu. But in this film we are able to understand the characters better and the tortures they are faced with are more psychological in origin. We meet "Bill," and the man "The Bride" intended to marry, Daryl Hannah has a significant part in the saga, Michael Madsen provides some interesting sensitivity, and finally the Kung Fu master Pai Mei (played by Chia Hui Liu) makes his debut training Thurman on to brilliance. This film is done with many black & white scenes and old western type scenes, while the music in the background sounds a little like an old spaghetti western from Italy I once saw.<br /><br />This film is less intense than Part I but more grueling psychologically. One great fight scene is not to be missed between Thurman and Hannah of course! Tarantino manages to keep the viewers interested while creating a completely different movie from Part I, but watch them both and experience something unique and interesting, with stunning visuals and great music.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>A minority of detractors have complained that KILL BILL-Vol 2 (and Vol. 1) is derivative.  However, this is Quentin Tarantino and there is a certain stamp and style to this film (and all his films). What is homage is also adding a large amount of originality to a genre.  Both volumes of KILL BILL is an amalgam of spaghetti westerns, kung fu movies,anime, and revenge flicks. The standout performance is, of course, Uma Thurman (as 'The Bride'). She is bent on revenge and wanting payback from those who "ruined" her wedding day and out to kill the man who engineered "the hit" on her: Bill (good to see David Carradine in a major movie role). This was a unique performance for Thurman showing off her acting and physical chops, and she should get a Best Actress nomination. Once again Tarantino shows his flair for crisp dialogue, drawn out scenes, and his love of pop culture, television and movies in general. When Uma Thurman as 'The Bride' gets in her 'revenge-and-kill' mode and the theme song from the tv series IRONSIDE (Raymond Burr) blares in the background, it's pure joy. It's ashame Tarantino doesn't do more movies.  However, as one film reviewer in praise of Tarantino's work states (to paraphrase), one has to remember that Tarantino is also a writer as well as a filmmaker.  He writes the films he directs. Therefore, it is a long process between film projects.  It might be a blessing because it makes his films worth waiting for. This reviewer is looking forward to Tarantino's next project.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>While waiting for the inevitable ultimate edition of this title together with Part I, in some kind of souped up "Bill Saga," this DVD transfer does just fine.  It's worth it just to see the expressions of doubt, fear, pain and triumph cross Uma Thurman's face.  The deleted scene is also worth th cost of the DVD, so there you go, it's the kind of extra I wasn't expecting with this apparent time-serving placeholder, so good for QT.  Mexican-American actors may protest QT's use of the Anglo (former) heart throb Michael Parks to play the Mexican capo, but Parks delivers a performance that outdoes his playing of a very different role in KILL BILL VOL 1.  I showed this DVD to three ftiends who had never seen part I, and none of them complained that they couldn't understand it.  It is number one, a simple story when stripped of its excrescences, and number two, hypnotic from the first majestic downbeat on the soundtrack.<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds great all the way through to the improbable and happy ending.  Of course, we have a feeling there will be trouble ahead when the little daughter of Vivica Fox grows up to brandish a weapon raised in vengeance.  Those of you who have read Cornell Woolrich's novels THE BRIDE WORE BLACK or THE BLACK ANGEL will have experienced this richness of story-telling before, but for the rest of us, KILL BILL is a novel idea, beautifully executed by a gang of pros.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>NO, not nearly as frenetic as and far more talky and philosophical than Vol. 1, but that's OK. This is a near-perfect ending to a visually amazing film. Tarrantino's tribute to several genres is heartfelt; a little over the top at times, but purely intenbtional. But I agree with some reviewers; you have to see 1 before 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Thursday, August 12, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Almost languid ending.<br /><br />Compared to the frenetic carnage of the first installation, the second has an almost languid ending to the chop-socky revenge saga.  Uma returns as the bride and continues her quest to wreak revenge on those who apparently killed her and her unborn child.  As the scenes shift between southwest spaghetti western locales and her training in the east; I was reminded that I actually preferred the first installment's Tokyo rumble and the treatment.  Granted, a second dose of the same killing would be tough to handle, it was just ... different.  More introspective and dare I say it, calm in its damage.  Uma is more precise here and not as whirlwind, tearing through 88 gangsters.  Taken together, it's an impressive homage piece and artistic statement.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>The two films cut together would have been the way to go in my opinion. Heck as one 4 hour epic it may have been noticed by the Academy Awards just for being so incredibly unique. We all know the reason Miramax films released two movies instead of one. YOUR MONEY TIMES TWO! Since I respect Miramax due to hundreds of quaility films, I'll let them stiff me this once. Quentin Tarantino is an amazing filmmaker, I love all his films. The ones he wrote and directed anyway. Some of the screenplays he wrote in the past were directed by others than himself. Which they were mostly cool flicks, but they might have been better had he made them himself. The reason I say this film isn't for everyone is because I have a part time job in a video store and I hear some people say how they just don't get into it. They say they didn't like the first Kill Bill and they aren't interested in bothering with the 2nd. I did get a customer to get both films and have a double feature. He later said it was one of the best film experiences he'd ever had. At first he wasn't interested in the series. Truthfully these two films together are an amazing piece of work and it's ashame to over look them. I'm not saying get the kids rounded up and have family movie night with Kill Bill, that's obvious. I hope people know that this isn't for children. It is great entertainment for grown ups who like deep, dark and dramatic sword swinging action with plenty of Tarantio style humor. So, watch'em together or watch'em seperate.. just watch'em!! One last thing ..Uma Thurman is in a word.. Astonishing!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>The Kill Bill series is a real masterpiece.  This review counts for both movies.  They are both very entertaining works of art.  The action is brutal and great, the story is excellent, the performances are total bad a$$, the drama is great, overall this is the greatest revenge movie ever, and is also Tarantino's best so far, i hope he continues making movies until his sad sad death. Quentin is the man.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I went to see KILL BILL VOL 1 grudgingly at the request of a friend. However, after seeing the film, I was kind of impressed and was curious to see how things would come to together in VOL 2. Well, everything fits together rather nicely and this Volume makes a nice conclusion to what began in the first.<p>The movie begins with a black and white montage with the Bride talking about what had happened in Volume 1 and about how nothing was going to stop her from her goal to kill Bill. This version is much more story and dialogue driven than the action/violence driven Volume 1. Tarantino is the kind of filmmaker that most people either love or hate. I tend to fall more on the side of hate, simply because he often over emphasizes violence. However, I do think the man is an extremely talented writer as the dialogue in his films is usually extremely witty, bright, and full of substance. Anyway, Volume 2 isn't anywhere near as violent as the first volume and focuses more instead upon character development and the relationships between the chracters. There's really only one new character introduced in this edition (Pai Mei), but he forms a crucial part of the background the Bride's story. There are a view violent scenes (especially between the Bride and Elle Driver), but overall it is dialogue and characterization that drive the picture.<p>KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is longer and a bit more slow than KILL BILL VOLUME 1. There were a few things that could have been cut to make the film a little shorter, but I guess Tarantino decided to put a little more stuff in to make up for cutting this movie into two separate parts. Other than that, KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is a fitting end to this part of the Kill Bill saga. As a sidenote, though, don't be surprised if this is the last we see of The Bride: there was a little incident from the first volume that might lead to another part of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>It's hard to say whether Volume 1 or Volume 2 is more enjoyable.  Someday in the near future, I hope to own the Complete Kill Bill Special Edition DVD collection.  Or maybe Tarantino will edit the whole thing together into one movie as it was originally planned.  Anyway, both films can stand by themselves.  True, there isn't a fight sequence in this film as monumental as The Bride fighting all of the Crazy 88's, but her fight sequence with Darryl Hannah (entitled provocatively, "Elle and I") will leave a lasting impression.<p>In the first film, we were left to infer things without getting all the information.  We never even actually "saw" Bill.  However, we formed certain expectations about him.  This film succeeds in confounding those expectations.  The film sequence turns out to be surprisingly poignant.  Of course, there is great Tarantino dialogue here as well - I didn't think anyone would come up with anything fresh to say on the subject of Superman, but he does.  All in all, this is an incredibly fun ride.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>I want to make it VERY clear, the three stars are NOT for the movie. Kill Bill, in my view, is one of the best movies ever made but this evaluation is for THIS Kill Bill Blu-ray release.<br /><br />I am totally sold on Blu and, when the Kill Bill bundle became available... well... I ordered it when Amazon offered it at a great discount. The bundle includes Kill Bill 1 and 2 and, IF you wish to upgrade your KBs I highly recommend the bundle because you could save a few dollars. There is no difference between the 2 KBs sold as individual titles and them sold together other than, possibly, the price.<br /><br />I wish I had a lot to say about the Blu-ray version but I don't so, let me say what is worth saying:<br /><br />- The contents of the Blu-ray version are EXACTLY those of the DVD edition, nothing more, nothing less.<br />- Even the artwork is borrowed from the original DVD edition.<br />- The 'extras' are shot in low resolution, in fact they are the exact extras you will find on the DVD.<br />- The resolution of the movie is, of course, higher than the DVD's and the audio is available as 'uncompressed' but nothing special was done for the Blu issue. I noticed quite a few artifacts and some graininess but, overall, the picture quality is good. It could have been a lot better. I expect a remastered edition in the near future.<br /><br />Overall, I am not very happy with this edition which appears to have been put together on the cheap and in a hurry. I suspect that the digital master used to make the DVDs was quickly converted to Blu and thrown out on the market but I could be wrong.<br /><br />I am looking forward to a complete and professionally done Tarantino filmography on Blu in the near future, meaning that I'd be buying the Kill Bills three times.<br /><br />On deciding whether to buy this release or not it should be up to one's budget. Those who don't have the DVD edition but have a Blu player, definitely buy the Blu, preferably the bundle because one never knows when a superior version may be released. If you already have the DVD... like I said, I bought my KB 1&2 package when Amazon offered it at a very significant discount.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>It's hard to say whether Volume 1 or Volume 2 is more enjoyable.

The fight scene with the Crazy 88s goes down in my memory as one of the greatest I've ever seen, and that last battle with Oren was sad and beautiful and incredibly fierce.  I wanted to love Kill Bill 2 but frankly, it just doesn't measure up. It's like Tarantino gave the best of what he had to the first movie and threw in some cold leftovers for the second.<br /><br />There is only one good fight scene in Bill 2. When Elle and the Bride get together in Bud's foul little trailer it's a doozy but the audience has to wait a long, long time for it. Here's one small nitpick. Why did Elle introduce Bud to the Black Mamba? I would've preferred to see the Bride get her rematch with him.<br /><br />Part of the problem with this moive is that the China scenes should've been shorter and part of it is that Bill is shown too early. It would've been much better we didn't get to see the snake charmer fully until the last chapter. And speaking of the last chapter I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wasn't happy with the incedibly wimpy way things went down with Bill.<br /><br />The Bride goes through hell and dishes it out to all the DIVAS and has like five seconds of fight with the Man himself. What a let down! I suspect Tarantino knew he could'nt pull off another Oren/Bride type of triumph so he did a quickie meeting with Bill but that stinks. The audience has sat and waited for this meeting and it doesn't meet expectations.<br /><br />Yes, I was happy with the ending and the clever bit of music and last shots of the actors but that final scene with Bill is so bad it destroys the movie. I bought Kill Bill 1 and its soundtrack. I will  not be doing that with Kill Bill 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I explained in my review of Kill Bill Vol 1 that I generally did not enjoy watching the first film because of its excessive style & overstuffed pop culture homages and references. Well I didn't enjoy Vol 2, either, but it's because of different reasons. The second half of Tarantino's Kill Bill has a fairly simpler style, and far less pop culture references. That's the good thing, at least for me. But unfortunately, it doesn't stop me from disliking the film. The problem I have with Vol 2 is that numerous scenes are unbelievably ponderous mostly because of excessive dialogue. I don't have anything against dialogue-driven films (All The President's Men and Glengarry Glen Ross are some of my favorites that choose words over action), but the conversations in this particular film are pretty dull and uninteresting. They drag on so long that you have no choice but just sit there and wait for the fight scenes. And speaking of fight scenes, there are only fifteen minutes of fight scenes here compared to the half hour in Vol 1. You'll be sorely disappointed if you're expecting to see Uma Thurman battle dozens of swordsmen yet again. I did like the performances: Thurman and the late David Carradine are wonderful onscreen, and the supporting cast do a great job on their own. Still, I can't say that I enjoyed watching Kill Bill Vol 2. Like Vol 1, it's not a film that I would admire, even though many others do admire it. Again, if you love this film, then that's fine by me. But in my honest opinion, I don't really like this film, so I don't care for it very much.<br /><br />Grade: C-</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>(continued from the Kill Bill 1 page)...<br /><br />Where Volume 1 was Tarantino's homage to old school martial arts films and Japanese pop and cinema culture, Volume 2 is a western.  On the surface, it's easy to think that these are two very different genres of movies but in theme that's not true.  Both deal with revenge.  How many martial arts movies and westerns have you seen where someone has been killed and must be revenged?<br /><br />The music is another connection to the styles.  In Vol 1, the music is more J-Pop and Japanese style in theme (look at the 5, 6, 7, 8s).  In Vol 2, Robert Rodriguez (director/writer of Desperado, etc) created the music (in fact, he did it for $1 with the intentions that Tarantino would direct a portion of Rodriguez's next movie for $1 which happens to be Sin City.  Make sure to catch that April 1st).  With Rodriguez's flair, the music becomes more western/mexican.<br /><br />The other connection is that a lot of Asian films are like Tarantino's in that they are non-linear (i.e. The Grudge, etc).  Vol 1 was very non-linear in it's story-telling approach.  Vol 2, being more westernized, is told in a more linear way.  Not to say it doesn't move back in time then to the present, because it does.  But, in comparison to Vol 1, vol 2 is very much more linear.  And herein lies the brilliance of this movie.  Tarantino bridges the two cultures and cinema styles, creating an epic that is part Japanese and part American old West.<br /><br />In Volume 2 we learn that everything we thought we knew is probably wrong.  By this, I'm referring to Bill.  In Vol 1 Bill is an insidious voice at the other end of the phone, one hand on his sword, moving it up and down.  We hear his raspy voice and that's about it.  He is an pitch black character.  In Vol 2, when we actually see Bill and get to know his character, Tarantino has changed our perspectives.  Yes he is evil, but not only that, he is human.  A lot more human than we are led to believe.  It's creepy and makes his character more real.<br /><br />The violence is more subdued this time than in the first one.  Where Vol 1 was a blood soaked revenge story, Vol 2 more resembles some of Tarantino's other stories.  It's filled with more awesome dialogue and more story.  Here we learn all of the answers to The Bride's past and how she got to where she was.<br /><br />There are still some awesome fight scenes.  The Bride's battle with Elle Driver is intense while strangely humorous.  My one complaint is that we have a 3 hour lead up to a very quick battle with Bill.  It's over too fast for me.  I was a bit let down.  Don't get me wrong, HOW it ends is excellent for reasons I won't spoil, but they get to that ending too fast unfortunately.  I was a bit disappointed.  But, that is a quibble in what is truly and excellent saga.  I can't say enough for this series.  It is amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>It's probably a good thing that Volume One and Volume Two of KILL BILL were never combined: there appear to be two different audiences that appreciated each one and probably would've been less enthused about one film.<br /><br />Volume One appeared to satisfy those who enjoyed fast-moving action and cartoonish bloodshed.<br /><br />Volume Two played to those who favor character and emotional development.<br /><br />I watched Volume Two even though I thought Volume One was thin and overrated.  And, no matter how good Two may be, it still has to take its story and characters from One.  Two makes a valiant effort, helped primarily by outstanding performances from Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and David Carradine, but it ends up trying to develop a deeper film from essentially a kung-fu parody.  (The tinny dramatic chords from 70's chop-socky movies reminds you of that throughout Two).<br /><br />Still, the lightest Tarantino fair is still more interesting than most movies out today.<br /><br />After reading this week that Tarantino plans to combine the films and rerelease them, I just hope he doesn't make more of KILL BILL than there really is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>If you have seen vol.1 and aren't going to watch  vol.2 because you think it is more of the same, you will be pleasantly surprised with a diologue rich, fraction of the violence, well completed story of revenge. So if you have made it through vol.1, treat yourself to vol.2 you will be glad you did!</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>Tarantino is famous for his unpredictability.<br /><br />After the violence-heavy "Reservoir Dogs", came the plot-heavy "Pulp Fiction", then the character-driven (and, in my opinion, best-to-that-date movie) "Jackie Brown".<br /><br />Why, then, has it been such a shock to so many people that "Kill Bill Vol. 2" has not followed the same template as the excellent original?<br /><br />Picking up where we left off, The Bride is en-route to actually kill the titular Bill, and fills us in on the events up to that point. Gone is the yellow pleather, gone too are the Manga cutscenes, the Japanese hedonism, the bustling metropolitan cityscapes and the sense of mystery that the original movie had in spades.<br /><br />But replacing those things are some truly seminal Tarantino moments, like his glorious homage to the characters of  spaghetti-western, a magnificently-concieved Chinese Master, a truly grim buried-alive sequence, and all the missing pieces to the puzzle of "Kill Bill Vol. 1".<br /><br />Performance-wise, Thurman as The Bride is back on top form, and is edgy and cool as the woman who is out to reclaim her life. Michael Madsen gives a star turn as prodigal assassin Budd, his laziness and viciousness contrasting beautifully. Daryl Hannah is a joy as the disengaged, violent Elle Driver (her demise is a scene that will go down in Tarantino history as legend) and David Carradine is perfect as the eponymous Bill.<br /><br />Direction is Classic Tarantino. Whereas Volume 1 relied (some might say a little too heavily) on the "Quirky" factor, here most of the movie is shot in the desert, and Tarantino's artistry with a camera, as well as the talents of his perfect ensemble cast, are allowed to shine through, ggimmick-free. The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride in Budd's trailer is amazing, as is the flashback sequence in rural China.<br /><br />All in all, this truly is a Sequel that is an Equal, and in many ways, outstrips the original in terms of directorial mastery and wonderful performance.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Part of the reason why i didn't like this movie was Bill's boring monologue at the end, but I did like very much the part with Pai Mei, it explained a lot about how she learned her assassin skills. I'm not sure how to feel about what she did to Bill, but this is overall a good movie when watched with Vol. 1.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>Several months ago, eclectic director Quentin Tarantino regaled our senses with a visceral thrill-ride known as "Kill Bill: Volume 1".  This first half of Tarantino's epic tale of revenge introduced to the enigmatic former assassin known as the Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) and the circumstances that led her to embark on a quest to `kill Bill'.  Mamba miraculously survived an assassination by Bill and his current hit squad (although her entire wedding party was murdered), only to end up in a coma for four years.  Once she regained consciousness, she began to exact brutal vengeance on those responsible.<br /><br />In "Vol. 1" she took out Vernita Green/"Copperhead" (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii/"Cottenmouth" (Lucy Liu).  The revenge was purely physical and graphically brutal.  It was a veritable assault of visual images and thrilled the audience with the completeness and thoroughness of Mamba's revenge.  Fascinatingly, "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is a drastically different film even though it continues the same story.  "Vol. 2" takes a more philosophical approach to Mamba's revenge, whereas "Vol. 1" was the more physical approach.  While more talkative possessing less action, "Vol. 2" is no less effective than "Vol. 1".  What "Vol. 2" brings is the rest of the story that "Vol. 1" rightfully left out.  In this concluding episode, we now know more about the history between Bill and Mamba.  We learn more about why Bill ordered Mamba's assassination.  As an added bonus, after seeing a steely-eyed killing machine in "Vol. 1", we get to see a more vulnerable Mamba in this installment.  The combination of the two volumes completes this story.  One is the yin to the other's yang.  The choice to split the film into two parts now not only seems correct, but essential.<br /><br />Doubts about Tarantino still having `it' should be full dispelled by this incredible cinematic achievement.  "Kill Bill" honors martial-arts films of the past while setting a standard for future films to emulate.  "Kill Bill" manages to thrill the senses while challenging the mind.  Tarantino showed that he had this talent when he made "Pulp Fiction".  "Kill Bill" is the next step in the evolution of Tarantino's work.  Where he goes from here is anyone's guess, but it has the potential to be spectacular.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Kill Bill Vol. 2' concludes Quentin Tarantino's revenge saga of a femme fatale assasin that seeks revenge on those that attempted to murder when she sought her own life. Like the first volume, the story is told through chapters that alternate between flashbacks and the present action.<br /><br />Uma Thurman plays the Bride, who was nearly murdered at her own wedding by her former boss, Bill, and her the rest of the members of the Deadly Viper Assasin Squad (I think I got that right). In part one, she awoke after a four year coma to take revenge on two of the lady assasins played by Lucy Liu and Vivica Fox. Now she is after Sidewinder, played by a Tarantine regular Michael Madsen, the California Mountain Snake, played by Daryl Hannah, and Bill himself, played by Kung-Fu's David Carradine.<br /><br />Where volume one was nearly all action as the Bride took her revenge on two of her former associates while subtly setting up the plot, volume two tones down the action while telling the rest of the story. Tarantino talks about this quite a lot in the DVD featurette. The trademark Tarantino dialogue is featured in key scenes between Marsden and Carradine (talking about revenge and the past) and between Carradine and Thurman (talking about comic book heros and the self we present to others). There are a few writers that have such a distinctive style for dialogue, and Tarantino's is truly unique.<br /><br />Despite the reduction in action, this is still a great film. If you have an afternoon to spare, I recommend watching both volume one and two consecutively, and then watch the featurettes that talk about the films. Or, watch the films at your leisure, then watch the featurettes and then watch the films again. There is a lot to these films, and some of it is very subtle. Listening to Tarantino and the cast talk about the films opens new ways of looking at them.<br /><br />Also on the DVD is a commentary, a live performance from the premiere, and a deleted scene. The deleted scene is an homage of sort to old kung-fu and karate movies. It is very over the top, and really had little to do with the rest of the movie. While the film itself lacks the geysers of blood from the first movie, this deleted scene has a few of its own. Watch it at your own risk. While on the subject of gore, there is still plenty of it in this movie. The squeemish will wince in a few places, but the blood is significantly less than the first volume.<br /><br />This film is part kung-fu movie, part old spaghetti Western, and all revenge flick. Tarantino fans will be delighted. Those that liked 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs' should also like this film. Throw this movie in the DVD player the next chance you get, but tuck the kids in first.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>In a telling moment of "Kill Bill Volume 2" Bill's brother, Budd, played in a wonderful understated performance by Michael Madsen, is listening to a recounting of events we saw in Volume 1 - specifically when Uma Thuman's Bride single-handedly destroy Lucy Liu's O-Ren Shii and her bodyguard platoon, the "Crazy 88".<br /><br />Budd asks "You're telling me she cut through eighty-eight bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?"<br /><br />Brother Bill replies "Nah, there weren't really eighty-eight of them. They just called themselves "The Crazy 88."<br /><br />Budd asks "How come?"<br /><br />Bill answers "I don't know. I guess they thought it sounded cool."<br /><br />There is a LOT in Quentin Tarantino movies that happens because it looks or sounds cool.  I'm reminded in "Pulp Fiction" of the dialogue-less scene in the Pawn shop where Bruce Willis is upstairs selecting a weapon to use on the psychotic murdering rapists downstairs.  He considers a few lethal clubs and even a chain-saw before settling on the Samurai sword and in the audience I was thinking "YEAH! Get the samurai sword! That'll get 'em!" Plus - it's cool.<br /><br />There is a scene where one of the characters sicks a deadly Black Mamba on another character, then whips out a notebook with pages of hand-written notes about how god-awful deadly the Black Mamba is. The character sits down, flips open the notebook, and delivers an almost pharmacologic description of the lethal venom, along with "'In the bush,' the saying goes, 'a lion can kill you, a leopard can kill you, and the black mamba can kill you. However, only with the mamba is death certain.' Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate.'" Pretty cool, huh?"<br /><br />Tarantino's movies are cool, and the characters in them know it. The smallest touches are added, sometimes for no apparent reason other than to add a "cool" factor.  All of the members of Bill's Assassination team are called the "Deadly Viper Assassination Squad" and they all have "Snake" Code-names.  Why?  'Cuz it's cool, of course.<br /><br />In the beginning, at the wedding rehearsal of the bride, we get to see Samuel Jackson portraying the piano player for the wedding, and is there anyone cooler than Mr. Jackson in the movies?  He asserts his coolness by telling how he sat in with practically every R&B group that came through his little town over 2 decades.<br /><br />The Bride is standing at the alter of her wedding rehearsal when she hears a flute playing a familiar refrain.  She follows the notes outside where she finds her old boss and lover, Bill, playing the familiar notes on his old flute.  Bill is played by David Carradine, and if movies gave out "comeback of the year" awards like sports does, Mr. Carradine would have earned it in this role, courtesy of Mr. Tarantino.  For extra "coolness", the flute that Bill is playing for the Bride is the same one that Carradine played back 30 years ago in his iconic role as Caine in the wildly popular tv series "Kung Fu".<br /><br />The "Wedding Chapel Massacre" that we're told about in a roundabout way in Volume 1 is set up perfectly in Volume 2, then executed with a single swooping crane shot that backs from the wedding party at the altar, all the way back through the church, down the steps, straight back through the gravel parking lot where the other members of the Assassination Squad are approaching with cool strides and lethal weapons.  The crane swoops the camera up overhead and we see the flashes in the church and hear the shots and screams - and we KNOW what is happening in there without being shown in gory detail.  I can think of no single camera shot as virtuoso since Orson Welles' virtuoso opening to "Touch of Evil".<br /><br />I haven't told you ANYTHING about the plot, but if you watched Volume 1 you KNOW where the plot is going.  There's a surprise or two, but there's delight in every scene.  I've read Roger Ebert say that movies aren't as important in "what they're about" as in "how they're about it".<br /><br />Kill Bill is about Kung-Fu movies and westerns, and the way it's about it is..... cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>This movie does not have all the action in it but it does have some which is great plus if there was more fight scenes the movie wouldn't have made much sense so they did a great job by adding more story to this great movie.

We get to know The Bride's real name, plus we get to see Bill for the first time! There's a lot of suspense, like when one of Bill's henchman burys The Bride alive!<br /><br /> This is an epic trioligy. Add it to your DVD collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>A comment crucial to understanding this film is made by David Carradine in the 'making of' documentary included with this DVD: 'Tarantino's movies have never been about the violence or action; they are about the minds and hearts of violent people.'<br /><br />In Volume 2, the focus on character and motivation is stronger than ever, and the Bride's final showdown with Bill - more conversation than combat - is as engaging a scene, emotionally, as the movie's other setpiece, her battle with Elle, is engaging viscerally.<br /><br />But those who say that Volume Two is 'better' than Volume One because of its slower pace and exposition fail to appreciate the entire film. Volume Two is a counterpoint to - and a fulfilment of - ideas created in Voume One.<br /><br />What may be the best evidence of Kill Bill's artistic value is that the Bride's five opponents do not just differ in their strength and combat gimmicks, allowing for more and more elaborate fight scenes; but in their motivations, their attitude toward violence, toward their own happiness and, ultimately, toward their own deaths. Each of them represents a philosophy. Vernita Green is the repentant killer; O-Ren is the megalomaniacal, Caligula-esque nihilist; Budd is a fatalistic, quiet nihilist; Elle is ambitious, cruel and spiteful. Bill is the ultimate philosophy of violence, violence for the sake of violence. The Bride was offered an escape from this world in the form of her child, which she lost, plunging her back into the cycle of death; but of course, as we know at the end of Volume One, her child is still alive.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the DVD, which is fairly sparse on features. Am I the only one who sees a 'special two-disc deluxe edition' coming out in the next few years?</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>"Kill Bill volume 1" was a thrilling, intense, stylized, gory bloodbath with occasional poignant moments of character development and backstory. We saw the Bride in full-on revenge mode, hacking to pieces anyone who got in the way of her killing the assassins that turned her wedding rehearsal into a massacre. What we have with "Kill Bill volume 2" is actually a perfect yin to volume 1's yang: A poignant, character-driven, dialogue-heavy story with occasional moments of intense, stylized violence. In Volume 2, the focus is on the Bride's complex relationship with Bill, who was her mentor, lover, father figure and would-be killer. We come to understand the reasons why the Bride left the DiVAS to marry a record store owner, and what drove Bill to murder his former lover and protege. As with the last film, Uma Thurman handles every scene and scenario with incredible skill, poise and understated brilliance. David Carradine also gives a terrific performance as the charismatically evil Bill. Props to Tarantino for not just splitting one film in two, but actually creating two distinctly different films that complement and complete each other.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>"Kill Bill Volume 2" is (obviously) the second part of the Kill Bill Saga. Uma Thurman is down two villains with three to go, and her journeys take her from the Mojave desert to Latin America. However, I must point out that you can watch Volume 2 and still have a grasp of what's going on. This is because the opening of the movie takes time to show you what happened at El Paso with Uma Thurman's wedding and later on explains how a group of white Americans came to be experts with samurai swords.<p>In this round Quentin Tarantino still finds time to spoof the films he loves. While he spoofed samurai films in Volume 1, he finds time to spoof Kung Fu films in this round with Pai Mei, the aging old Chinese man in the mountains with unlimited knowledge of Kung Fu. This sequence is a MAJOR satire of the old chop suey films of the 1970's, complete with corny lines ("From here you have a good view of my foot!") and unnecessary (and gratuitous) close-ups. For further reference, I suggest you go out and rent the Wu Tang films. I recommend "Ho's, Thugs, and Scrillah" and "Mystery of Chess Boxing."<p>Now amazingly, even though there is good action here, it has been some what replaced with what made Quentin Tarantino great in his earlier films: speculative dialogue. The character of Bill is a likeable character because Tarantino has given him an actual personality as opposed to simply having him be the one that killed off Uma's friends and family. Remember the Madonna's "Like a Virgin" speech from "Reservoir Dogs"? Well, you will never see Superman the same way again after watching this movie.<p>So if you've seen the first movie, watch this one. In fact, even if you haven't, watch this movie. It's well worth your time. If any thing, see it to watch the ultimate catfight ever filmed - the Uma Thurman/Darryl Hannah fight. And believe me, Hannah gets her just deserves. I ain't gonna ruin it for you, watch the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Focusing less on the bloody mayhem of Vol. 1 and more on his typical brand of storytelling and dialogue, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 2 brings his epic homage to a close.  Picking up where the first film left off, Vol. 2 finds the Bride (Uma Thurman) continuing her quest for revenge as she hunts down Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Darryl Hannah) in America before finally taking on Bill (David Carradine).  The Bride's past is fleshed out and we learn what led up to the massacre at the wedding chapel which left our heroine in a coma and with a thirst for vengeance.  Thurman is still perfect in the role she was born to play, and Carradine gives his best performance in years.  Still though, you can tell this was a film that Tarantino made more for himself than for the movie going audience.  It's still his homage to grindhouse cinema, and it's still as fresh as Volume 1. (...)</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>The second half of Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" saga follows the continued journey of Uma Thurman's "The Bride" on her revenge mission against her former employer as well as the remaining members of her former hit squad. It's been more than a half-year between the two films and even though, the first volume was released on video the Tuesday before the second's premiere, that is still a lot of time to pass. One might liken it to the television cliffhangers but with both VHS and summer re-runs, it is far easier to stay up to date between the time. Here is where "Volume Two" suffers.<p>"Volume Two" opens with Uma's Bride on her way to finish off her boss, Bill. Before she gets there however we flash back to where it all happened: a bloody slaughter at a chappel in Texas. From there, she continues on her hit list to Bill's alchoholic brother, Budd (Michael Madsen) and her subsequent replacement, Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah). Her battle with Driver is one of the most disgusting, exciting, and violent fights ever captured on film. This all leads to a showdown with Bill. David Carradine gives a top-notch performance. A character who was more or less confined to a "villian in the shadows" in the first film really finds his voice in this one. Perhaps the most entertaining scenes in the film revolve around The Bride training with a martial arts master named Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). Michael Parks, also gives a solid performance, showing up again, doing his Heston in "Touch Of Evil" as one of Bill's father figures, a Columbian pimp.  <p>As promised, "Volume Two" puts more of an emphasis on Tarantino's trademark dialouge. There is still plenty of action going on but those who complained about the lack of hip conversation in "Volume One" may find this one more to your liking. A scene in which Bill speaks about his favorite superheroes is particulary cool and smacks of classic Tarantino. The second film is just as unapologeticly violent though at times, it is far less cartoonish about it. There are several scenes that involve torture and violent humiliation but it's all done in a somewhat tounge-in-cheek manner.<p>The biggest problem with the overall product is the splitting of the film. It seems that both volumes are missing key ingredients from the other. While "Volume 2" is a quality piece in itself, it doesn't seem to stand well on its own. People who didn't see "Volume 1", may have little to no interest in seeing the second half. While I suppose it could work on its own, the interest by this demographic doesn't look too promising. Miramax comes out the real winner though as they stand to make three times as much money on splitting the movie into two halves. Artistically, the film suffers somewhat because of it but in the end of the day, money talks. "Volume 2" will entertain anyone who loved the first but it's not gonna win over any new viewers. It's good old-fashioned violent fun at its worst.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Kill Bill, Volume 2&quot; picks up where Vol. 1 left off.

KB2 is a richly textured film in which every element--music, cinematography, costumes, etc.--unites to create a total cinematic experience.  <p>The film's superb cast delivers some real powerhouse performances.  Darryl Hannah brings an icy fury to her role as a vicious one-eyed assassin.  Michael Madsen invests his character with a world-weary, working class quality that nicely complements some of the other outrageous characters.

But make no mistake: it's Uma Thurman whose performance gives &quot;Bill&quot; it's biggest bang.  It's a powerful, multifaceted portrayal that's full of muscle, sweat, and emotional force.<p>The intelligent, clever script makes intriguing references to superhero mythology.

Therefore, I will rate it as a whole. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the dialogue, said to be Tarentino's strongest point, is snappy. Lucy Liu ("Charlie's Angels," "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle", etc), Vivica A. Fox ("Independence Day," "Two Can Play That Game), Daryl Hannah ("A Walk To Remember," "Silver City", etc), Michael Madsen and David Carradine play the DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) of whom The Bride (aka Black Mamba) (Uma Thurman, in a knockout role) was once queen bee and whom Bill (Carradine, scary as hell) has ordered to be executed at her wedding...really. She wakes up four years later, plotting bloody revenge...and she gets it: "A roaring rampage of revenge. I roared, I rampaged and I got bloody satisfaction." This movie is one of the best films that feature chicks kicking a-- and a whole lot of action. Special features include a performance by the 5, 6, 7, 8's (who appear in the film), a deleted scene (without Tarantino's commentary, for some reason) and more. The DTS 5.1 Surround Sound lets you get the full impact of this martial-arts homage. The mix of blaxploitation tracks (which includes a track from "Zamfir: Master Of The Pan Flute") and Robert Rodriguez' (the "SPY KIDS" movies) own score is awesome. Rated PG-13 for bloody violence, language and brief drug use.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>Bill's Quotes: Superman's costume is not superman it's Clarke Kent. His other personality is Clark Kent, He was born Superman." What Bill(David Carradine) is trying to explain is that Uma's character was born as the Black Mamba, her alter ego is "The Bride." SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Quentin once again proves that he is a master film maker and he is God in Hollywood. What he try's to do is show who these characters are. You learn to like Bill inspite of yourself, we know he's a horrible person, we know he's a killer, his talent is killing, but we do know he obviously loves her. He did a horrible act out of love for her.<br /><br />Chris Rock's Quote: "Have you ever loved somebody so much that sometimes you want to kill them." That quote sort of makes sense in this film. This is a Quentin Tarantino love story. Some people feel sorry for Bill because he loves her. Not that people will kill in the name of love, but some have. Now all of a sudden Uma Thurman is the bad guy for at least a little while, but you feel sympathetic to her aim as well. She wants revenge, because he did wrong by her, she feels betrayed, like he cheated her in some way, cheated her by taking the idea of a normal life for her and her baby.<br /><br />I don't like Bill, but I do understand why he did what he did, and I understand why the Bride feels so angry. And with there last words, Bill Quotes: I love you Kiddo. The Bride Quotes: I love you to. In my opinion, this is one of the craziest and one of the best love story's ever created.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>Pretty early on, it's quite clear you're watching something great, but about 3/4ths into the infinitely better second leg of Kill Bill, there's a moment that will have your jaw hitting the floor. David Carradine's rugged Bill pulls out a huge butcher knife in front of The Bride and their daughter, wields it with all of his haunting intensity, brings it down with lethal precision...<p>  ...and makes a sandwich.<p> That's right. Quentin Tarantino, the hyper mastermind behind Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, has the honor of creating the best sandwich-making scene in the history of film. Bill plunges the knife into the mayonnaise, lays the meat down piece by piece, and delivers an important monologue in a comically domestic setting that will have you drooling. And I'm not joking. But that's what sets Kill Bill Volume 2 apart from most movies being made today, and nearly everything else in Tarantino's oeuvre. Tarantino knows the importance of, to quote Vincent Vega, "the little things," and the little things include his intricate, often-funny dialogue (somewhat missing from the first installment) that shines nearly as bright as Pulp Fiction. It's back with a vengeance here.<br /><br /> Even though the movie isn't as violent and has more of Tarantino's legendary chit-chat, it still hops through genre hoops like his best work. The beginning of the film, guided by Uma Thurman's sassy narration, goes back to the infamous wedding chapel where the massacre that started it all occurred. What is so interesting about the scene, though, is how normal everything seems...yet there's a seething undercurrent of tension and suspense to it all. You can feel it during the light banter at The Bride's (I won't reveal her actual name - you have to see the movie for that) rehearsal, a tense conversation between her and Bill, and then in the moments after. <p> At first, the movie evokes a Western (Quentin even nods his head to John Ford with a Searchers-inspired shot through the frame of a door). Then the movie switches gears and conjures up that deadly femme-fatale suspense thriller vibe as The Bride gets closer to Bud (Michael Madsen). Then...wait. A flashback, and it's a campy '70' ninja homage as we see The Bride's tutelage under the fierce Pai Mei. This exciting movie never knows when to sit still, and that's what's so great about it. Tarantino, as usual, is punch-drunk with his love for the movies and as often as Bill can wow with dialogue, it's still difficult to top a great catfight.<br /><br /> At 44, Daryl Hannah is sexier than ever (yes, even Splash) as Elle Driver, and seeing her in an ultra-violent knock-down-drag-out catfight with the equally sexy Uma Thurman has to be the ultimate Tarantino geek fantasy fulfilled (count me in!). I won't divulge specifics of their brawl (which reportedly took 3 weeks to shoot), but it's one of many applause-worthy moments of the movie. Driver could be the most vicious and scary villains of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and damn is she cool. Much like Travolta in Pulp Fiction, her stint in Bill should be enough to rescucitate a career that hasn't been going so well lately. I can just see that freak, Tarantino, sitting in his home watching the stupid remake of Rear Window, Hannah's forgettable roles in Grumpy Old Men and Wall Street, and saying, "There is one dead-sexy, scary chick underneath all that." The Bride and Driver have one of the most electrifying scenes in the movie, and unlike tripe like the Matrix sequels, Tarantino and editor Sally Menke know when to cut, move on, and - best of all - create a final standoff between the two ladies that will have you peeing your pants.<p> And all of that is great stuff. But, remarkably, what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 better than its limb-chopping predecessor is the movie's final act, where everything comes together and Tarantino's true theme of the movie - motherhood - comes to full fruition. The movie, at the most perfect points, has the ability to surprise you, and the biggest surprise of them all is that Bill has its most suspenseful, powerful, and shockingly brilliant moments in the rather quiet final section. <p> I've seen Tarantino outdo himself before (the climax of Jackie Brown, Michael Madsen's vicious dismember-fest in Reservoir Dogs), but what he does with this seemingly simple tale of revenge simply goes beyond explanation. I can explain part of it: David Carradine. The dude just exudes 'cool' with every scratchy syllable, every squinty look, and every confident step. I heard that Tarantino originally wanted Warren Beatty, and I am sure-as-hell glad that fell through, for a Supporting Actor Oscar should be in the works now. And let me not forget Uma. She seemed more a killin' machine in 1, but she's best as a conflicted mother in 2, and some of the best work of her career rests in the film's climactic scene that will shock you not because it's violent (it's not), but because it's perfect. Tarantino's dialogue drives the point of the movie home with expert precision, and you might even feel a little choked up. Choked up? In the crying sense? In a Tarantino movie? I told you he'd surprise you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The Bride is back, and badder than ever. The second half of Quentin Tarantino's sprawling revenge epic &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is perhaps even better than the first, with twists, turns and more complications. Less action, more sizzling dialogue, and stuff that Part 1 only hinted at. <p>In part one of &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; the pregnant Bride (Uma Thurman) witnessed the slaughter of her fiancee, the guests at her wedding, and was shot in the head and left in a coma. Now, the Bride has killed O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). She has yet to check off two remaining names: cold-blooded Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) and Bill himself (David Carradine).<p>The Bride also has to contend with Bill's not-as-sloppy-as-he-looks brother Budd (Michael Madsen), and continues working her way up the list until she gets to Bill himself, with the intent of getting revenge. But a monkey wrench is thrown into the Bride's revenge plans when she learns the truth: The baby she was pregnant with is alive.<p>Having established the sumptuously gory backdrop of Part 1, Tarantino concerns himself a little more with story in Part 2. There's more exposition on the DIVAS  (Gordon Liu appears as Pei Mei, with silky white hair and beard straight out of a shampoo commercial), and greater fleshing out of the characters like Bill. He's no longer a faceless monster, but someone you can almost like. The story itself has become more complex.<p>The psychedelic feel of this movie is undeniable. It's almost like a parallel world where people can saunter into planes with katanas. (Try that with airline security measures!) As in Part 1, there are some wonderful fight scenes. Just don't expect Uma to rush around beheading dozens of people with big geysers of blood -- instead there's the harrowing duel with Elle. <p>Tarantino's directorial experiments pay off, playing around with camera angles, graininess and color. His dialogue is sharp as the Bride's sword. Unfortunately, he seems a little too interested in Bill, whose scenes linger a little too long. However, Carradine and Thurman are both rock-solid in virtually every scene they are in. Hannah and Liu are fun to watch too.<p>This deliciously geeky mishmash is a western/kung-fu revenge saga set in a parallel universe (Tarantinoland?). &quot;Kill Bill Volume 2&quot; surpasses the first half of this sprawling story. Stylish and freakish and not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>Apologies to those who are only interested in book report summaries of the plot and judgements on the acting. I'm not that guy and you can find storyboard summaries in probably most of the other reviews.  I am only focused on the quality of the DVD transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />I have both volumes on Standard Def DVDs and have recently bought the Blu Ray versions.  As with vol 1, there is little difference between the Standard Def versions and Blu Ray transfers.  The audio on the Standard version is a highly recommended DTS 5.1.  That's no slouch in the audio dept.  However, the Blu Ray version is uncompressed PCM audio, which, with proper audio editing can make a big difference.  Unfortunately, not with this transfer.  The front sound stage is very nicely used with a beautiful spread of the instrumentation of the score across the stage.  The rear channels are rarely used which is sad.<br /><br />While the video transfer on Blu Ray is better than it was for Vol 1, there is still some grain noticeable.  This is especially so when Bill drops off Uma at Mei Pei's retreat.  You can see the grain in the cement and a close up of Mei Pei's hair from the rear is soft and unfocused.  Perhaps this was deliberate, I don't know.  The improvement over Vol 1 is noticeable in the color saturation which is not as muted as with the blu ray version of Vol 1.<br /><br />I enjoy both these films from time to time and think they are great movies.  However, to update your standard def version to blu ray will have limited rewards if your expectations of greater quality need to be met.  The extras are the exact same as with the standard def versions; a making of, trailers and one deleted scene.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful in determining for yourself whether it is worth the purchase. If so, hit that 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right track.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>If you managed to sit through the ok-ish part one, then your reward starts right here.<br /><br />This is just like Volume 1, but amped up about ten times over. For starters, the storyline is more convincing, detailed and interesting. The Bride (Uma Thurman) has more to do than just kill lots and lots of people.<br /><br />And because of that, there is also more, and better, character development. The characters were one of the better elements of part 1, and of course, all the survivors are back for this volume, but with more depth.<br /><br />Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and Uma are all fantastic as their respective characters, truly making you believe in their twisted, violent world.<br /><br />David Carridine is brilliant as the titular Bill. His performance makes you sympathetic to Bill, despite you knowing that he is the baddie, and an exceptionally cruel person. But we still love him! A fantastic character played to perfection.<br /><br />There's also less action than part 1 and all the more better for it. Part 1's overblown, cartoony action is replaced with shorter, but more gritty, realistic and violent set pieces. Check out the trailer fight between Uma nd Darryl Hannah. Superb.<br /><br />A shout should also go out for Robert Rodriguez's music. Allegedly, he composed the film for only $1, and if so, Tarantino certainly got his moneys worth!<br /><br />Tarantino's direction also shines more clearly here, with the scene where The Bride is buried alive particularly springing to mind. Horrifying, chilling, yet stylishly done.<br /><br />In fact, the one thing that really drags this film down a bit is the tutorial scenes with Pei Mei. Slightly dull, a bit too long, it takes you away from the real crux of the story at a crucial point.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a fine film that deserves to be watched, even if you do have to sit through part 1 first. You will be glad you did.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>Probably Tarantino's best story. Kill Bill.

I don't think there's any grainy parts at all; it's completely crisp and clear.<br />*Great sound quality.  Sounds clearer and more balanced than previous DVD release.<br />*Includes a 26-minute making-of featurette, a deleted scene, and a musical performance.  It's not a whole lot of features (in fact, the same as from the DVD), but at least it has something.<br />*Some good action and fighting.<br />*Some good visuals. Still a smooth and clear picture.<br />*Still a good story, with a very good conclusion. Also fills in lots of gaps from the first film.<br />*Still an excellent group of characters that you can relate to. It is especially interesting to see Bill for the first time, among other things.<br />*Dialogue is strong and interesting.<br />*More interesting music.<br />*Lots of homage to westerns, kung fu, and anime. These elements are blended together to make a very unique picture.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*It's not the "Wholy Bloody Affair" edition.<br />*It's longer and there's much less action.<br />*Still has some absurd, unrealistic parts (but this can be a good thing, because it makes the film stylish and fun).<br /><br />This is a definite must-see for anybody who has seen the first film. All of the missing story elements are present, and brings everything into clarity. The conclusion is excellent (even if there is no fighting). I don't think this is as stylish or exciting as the first film, but it is definately worthwhile to see the complete story.<br /><br />Whether or not it is worthy of replacing the DVD is entirely up to you.  I liked the movie enough to go for it, and at the very least, I am pleased with the picture/sound quality.  I'll still want to grab the "Whole Bloody Affair" edition (you know, unrated director's cut with shedloads of special features and other crud) whenever it comes out, but considering that it never existed in the first place, I am not one to complain.  Heck, I might even keep this copy, so I have the theatrical cut.  Altogether, I don't agree with the others who complain.  It's still a good movie, and it's of good quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I loved the movie KILL BILL VOLUME 1. I thought it was not only a great tribute to the films that director Quentin Tarantino loved seeing in those grind houses long ago, but a fantastic action film in its own right. And now the final chapter in the story (so far), the second film reaches screens around the world. And...it is different.<br /><br />Suffice to say that if you walk into this film expecting the first, you will be terribly disappointed. The gore fest bloodshed has toned down, the massive amounts of swordplay, gone. Instead we find a more philosophical Tarantino film, a movie more about wordplay than swordplay. And while taken aback by it at first, I found that the more I thought about it the better it was.<br /><br />Having finished off the first two targets on her list, The Bride (as Uma Thurman's character is known so far) sets out to finish the job she started. The film opens with her making this statement and then flashing back in this chapter to what brought it all about, the massacre that we witnessed in the first film and why it came to be.<br /><br />We discover that she was the love of Bill's (David Carradine) life and that he was torn apart by her leaving him. So much so that he made the decision that if he couldn't have her no one could. He refused to let her leave the ranks of the assassination squad he had formed. At least we think this for now.<br /><br />With each chapter we are given more information as we discover who it was that trained the Bride. It was Bill's former master, Wei Ping (Gordon Liu). He takes on the task of training the Bride, something that comes in handy later on when she finds herself buried alive by Bud (Michael Madsen) after she attacks him.<br /><br />Bud, who we discover is Bill's brother, is down on his luck, working as a bouncer in a low class strip joint in El Paso. Having spoken with Bill already, he is waiting for Uma. Thinking he has done her in, he contacts Elle (Daryl Hannah) to sell of her sword. But Elle has different plans for Bud. And Uma has plans for her.<br /><br />A face off between Elle (Daryl Hannah) and the bride occurs in Bud's trailer. The swords fly and the movements are swift while confined to the small space of the trailer. But a winner emerges. By death? We are left to figure that out on our own.<br /><br />And finally, Uma heads out for a contact that will put her in touch with Bill. The final confrontation, begun with the release of the first film, unfolds. Not only that, but the surprise that Bill has in store for Uma as well. And as the surprises are revealed, conversation between these two combatants unfold the entire story that we have only been given portions of to date.<br /><br />Tarantino took much flack with the first film in that the dialogue that he is noted for was kept to a minimum while the action took the forefront. Critics blasted him for this. He has stated that the film wasn't complete with that one and keeping that in mind while watching makes the film a better experience for the viewer. When he finished, he realized that he could not release the entire picture without it being a 4 hour opus. Instead, he cut it in two and released the stories separately making them unite as a whole.  Keep this in mind while watching and it makes a difference.<br /><br />The acting in this film is wonderful, especially from David Carradine. Though never quite a fan of his, he does a great job here as Bill, offering his philosophies on life and love and the results of the same. Michael Madsen is underused but does a great job with what little time he has onscreen. And Hannah makes one of the meanest villains on screen in some time.<br /><br />But the role of the Bride (whose name is revealed finally....but don't expect me to give it here) as played by Thurman is what makes this film. It is not only the emotions that she must convey, but the physical aspects of it and delivery of dialogue in a way that makes it all believable. And Thurman does each one of these with an ease never seen before.<br /><br />KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is a good movie and an entertaining experience. See part one on DVD before watching this though and take it in as a whole film. Those who do will find more rewards than those who see it as two different films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>And I loved it. It was an excellent conclusion to this now standing duology. I admit though, it didn't have any blood-spurting action scenes like the previous film did, but for what action there was, it was fantastic. This is for sure the best recent movie dealing with the martial arts. I absolutely loved it and it rekindled my fanaticism with David Carridine who I have been a fan of since I watched him on Kung Fu: The Legend Contiues in the 90's as well as the original series on repeats. Everyone chosen in this film fit their character perfectly. A lot of surprises that are untold are unveiled in this movie and you find yourself going, "oh cool", over and over again. Like I said, it didn't have all the action that the first movie had, but what it did have was an excellent story line. Very, very well written. I loved Pai, the one who trained "The Bride". Every character is very realistic and I just can't get passed how awesome this and it's prequel is. Tarantino really has set a new standard for martial arts movies that very few will every come close to accomplishing if they ever do. Tarantino is the genious of Hollywood and I am looking forward to his future films very much. Especially looking forward to Kill Bill Volume 3 in 10 to 15 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of the first movie, the second was different in style, still good, but for me, fell a little flat. The first movie was more artistic and so good at building up tension, and the second resolves everything, answers all the questions, reveals motivations and character. But maybe tying up loose ends is the way it's done in all the movies that Tarantino is parodying. Bill's reputation definitely preceeded and inflated him; he was even a bit boring - unusual for a Tarantino character. But this movie, like the first, is lots of fun amid murder and mayhem.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Unlike its predecessor, "Kill Bill, Vol. 1," which was basically a triumph of style over substance, the follow-up, "Kill Bill, Vol. 2" is a triumph of both style AND substance - a no-holds-barred action film that turns into a thinking man`s thriller in its climactic scene.  This installment picks up where the earlier one left off, with Beatrix Kiddo, the former assassin attempting to go straight, still seeking revenge against the people who killed her fiance and friends, and left her for dead on the eve of her wedding.  Beatrix, an expert at swordsmanship and martial arts, follows an inexorable path of destruction, culminating in a brilliantly choreographed showdown with the Bill of the title, her former lover and hit man boss who decided to turn his gun on her when she ran off and left him.  But the surprise - and triumph - here is that the showdown turns out to be one not of bullets and blows, but of words and ideas.<br /><br />The plotting could not be more simple and direct, a series of cat-and-mouse fight scenes, periodically interrupted by flashbacks showing how Beatrix got to where she is today.  Quentin Tarantino's trademark dialogue is sharp, imaginative and witty, and the violence is a fascinating hybrid of the cartoon-like and the graphic.  Tarantino is a lover of movies and this is reflected in the stylish look and sound of the film: the beautiful compositions, the bizarre camera angles, the razor-sharp editing, and the glorious soundtrack, all of which make this an eye-filling and ear-caressing experience for the viewer.<br /><br />Uma Thurman delivers a pitch-perfect performance as Beatrix, bringing a mixture of steely-eyed ferocity and warmhearted tenderness - as well as an amazing athleticism - to the role.  She is more than matched by Keith Caradine as the terrifying yet strangely likable Bill - and their final confrontation scene, in which these two natural born killers sit down and discuss both their love and hatred for one another before squaring off in their battle to the death, is amazingly compelling in its complexity and depth.  It is here where the "Kill Bill" saga finally becomes a work of art.  As a result, this second film is a more satisfying work overall than the first.  But, taken as a whole, this is certainly Tarantino's best work since the seminal "Pulp Fiction" from ten years earlier.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>(Almost the same as my review for Kill Bill Vol 1)......Cliff Note synopsis: Everyone gets it good!

I was anxiously awaiting Kill Bill vol.2.<br /><br />After a the day it came out, my friend said it stunk because it had hardly any violence.  I decided to check it out anyway, I thought maybe it had a story.  So when I checked it out just like my friend said it was low with voilnece, but the plot was the movie's saving grace.<br /><br />Kill Bill vol 2 totaly fills all the voids that it's predicessor had.  You find out all the answers to the questions Kill Bill vol 1 left you with.<br /><br />This movie still has it's moments of violence, but only few people die, compered to the 74 that died in Kill Bill vol.1.<br /><br />Altho I usally prefer violence over plot(Ex. John Woo movies), this movie also had a touchy side to it, which got me a little, but not much.<br /><br />Those who loved Kill Bill vol 1, but are expecting all violence and gore, and no plot, will undeniably be dissapointed.

People thought the first one was better. It was only because of its array of anime sprinkled in with blood squirting action. This one is more of a layed back, fill in the blanks movie. You dont have to sit threw this one then watch the first one to get it, its like its complete all on its own. Flashbacks to the past with Bill and Beatrix Kiddo fill the blanks.Pie Mei is a hoot as the white long bearded,small, old chinese guy. Subtitiles and foreign language get to be boring after awhile but once the action kicks in, in the final 2 chapters it's worth it all. The final climax with Elle and Budd is great, as Michael Madsen(in a role fit for him) gets venom from a snake in him. The plucking of the eyeball part and bitch-fight scene between Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman was a highlight. The final chapter is longer then the rest, being the final chapter. David Carradine plays Bill to the maximum. Folks, Tarantino loves to create story and long pieces of dialouge, he knows what he is doing. Loved Bill's speech about all the superheroes. Loved Thurman all dirty and sweaty. Loved everything about this movie. A movie too good for itself. Samuel L.Jackson has a small cameo in the wedding scene. Though no one can beat Charlie Brown in the first one, he ruled. The Kill Bill scene where she pokes him in the chest was a little let down but still, great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, Vol. 2 completes the vengeful tale of the Bride (Uma Thurman).  Although there is plenty of violence in the second chapter, it is nowhere near the over-the-top blood spilling of the first film.  Instead, the film goes into the relationship of the Bride and Bill (David Carradine) and the Bride's past (we even learn her actual name).  One excellent scene is the training of the Bride with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) that contains some excellent Kung Fu action.  The best fight sequence is between the Bride</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>if i had not been set up by the first movie, id have given this a fifth star. it is indeed (i suppose) just as good as its partner, but i miss the sense of humor in part 1. and i miss gogo! still, carradine does neat homage to himself, and uma rox.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This movie has the feel of a comic book brought to life (in fact, the first half of the movie actually has a segment consisting of comic book animation). This stylistic choice enables Tarantino to present a lot of potentially very disturbing material, especially abundant violence in Volume 1, while making this material reasonably palatable (and I generally don't like watching violence). It also gives the movie a sort of surreal and twisted feel which makes the movie suprisingly engrossing. On the other hand, the plot and characters are relatively cartoonish (though the acting is solid), and I didn't really discern much deeper meaning in the movie, despite a total running time of about 4.5 hours. In short, this movie is entertaining in a way that might even tempt you to watch it more than once, but don't look for anything more than entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is unique, a film unlike any I've seen before.

This movie also looks fantastic on Blu-Ray......a real treat for the eyes.<br /><br />After the ultra-violent Kill Bill Vol. 1, this movie was shock. There is no shouting in here, no yelling, just a few very sick killers with good vocabularies talking to one another. It sounds boring, but it wasn't to me. Even the trailer-trash lowlife played by Michael Madsen, had a good way with the words.<br /><br />The violence in here is not that prevalent, and it's not the brain- numbing kind that made up most of the Vol. 1 in this two-part story.<br /><br />Yeah, I liked this stylish film.

Well vol 2 is the much better film, so the answer is yes.<br /><br />Curiously enough although Vol 2 is longer, it seems to have a tighter construction. Some of the chapters are breath-taking, perhaps because they are shorter. The Pai-Mei chapter is simply marvellous. Uma Thurman gets her training with Pai Mei and Bill tells her "remember no sarcasm, no back-talk at least not for the first year or so, gonna have to let him warm up to you"! The Pai Mei chapter ties a lot of things together as well.<br /><br />Oh yes in vol 2 we get to see Bill for the first time. David Carradine is great, very cool, and occasionally seems to become Kwai Chang Caine again all these years later.<br /><br />I'd recommend seeing Vol 1 first, although it isn't quite as essential to do this, as it is to watch vol 2 after watching vol 1.<br /><br />This is fabulous entertainment made by a master film-maker and I strongly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan.  I've seen all of his work and studied all of his writing and let me tell you, this is some of the best dialogue that I have heard in any movie since, well, Pulp Fiction.<p>The best scene (that there is no fighting in) would have to be Bill's speach about Superman.  Also, Budd and Elle have some great dialogue along with the Bride.  Oh yeah, her name is finally revealed, but I didn't understand why it was such a big secret.<p>This movie is a lot slower paced then Vol. 1.  If you haven't seen Vol. 1 then you will not know what is going on in this movie.  There aren't as many fight scenes in this movie.  But the one fight scene between Thurman and Hannah is definately worth remembering.  <p>This movie was really good.  I personally liked the first one better, mainly because there was a lot more action.  I wish that Samuel L. Jackson would have had a bigger role in Vol. 2, but no everything can go my way.

There was less action, and the focus was more about the characters, which is usually not necessarily a bad thing, except for anticipated build-up to a climax that was never there.  In addition, I personally enjoyed the anime sequence in the first film and sadly felt that a similar animation would have made the second movie more enjoyable, but I do understand Quentin wants to give homage in different ways.  On another note, I feel that this film was more apt to grab the audience's emotions, although even this was weakly carried out.  Those of you who really enjoyed the first one will be let down, at least a bit.  However, as the homage that it was meant to be, I still say that it is overall not a bad movie.  Also, for the families, if you did not know it is definitely violent, with less displays of overt bloodshed that stood out in the first movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I have just seen Kill Bill vol.2, on an IMAX screen, an hour ago, and it was perfect.

Each fight and encounter of how she faces these characters is briliant in it's own way.<p>There were moments where I though " how on Earth will she get out of this blunder" and then there are some great conversatins she has with the people she came to kill. There was a bit less fighting, and more talking than in the first one. But all the action sequences were awesome. The one with Elle in teh trailer was great! Dont want to spoil it, but it's eye grabbing!<p>Overall, it was a beautiful movie, with views of the El Paso, desserts, and a hot climate. The music was amazing as well. A  lot of Ennio Morricone goosbump producing melodies. I think of it more as Vol 1 and Vol 2 as being a perfect one movie all in its own, and I think the Kill Bill saga, has became my favorite movie of all time.

But, then again, so does she."<br /> - Budd informs his brother, Bill, he isn't afraid of commitment in "Kill Bill: Volume 2".<p>Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue (in this case its a pregnancy test). "The Bride" finishes what she started as she closes in for the kill in "Kill Bill: Volume 2".<p>"Vol.2" continues the story of "The Bride's" revenge with the chapters "The Massacre at Two Pines" (the viewer finds out it wasn't actually a wedding but a dress rehearsal), "The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz", "The Sadistic Training of Pei Mai", "Elle & I", & finally "Face to Face" (for the record, O-Ren Ishii, a.k.a. "Cottonmouth", received a tragic brain transplant, while Vernita Green, a.k.a. "Copperhead", got "The Bride's" point over a bowl of "Kabooms" in "Vol.1"). <p>The film, like "Vol.1", has "cult film" written all over it (this has got to be, arguably, Quentin Tarantino's two best films). "Volume 2" is less violent than the first "Bill" and keeps the blood spurting in check. The action is still great (the fight between Hannah and Thurman is claustrophobic and has some funny moments, but, I couldn't stop thinking where in the hell that damn snake was hiding! Since I hate snakes, I was waiting for it to jump out!). <p>The performances were great throughout. Michael Madsen gives an outstanding performance as Budd (its hard not to like the guy. Yeah, even after he puts 2 slugs (full of rock salt) into "The Bride's" chest & then buries her alive). He also has some of the better lines in the film ("Wrong brother, you hateful b*tch." , is his greeting to Elle Driver on his cell phone). Daryl Hannah is awesome as the menacing, hateful Elle Driver (it hurt to see Budd go into that final goodnight but it was great at what happened to Elle!). Uma Thurman's cold, pissed off, daggers in the eyes, facial expression's to Bill while she hugs her new found daughter was the price of admission alone and David Carradine, as Bill, goes from phantom menace in the first "Bill" to jilted lover in this film is quite a revelation. The final showdown itself is quite good but not what I expected.<p>Tarantino's direction is great, as always, this time, paying tribute to the spaghetti western (think desert heat. Lots of it). Hittori Hanzo is heard but not seen. The soundtrack is outstanding, borrowing from the great Ennio Morricone and artists Chingon, & Shivaree (both play over the closing credits). "Kill Bill" is a must see for fans of the Shaw Bros., Sergio Leone, westerns and any and all action films of the genre.<p>I'm anticipating "Volume 2" to hit DVD in Sept. or Oct. of '04 and hopefully, an ultimate box set with director commentary (Tarantino certainly has the mouth for it) with everything but the Vasilube thrown in sometime in the near future.  <p>Above all, "Kill Bill" is, basically, a love story. What a valentine. Thanks "Q & U".</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>If you came to watch Kill Bill, Volume 2, expecting the same type of flick as Volume 1 you may be disappointed. While Vol. 1 was an action driven romp based on the old kung-fu style of filming, Vol. 2 is a more cerebral driven film based on the old spaghetti-western of the late 60's/early 70's. This is a slower paced movie, and as a result, a better plot-driven movie. You could say Volume 1 was merely a introduction to the main story of Volume 2.<br /><br />As with Volume 1, we are treated to a storyline that keeps jumping back-&-forth over a four-year period. After the climatic fight scene with O-Ren at the end of Volume 1 we start Volume 2 back at the masacure four years previously. We are finally introduced to Bill ( a voice only in Vol. 1), played nicely by David Carradine. And we get to see in detail the events that lead up to the masacure.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, Volume 2 is a slower-paced, plot-driven movie. Whereas Vol. 1 had three great fight scenes there is really only one decent fight scene here, between the Bride and Elle Driver (played surprising well by daryl Hannah). This fight probably has the most satisfying ending of all, which I won't give away. Just be forewarned, you could get a wee-bit squemish here. After eliminating Driver from the picture we are finally ready for the showdown between the Bride & Bill.<br /><br />Unfortunately, here is where the movie begins to drag, just a little. First, we have a scene in a Mexican Brothel where "Bea" finds out where Bill is. Then, we see her arrive at the hotel to discover that her daughter is still alive. Although this was a wonderfully played out reunion between Mother & daughter it only leads us to a long drawn-out scene between Bea & Bill where Tarantino must have felt he needed to tie up all loose ends. This part really was almost anti-climatic. We wait through approximately 15 minutes of explaination to see approximately 10 seconds of the climatic fight. It was a just wee-bit disappointing, I'm sorry to say.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed the movie. And like the first, it is strangely additive. I would recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>If Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a samurai movie, then Vol II is a spaghetti western.  To recap - The Bride has polished off Vernita Green and Oh-ren Ishi (and her bodyguards) in what was essentially a wall-to-wall action fest of Kung-fu and swordplay.  Having done in two of the group that massacred her bridal party, The Bride sets her sites on the remaining three perpetrators - Elle, Bud, and the boss of the group, Bill.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the ads of the film know that Elle and The Bride have their battle in a mobile home in the desert.  In fact, most of the action of the film takes place in and around this trailer, as it happens to be owned by Bud, who also meets his fate there.  The Elle/Bride battle is, in fact, the only large-scale fight scene in the film.  The pace is much slower with significantly more dialogue than Vol. 1. This is to my liking - Tarantino shines his brightest when his characters are serving up their versions of philosophy.  Especially brilliant is Bill's exposition on the difference between Spider-man and Superman, as pertains to their secret identities.<br /><br />Much is answered in this film - how Elle lost her eye, how the Bride became such an efficient killing machine (and why she fled Bill's group), and we even learn the Bride's real name.  Other things are never explained - why everyone hates Bill so much, for example.  There are few surprises - the audience is likely to be ahead of the plot.  However, such is Tarantino's editing technique and dialogue pacing that the plot is never important - it's not about what happens so much as how it happens.  And there are a couple genuine surprises that are all the more effective after thinking you have everything figured out.<br /><br />This is a fine movie, and a worthy second part (not sequel) to the first.  Although my favourite individual scene (the escape from the hospital) is in Vol. 1, there is more in Vol. 2 that is memorable, because it's more dialogue driven.  I wonder if Tarantino plans to recut the films and mix up the scenes in some future special edition version?<br /><br />On that note, I will repeat the warnings of some others - don't bother buying this DVD.  Mirimax is notorious for their crappy first-release DVD's, and both Vol. 1 and 2 have no worthwhile extras (although a cut scene of a fight between Bill and an unidentified assailant is mildly interesting).  Since the films work as a whole, wait until the special edition set comes out.  I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>KILL BILL: VOL. 1 surpassed my highest expectations.  Being the Big Q.T.'s first sequel, I wasn't sure how KILL BILL: VOL. 2 would turn out.  Why would I even worry?  With Q.T. at the reins, there's no way KB2 was gonna suck.<p>The film, naturally, begins with Chapter Six, entitled "Massacre at Two Pines".  It deals with the events that took place before the event that left The Bride (Uma Thurman) a widow.  By the way, we do learn her name by the end of the film - but, just to keep you happy, I won't tell ya.  After this segment, and a 50's-style intro by The Bride herself, we pick up where the first film left off - with three more names on her list - retired redneck Budd (a.k.a. Sidewinder - Michael Madsen), treacherous and skilled beauty Elle Driver (a.k.a. California Mountain Snake - Daryl Hannah), and the big man himself: Bill (a.k.a. Snake Charmer - David Carradine).  There really isn't much of a story to give away - The Bride's still looking for satisfaction, on her rampage, bla-bla-bla.<p>KB2 may be even more campy than the first film.  It certainly features more references to other films, particularly the Shaw Bros. pics of the 70's (which starred Gordon Liu, who plays kung-fu master Pai Mei).  It is, like the first film, completely entertaining, and - more than once - very funny.  One thing's for sure - if "Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction" and the first "Kill Bill" didn't prove it, "Kill Bill: Vol. 2" sure does - no one makes films like Quentin Tarantino.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>If you turn your mind off and go along for the ride, there's plenty of Uma, mayhem, Uma, nicely-done fights, and Uma.<br /><br />Plausibility? Well, not a lot. I suspended disbelief until my arms got tired, then the implausibility of the Holy Mother, loud noises that no one notices, and day to day use of a visible sword as fashion accessory kind of got to me.

I almost expected to see the first ultrasound tattooed on someome's arm.<br /><br />OK as airplane entertainment, as long as it's free and there's no way to get out of the plane. Missable otherwise.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>I saw Kill Bill, Volume 2 in the theatres and on first watch, I considered it vastly superior to the first Kill Bill.  But after having picked up the DVD release the second it was released, and then tried to rewatch it all the way through, I realized it was a smoke screen:  Volume 2 is better than the first, but it's still deeply flawed and not even close to the lasting impact of Reservoir Dogs, or even Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />There are moments of greatness:  Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver is on fire, playing the gleeful, deliberate evil of the character to perfection as she gives what may be the greatest Tarantino monologue since Samuel L. Jackson's "the weak and the shepherd" speech in Pulp Fiction.  Tarantino deserves marks for seeing the sleazy charm in Hannah.  David Carradine is perfection as Bill, stunningly charismatic, although without giving any spoilers, I should warn you that you won't get to see him fight very much.  You can tell Tarantino got a kick out of having Gordon Liu play the white-browed mystic Pai Mei, and Tarantino chose a great child actress for the crucial role of "BB", Perla Haney-Jardine, who becomes probably the youngest actor ever to nail that eccentric Tarantino tone.<br /><br />The problems?  Episodic plotting, cheesy touches, overlong scenes and a howlingly dissatisfying climax.  Neither Kill Bill film had a satisfying narrative, concentrating on filmmaking virtuosity and great shots rather than cohesive storytelling, and while the greatest scenes still pop out at you, they don't add up to a journey you'd want to revisit over and over.  And in Kill Bill, Vol. 2, you have to wade through a lot of crap to get to the good stuff:  The Mexico sequence is excruciating, featuring a pimp character, Esteban Vihaio, whom nobody cares about, played by an actor, Michael Parks, whom Tarantino just loves for no reason.  (Parks also played the dropdead boring sheriff in the first Kill Bill.)<br /><br />Perhaps he was embarrassed for the overload of gore in the first Kill Bill, because Tarantino piled on the sugar in the last act of this film and mired his own film in unnecessary, cheesy sentiment.  "AKA Black Mamba, AKA Mommy"?  Give me a break!  Also, the relationship between The Bride and BB works just fine without the lovey-dovey last scene, which seems to serve no narrative function.  Or, maybe this last scene is doomed because the climactic showdown right before it is non-existent.  You don't set up a great character like Bill and have him go down in a whimper.  Tarantino has done this kind of ending before in Pulp Fiction, where the focus is on dialogue and acting rather than physical confrontation, but here, he's working within the confines and expectations of a martial-arts film.  No martial-arts film, even a Quentin Tarantino one, should leave the audience hanging by giving a dizzyingly unsatisfying 20-second climactic showdown.  If Tarantino had nixed that useless Esteban Vihaio sequence, he could have bought himself eight, 10 minutes to actually work out Bill and The Bride's final confrontation.<br /><br />I've had this DVD for over two weeks now and put it into my player about a dozen times.  After the first time I tried to rewatch the whole thing (and nearly dozed off), I just started perusing only the best scenes, which at their best are just fantastic:  The Pai Mei training; the superbly funny Elle Driver monologue and the subsequent trailer fight; Bill's pre-climactic scenes with BB and The Bride; and the wonderful, trademark-Tarantino "Lisa Wong's assassin" confrontation scene.  Everything in between, unfortunately, was so dependent on not knowing what's about to happen that when you've seen it once, you will never want to see it again.<br /><br />Is this DVD worth owning?  Yes, just for the delicious highlights -- just watching Daryl Hannah and David Carradine steal the scenes is enough.  But be prepared for an erratic ride that will lose steam as you take it a second or third time, and keep your finger on the chapter-skip button, because at the end of the day, Kill Bill Vol. 2 really is a mix between half a fantastic movie and half a cheesy, overlong dud.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>?Revenge is a dish best served cold.?<br /><br />  When we last left off, Quentin Tarantino has re-emerged onto the Hollywood scene for the first time in six years with not just one but two films to be released into theaters to an overwhelmingly awaiting cult audience. But not everyone was especially happy with the decision of both Tarantino and his distributor, Miramax Pictures, to split the tale of The Bride in two. There were some in the vast assortment of captious movie-goers that took this as a sign of continued greed amongst the ?Hollywood elite? in that the decision of splitting the film into two parts was done to get the loyal fans to shell-out double the normal ticket price for essentially one film. Granted, in the end, that turned out not to be the case, as the film would actually be five hours in length and thus be deemed too long to be taken all at once, but the issue still remained whether the rest of Hollywood would follow in the foot-steps of Kill Bill and spark a brand new trend, only this time with less honorable then Tarantino did. That is still to be seen and perhaps that argument is a bit overzealous ? In this situation, one shouldn?t question what could happen in the future but whether or not the primary influence, namely Kill Bill, did what it claimed it would accomplish, by delivering movie-goers ultimate satisfaction for dollar.<br /><br />  Kill Bill (Volume II) is the second, and possibly final, installment of the story that centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. For those unfamiliar with the first installment, here is a slight recap of previous events:<br /><br />  A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc?, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins and then Vernita Green, aka Copperhead. Upon completing the task of killing her first two targets, The Bride continues on her rampage determined to kill everyone on her list, all the way to Bill.<br /><br />  The second installment picks up basically where the first one left off, leaving The Bride heading to her next target, Budd (aka Sidewinder), who happens to be the run-down and vastly inferior brother of Bill himself. But, for at least a few moments, Budd gets the upper-hand on the film?s lead assassin by placing her in a coffin and burring her alive. In the time it takes her to escape, the audience is informed on the vast training The Bride took in order to become the superior apache she is today. Upon escaping the make-shift grave, The Bride duels with her contemporary rival, Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake), who not only killed Pai Mai but has her eyes set on The Bride herself. The final lag of her journey brings her to the home of Bill himself and along with him comes a little surprise: her daughter. The story for Kill Bill (Volume II) is quite arguably vastly superior to the one written up for the first installment in that this one deals not so much with action but dialogue and meanings discovered behind actions made by characters throughout this film as well as the previous installment. Once again Tarantino demonstrates his remarkable filmmaking skills by back-tracking the story at precise moments that by doing so will explain actions yet to come. Few writers can pull such an effect successful and Tarantino does so brilliantly.<br /><br />  As was said with the previous installment, a relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film, but this time around we introduced to a slightly different lot from the last film. Michael Madsen gives a dead-on (no pun intended) performance as Budd, a run-down and subjacent version of his former self now that he is no longer in the hit-man business. Madsen gives a sense that the character really contemplates on what he has done and whether or not he feels remorse for those actions but at the same time showcases the scoundrel that still lives within him. Daryl Hannah is quite intriguing as Elle Driver, clearly the most ruthless and baneful character in the film series. The only problem with her role was the dreadfully over-the-top performance given when her character?s eye was plucked out. Granted having one?s eye plucked out isn?t a pleasant manner but what Hannah presented on screen was unconvincing and quite annoying after some time. Uma Thurman?s role in the second installment can?t be complimented more then her role in the first ? She gives an absolutely brilliant, witty, and exhilarating performance that works every moment she is on screen. And David Carradine, best known for his Kung Fu television series, gives a ?sweet?, vibrant, and utterly perfect performance as the title character, Bill. He shines in every scenes he is presented in and works exceedingly well with Uma Thurman ? There isn?t much to say other then ?Bravo?!<br /><br />  Overall, Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself ? actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system ? maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. Those who were truly engulfed by the blood and gut spilling actions of the first film will be greatly disappointed by the second installment unless you are one of those geeks who enjoy dialogue far more then comical violence, which may not be too many. But if there is even just a few then that will demonstrate the true essence of maturity amongst the movie-going public. Despite a pacing that made the feature feel a tad longer then was probably necessary, Kill Bill (Volume II) serves as a fitting conclusion to Quentin Tarantino?s near perfect masterpiece ? a masterpiece that may take quite some time to surpass but if the young filmmaker keeps putting out work like his previous films, his cult audience is more then willing to wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>I'am so glad I could go see KILL BILL VOL.2 in theaters on the opening weekend. QUINTIN TARANTINO is my all time favorite filmmaker, he is the greatest of all time. This film took almost an entirly diffrent turn from the first installment. Where the first one was almost all violence [which was great]this one was more about a focus on characters. Don't get me wrong there was still enough of that in here. <p>This one starts out with the wedding massacre and draws it's tone off of that. It's more about the characters and their lives, and their history. We start off with Bill coming to wish our hero good luck with her new life and you know what happens from there. In fact we see BILL through out the entire film, and that was a wise choice because he is a great character.<p>I find it really funny that MICHAEL MADSION's character did what a bunch of ninja's couldn't do, defeat her. All he did was sit in his chair, wait for her to open the door, and blasted her. Then came the really messed up part when he buried her alive, man that was great.<p>Next up was the history of how she was trained to have all that skill, and that guy was great. He made me laugh the whole time, that guy was great. That actually might be my favorite parts of the movie.<p>Through out the film we get a little look at the history between BILL and "THE BRIDE" [you'll find out her name]. Those scenes have alot of impact on the final sequence of the film. If you don't pay attention the end might not make sense to you.<p>And like I said there is a nice amount of violence in this one, like when the beatifull Uma Thurman battles that one eyed chick. Wait till you see what happens.<p>The cinematography for this film was amazing, the shots threw out this film were just so good. And of course the writing for it was outstanding.<p>I don't really want to give up to much and ruin it for you, I highly recommend you all go out and see this movie ASAP.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>sorry to all you action buffs out there, but kill bill vol.2 is the very best tarantino flick ever!  what a great story, what terrific acting by all, i could go on and on-kill bill vol.1 was very entertaining-but almost no story line  part.2 is sheer brilliance; i loved it-together they are the sum of all parts, i guess-but part 2 is and will be honored as a cinema masterpiece!  bravos to all involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Kill Bill is an undisciplined, self-indulgent mess.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A whirlwind of chaos can be amusing, or even thrilling.  Unfortunately, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more like a mess you'd find in the closet of a guy who lives in a basement apartment in his mother's house; a guy who smokes too much weed, or dropped too much acid in high school.  It's the boring fantasy of a guy who is way less smart than he fancies himself, and who has allowing his head to be swollen, and his creativity to be drained, by narcissistic excess.<p>It's easy to see how Hollywood would gather around this muddy tripe.  After all, Quetin's a "genius," and how could something so incoherent be anything less than progressive gold?  Sorry, folks, but the Emperor's got no clothes.<p>The only redeeming parts of this movie involve scenes where Uma Thurman learns martial arts from a guy who jumped straight out of a video game, and who spouts mangled midwestern versions of zen wisdom.  Had the movie stuck to that kind of kinetic and campy fun, this film might have been a great entertainment.  Sadly, it doesn't.<p>As a parting note, Quentin, please don't dig anymore relics out to play important roles in your movies.

Any attempt to either recreate the magic of the first movie or go off in an entirely different direction would be very risky. It is even more risky to place the fate of your movie in the hands of David Carradine. To say that, for the most part, swords will stay sheathed and instead acting will rule the day in Volume 2 was an interesting move and had you told me ahead of time that it would be so, I would not have believed you. After the fact, I can say that David Carradine is a star.<br /><br />After much deliberation, I feel that I liked Volume 2 better than Volume 1. There were no characters that I enjoyed in Volume 1, while I loved the introduction of both Pai Mei (the martial arts master) and Esteban Vihaio (Bill's Spanish-speaking father figure). The highlight, however, was Bill.<br /><br />He is a charismatic man to whom it would seem everyone takes a liking. His scratchy voice, which borders on a whisper, somehow soothes and calms. No one should wonder how he, with his charm; inteligence; and martial arts ability, rose to his position of power. And yet based upon what we know about Bill's relationship with The Bride, it is no surprise that the series is titled "Kill Bill."<br /><br />I never expected to be so impressed with the writing in a Quentin Tarantino film. The story, though cheesy, was well planned out and the dialogue was perfect for the feel and direction of the film. The plot of the first movie was like a bunch of boulders placed next to each other, and Volume 2 was the sand poured over them to fill in the gaps. Most of Volume 2 was the back story which was lacking from Volume 1, but not so noticeably absent that it was not entertaining. There were questions that went unanswered until the second installment, which is expected in a series.<br /><br />Kill Bill Volume 2 added depth to the plot and the characters introduced in Volume 1. It featured martial-arts fighting scenes, but introduced more verbal sparring than its prequel. Uma Thurman is the headlining star of the Kill Bill series, but David Carradine stole the show when he breathed life into Bill while The Bride tried to take it away.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Part two of Kill Bill is excellent in it's own right.  As the second part of the duo, though, it lacks a little of Part One's energy.  Hence the 4 rather than 5 stars on this entry.  Uma continues to amaze here as the Bride and in this installment, I half expected her to have a shootout with Eastwood - both wearing dusters, of course!  Hannah is a hoot in this and her showdown with the Bride gives Lucy Lui a run for her money.

I meen it! QT it one of the best directors around and he has crafted a masterpiece! This is his 5th movie and he is in top form. "Kill Bill: Volume 1" was a rollercoster ride of thrills and spills, it had great action and effects with ok acting from Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, and Vivica Fox. But "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is a masterpice! "Kill Bill: Volume 1" was a good movie but "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is pure perfection! QT combines GREAT acting, a compelling plot, moving drama, incredible suspense, excellent sound and effects, fantastic action, hysterical comedy, GREAT directing and script and wounderful dialouge! QT is an amazing director and each one of his movies is a classic, "Resovier Dogs", "Pulp Fiction", "Jackie Brown", "Kill Bill: Volume 1", and now "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is his best movie to date. Though there is no where near as much action was "Kill Bill: Volume 1" some people don't like it. Though the bloody action was fun this movies action was much better and "realistic". I could never see these two films but together because they are totally different! Like I said "Kill Bill: Volume 1" is a adreline rush of action, and "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is a thought provoking charecter drama.<br />The acting is superb! Uma Thurman deserves an Oscar nomination for her role, and Daryl Hannah desreves best suporting actress because she was so good and funny. Uma is a great actress, her performence was so moving I was dumfounded! I can not express in words how good this movie was and I is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Since these are two different movies some will favor the first and some the second, for me the second is wonderful! This is one of my favorite movies and I am amazed how good it is! Bloody well done! Excellent film! I can not wait for QT's 6th movie!

Using just about every trick in the book, Quentin did just that, introducing us to 70s Blaxploitation flicks, anime, and a bunch of other styles I couldn't identify.  The anime was the most galling (both the actual animated short that had little relevance to the plot, and the attempts at live-action anime), as anime was meant to be a sort of shorthand for artists - the big eyes are easy to draw, the flashing movement means less frames, etc.  Quentin took it and turned it into some sort of art form and then acted as if he owned it, only he didn't pull it off convincingly to folks who know their anime.<p>But Kill Bill: Volume 2 (KB2), makes up for it.  Indeed, if the two movies had been edited down and put together, the whole thing would be a masterpiece.  Instead, it's a film that's good enough to make me wish Quentin had taken the deep breath he took between the two films and edited them down into a cohesive whole.<p>So what does KB2 do right?  <p>Quentin knows he had so much ridiculous violence in the first movie that it's probably still giving the Ratings board fits. So as a result, he uses the threat of violence to excellent effect.  The katana that The Bride normally wields is almost never used - indeed, the big "sword fight" keeps getting interrupted by the fact that the sword isn't always the right tool for the job.  Quentin lets us know that he KNEW he went too far in the first movie and it was to prove a point.  I just wish the first movie hadn't taken so long to make it.<p>Like the first movie, Quentin takes the time to pay homage to other flicks.  There's a delicious 70's Kung-Fu type flashback sequence with a white bearded, longhaired master.  Everything's there, from the sword hopping to the waist dodging.  Only this time I got it - I knew the films Quentin was mimicking and thought it was funny.  Also, he didn't bounce around at high speed amongst so many movie styles that it gave me a headache.<p>As always, Uma Thurman gets to emote.  She emotes rage, terror, and affection with great range.  Her lines are gawd-awful, however (I'm still debating whether or not that's on purpose).  Since there's less sword-fighting going on, Uma looks less ridiculous wielding her sword like it's an axe.  Uma's utterly unconvincing as a martial artist, so this is a good thing.<p>There are a variety of parallels in the characters and their depth.  Issues of motherhood vs. fatherhood, the well-being of a child vs. the violence a mother will go to protect said child, the ability to kill a man or let him ultimately kill himself, and even the theme of an eye-for-an-eye is present.  Quentin covers a range of topics and makes you think, makes you aghast at the situation, and then drives relentlessly forward with his own conclusions.  There are no hanging questions.<p>One word sums up this movie: focus.  Quentin retains it, keeps it, and draws the audience in along with him, even through some very long conversations where no limbs are being sliced up like fine ham. If there's a flaw, it's that KB2 is a very different film and it's likely impossible that people will love both equally.  <p>If KB1 was a series of flashy moves with no substance, KB2 is the gut punch that takes the wind out of you.  Two thumbs up from Maleficent and I.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Way back in October I went to see Volume 1, mainly because some of my friends were planning on seeing it.  My attitude was, to say the least, greatly changed before the release of Volume 2, which easily stands as the most highly anticipated movie release of my life, so much so that I eventually became concerned that it wouldn't live up to my expectations..  Fortunately, it did stand up, and proved to be the perfect companion to the already fabulous first half, and taken as a whole it stands as one of the finest achievements in film that I've seen..<p>As most everyone knows, Kill Bill was always intended to be one film, and was only split in half late into production.  This makes it particularly surprising and remarkable that the two Volumes are so extremely different.  All told, there is only about 5-6 minutes of action in the second volume.  Dialogue is, once again, King, easily compensating for the relative lack of it in Volume 1.  Furthermore, it moves in a completely different direction both visually and musically.  Gone are the urban and Japanese settings of the first film, replaced largely by rural settings in Texas and Mexico. The cinematography and editing are starker, and far less flamboyant.(though still far from conventional, for the most part) The more eclectic soundtrack of Volume 1 is replaced by one more fitting of the desert settings, relying heavily on Spaghetti Western style music along with some spanish sounding stuff and a bit of country.  All this means that those of you who loved Vol. 1 need to get the proper mindset coming in, as this is a completely different experience..<p>With the new emphasis on character and personality I suppose I ought to go into my thoughts on the acting in the film. Personally, I found all the main characters to be quite interesting and/or likable, and the acting was uniformly excellent.  Thurman brings out some genuine sympathy for the Bride, and adds a whole lot more emotional depth to the character than would seem possible after the first film.  Budd defies expectations as he is now a broken down and drunken slob, who is revealed to still have a propensity for sadistic violence. (Madsen does an excellent job of displaying 2 substantially different faces while still remaining the same character)  Elle proves to be more or less EVIL, and perhaps more of a caricature than a character, but I don't mind.  It's also cool how Tarantino leaves you wondering about why she is the way she is until the very end when it just sorta comes together through the final detail we learn about her.(or maybe that's just me) Of course, the real standout is David Carradine as Bill.  Bill defies expectations as well, as he was built up as a sort of mythic villain in the first Volume, and is now revealed, early on, to be far more human, and far more normal than that. He proves to be very likable and fairly sympathetic as well, and Tarantino doesn't cheat us in trying to do this by either excusing or ignoring what he's done. He's particularly excellent at the very end, as is Thurman.<p>Despite the emphasis on dialogue, what action they have is still first rate.  Each of the fights is very cool, with the fight with Elle being of particular note.  It provides a great contrast to the largely balletic and elegant motions of the House of Blue Leaves fight, as it is remarkably uncontrolled, harsh and brutal. The ending of it is quite hilarious as well, but I won't give it away. The fight with Pei Mei is quite cool as well, and even more stylized and over the top than the HoBL.(albeit in a different way.) In fact, the whole chapter with him is quite excellent, particularly the training montage and the campy silhouettes.  There's also an excellent suspense scene in Budd's part.  I won't give away any specifics, but it really manages to give a sense of claustrophobia and tension despite the fact that you know there is no way the Bride can die at that point.<p>Many have complained that this is too slowly paced and has too many extraneous scenes. I suppose I see where they're coming from, but I don't think anything should've been removed.  The scene with Budd and his boss isn't absolutely needed, but I think it works because it juxtaposes 2 very different sides of Budd when matched with the following scene of him and the Bride.  The most criticized scene, involving an old friend of Bill's named Esteban, is still useful in my mind, mainly because it provides a buffer between the fight with Elle and the confrontation with Bill.  However, another fight would've been nice, and probably would've made the pacing better. (Though I didn't think it was too slow anyway)  A fight with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would've been great, and would've proved to be the ultimate homage. (as a friend of mine pointed out) Though Kareem's getting pretty old and maybe he hasn't kept up with his marital arts. Still, one can dream...  <p>The highlight of the film is the final chapter, which is, obviously, the confrontation with Bill.  As many have said, it is primarily verbal, emotional and mental rather than physical.  This will disappoint many, who were hoping for another huge fight.  As great as another fight would've been I think this works better, particularly when you consider the 2 volumes as one film.(which is the only way to do it)  This allows the film to have both an absolutely first-rate action climax and a fantastic emotional climax, something which is exceedingly rare. It's also a pretty gutsy move to have an emotional, sorrowful ending after all the brutality preceding it, but they pull it off, and it turns out to be the best possible ending. <p>10/10  A+  5 stars  etc.</p></br><a href="../users/AYUFQY3XG4ZBR.html">AYUFQY3XG4ZBR</a><br/><p>It should be remembered that "Kill Bill" is essentially one movie split into two out of running length necessity; the (rather sensible) logic was that NO ONE would be able to take in a single feature that ran 248 minutes (just over 4 hours) in length.<br /><br />So what you have is a similar situation with "Kill Bill" as with Tarantino's last full-length film "Jackie Brown"; a good movie that (in my opinion) simply runs too darn long.<br /><br />"Kill Bill" peaked with "Volume 1", a movie that ran at just under two hours but seemed to go by much quicker, ham-fisted dialogue notwithstanding.  "Volume 2" is actually over two hours but seems to go by a third as fast.  "Volume 2" features much more introspection and less action than "Volume 1"...and as a result the plot just drags.  Introspection is well-used in a movie where there is a level of intrigue involved (see prior Tarantino examples "Reservoir Dogs" and even "Pulp Fiction" to a degree), but in an action spectacular like "Kill Bill" it does nothing but slow things down...BADLY.  The flashback sequences do this movie no favors (unlike "Volume 1", where the flashback involving Oren Ishii actually was one of that movie's true highlights), and the personalities of the remaining "deadly vipers" simply aren't as powerful as those slain (perhaps prematurely, in terms of plot pacing) in the first movie.<br /><br />That in itself could perhaps be forgiven...but the final act is such a tremendous letdown.  What should have been an epic battle between two warriors built up over nearly four hours of screentime as demigod-like figures is unforgiveably underdone.  David Carradine once infamously got on martial arts/action cinema icon Chuck Norris' bad side by failing to pull his punches in the filming of "Lone Wolf McQuade"; that and his history as Kwai Chang Caine would seem to warrant a more pronounced presence in the final confrontation.  But four hours of plot development (again with a reference to the length of the movies; I do apologize, but it does much to color my overall impression of both films as a whole) leads up to a fight sequence that lasts perhaps a minute, if even that?  That may be well and good for Sergio Leone pictures where the pull of a trigger takes but a second and ends a life equally as efficiently, but a good martial arts movie demands MORE and SUSTAINED ACTION (see "Enter The Dragon", "Return Of The Dragon" "Project A", and basically any Bruce Lee and/or Jackie Chan movie ever made for reference).  The Bride's fight with Copperhead and GoGo from "Volume 1" was far more exhilerating and much more worthy of a climactic ending than the inevitable showdown between Bill and The Bride (whose name, finally revealed, is one of the coolest things about this movie).<br /><br />Logically speaking, anyone who likes "Volume 1" should want to see "Volume 2".  However, while I can recommend buying "Volume 1", I can't in good faith say that my money was well-spent when I bought the concluding DVD.  I believe, knowing what I know now, I would have felt better with the story ending unresolved.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>With the huge box office success and critical acclaim for "Kill Bill Volume 1", you can assume that expectations were extremely high for the final act in Quentin Tarentino's twisted tale of vengeance and mayhem, "Kill Bill Volume 2".  The big question surrounding the movie was, `Can the second film possibly live up to the first one, in terms of story and entertainment value, and as an overall movie?'  The answer is actually quite mixed.  But before I give you the reasons for why the response to the movie was so mixed, I will give you the basic plot synopsis for "Kill Bill Volume 2".<br /><br />Picking up directly where "Kill Bill Volume 1" left off, `The Bride' is continuing her bloody quest for vengeance on her former mentor and lover, Bill, and his team of twisted killers.  With "Kill Bill Volume 2", the training for `The Bride' (Uma Thurman), is explored to show the audience how she is capable of killing with such ruthless efficiency.  After dispatching her brand of justice to the majority of Bill's assassins, `The Bride' doesn't have very much farther to go before reaching her ultimate goal of killing Bill.  But, the road to Bill is plagued with misfortune, and `The Bride' is going to need to use all of her training to survive.<br /><br />Now that the plot synopsis is out of the way, I can get back to why response to "Kill Bill Volume 2" was less than stellar, when compared to the response to "Kill Bill Volume 1".  With "Kill Bill Volume 1" director and writer Quentin Tarentino delivered audiences a twisted tale of revenge, that was filled with plenty of violence, and not much in the way of exposition.  Whereas, in "Kill Bill Volume 2", the violence is toned down, almost to the point of non-existence in some cases, to make room for the exposition.  The problem here is that audiences were expecting the rest of `The Bride' killing off all of her former crew and her mentor, with maybe some exposition to fill in some more of the how's and why's of the whole thing.  Instead, what audiences got was basically the origin of `The Bride', how she learned to fight, her relationship with Bill, and how the whole thing went south on them.  Basically, Quentin let down his audience by setting the bar too high for himself with "Kill Bill Volume 1".  In my opinion, Quentin would have been better off to drop in some of the exposition from "Kill Bill Volume 2" into `Volume 1' and spread the action out better over the two films.  Had he done these two things, audiences probably would have responded better to "Kill Bill Volume 2", and both movies would have been equally entertaining.<br /><br />Although, personally I thought that neither film was all that great, but that's just me and I'm not that big of a Tarentino fan.  But overall, the two films are at least worth watching once.<br /><br />"Kill Bill Volume 2" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>The smart money is to wait until a deluxe edition of the two films is released, BUT there is a terrific extra on this one I doubt will be included in the next and that is the performance footage of CHINGON performing "Malaguena Salerosa" at the premiere. It is AWESOME. I knew Robert Rodriguez composed music for KB2 but check out his guitar playing chops onstage and be blown away by the vocal work of Alex Ruiz.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This second part of the saga is by far less interesting than the first .

I was somewhat apprehensive since I didn't want to see all that blood and killing again, but I had to know what happened.  Actually, I was surprised at this one. This movie brought everything together, answered so many questions and actually had a pretty good ending. Yes, of course there was killing in it, but it also showed clearly the reason behind them.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if it was a happy ending or not and I have a feeling somehow this movie will have a part three.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Kill Bill Vol. 2" is the second half of a VERY long but VERY good movie by `cult' director Quentin Tarantino. Its distributor, fearing audiences would not sit through a movie over three hours long, decided that it be released in two parts. How this effected boxoffice I do not know. I do know that it is best viewed in its entirety. Movies running this long are rare but hardly without precedent. In 1939 MGM was faced with a similar problem with "Gone With the Wind", which clocked in at over 3 and ? hours. Initially, the studio planned to release the movie in two parts. Ultimately, a decision was reached to release it in the long format, albeit with an intermission. This proved to be a brilliant plan, and the movie went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time.<br /><br />In volume 2, The Bride [Uma Thurman] continues to exact her revenge. She continues to hunt down those who will lead her to "Bill", the man who mastermind the mass murder that occurred at her wedding.<br /><br />Tarantino strikes me as a `child-like' director, a boy who is mesmerized by all things related to movies. I mean this in a positive way. He sees things in a way a `child' would see them. So, perhaps, did Orseon Welles, or Mozart, for that matter. Vision is not a thing defined by age.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Kill Bill: Volume 1 was brilliant and definitely one of the most exciting, pulse-pounding cinema treats of last year.  Heavily influenced by kung-fu flicks, Tarantino set expectations at an unusually high level for the second part, promising itself to be a Western pastiche.  Of course, Tarantino is hardly a conformist and what initially struck me when watching Volume 2 was that it seemed to take great glee in undermining all my expectations of the Western elements I was looking for.  Take the promised backstory to the massacre at the chapel - we get a tense work-up with Bill coming to visit The Bride and then we hear but never see the massacre that ensues.  Take Budd, a bloated has-been who sits in his trailer guzzling beer and wearing a cowboy hat, the very picture of a genre truly dead and buried, past its glory days.  It's clear from here that Tarantino's toying with his audience's expectations, becoming a true master of suspense (notably in the scenes with Bill) and showing us what 'Western' means today.  It's not cops and robbers and epic gunfights but trailer trash violence Jackass-style where old-school warriors are misfits in a dead landscape.<p>Still, Tarantino's not lost his love of retro-pastiche and these still provide his most entertaining sequences.  The fight with Daryl Hannah is hilariously brilliant, with the two heroines reduced to fighting with foodstuffs and toilet bowls.  This and the training sequences between The Bride and Pai Mei.  Using the zoom shot, the begrudging cruel master and cheesy fight scenes, Tarantino manages to give his love for the genre with a touch of humanity when we get to see how The Bride uses her teachings to break free of a coffin in which she has been buried alive.<p>The main criticisms levellled at Volume 2 seem to be that it is slower than Volume 1 and has a masochistic attitude towards women.  The first is admitedly true in sequences and this never reaches the freewheeling fun of Volume 1, though once it gets going, Volume 2 is just as much a force to be reckoned with and is certainly anything but stale.  The second is a hard one, especially seen as The Bride is put through just about every kind of punishment possible, be it torture, near-death or the loss of her daughter.  In particular, the resolution, where an assassin grants her life because she's pregnant might seem hokey.  But Tarantino pulls it off to make this self-proclaimed 'roaring rampage of revenge' exciting and fun enough to get past any sentimentality.  A lot of people sneered at her love for Bill, but surely this was levelled by the apparent respect she had for him and Tarantino's acknowledgement that love cannot be simply transformed into hate so simply.  Thurman gives it her all as well, proving that she's one of the best actresses of her generation in a role that will probably define her for years to become.  She's impressed in her roles in Pulp Fiction and Gattaca, but never before has her performance been so determined and committed.  Of course, she's helped by a superb supporting cast.  Carradine exudes a surprising degree of menace and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen are both a hoot.<p>Okay, so Volume 2 isn't perfect, but along with its first part, it's the one of the most interesting, thrilling cinema treats in a fair while and even if the style isn't really your cup of tea, it's sheer exuberance (not to mention Tarantino's obvious talent and attention to detail) should be applauded.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>The Bride (Thurnman) is back, and set to continue her revenge streak in Volume 2.  Her targets: Elle (Hannah), Budd (Madsen), and of course, Bill (Carradine).  Along the way, we get flashbacks of her training and the wedding massacre that would set her on her course of revenge.  This is a better movie than Volume 1, focusing more on characters than action.  Volume 2 is also a (marginally) better film than Volume 1.  It can stand on its own, and feels more like a Tarantino film, despite being essentially a love story.  To me, David Carradine was the scene stealer as the titular Bill.  Whereas in Volume 1, he was a mysterious figure, he is probably the most developed character in Volume 2.  Tarantino has made two interesting films that really could have been shortened down into one that might have been better than the sum of its parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>First, be sure you stay to watch the end of the film.  That means through the credits of the main characters in color and through the black &amp; white credits with the Bride driving and through the long scroll of rolling credits.  Even when you get to the film's rating it is not yet time to go, so just sit there until the screen goes bright white.  Remember, you were warned.<p>Second, for everybody who thinks that on the basis of &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; that they know what is going to happen in &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 2,&quot; be ready to be surprised.  I made a point of watching the Bride (Uma Thurman) check Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) off of her people to kill list before I headed out to theater to see how the saga ended, so I thought I was perfectly in the narrative flow.  However, Quentin Tarantino has set up his audience just to play with their minds, which, of course, is what he was doing from the start and at the climax of this film I was not at all sure who, if anyone, was going to come out alive (especially since I was suddenly thinking about the tragic end of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;).<p>The caveat when Mirimax decided to split this four-hour revenge film into two volumes was that those who sensed a lack of character development and motivation in Volume 1 would be appeased by what was put forth in Volume 2, and this is indeed the case.  We finally get to go back and see a couple of pivotal scenes set before the &quot;beginning&quot; of the film's opening, with not only the massacre at the Two Pines wedding chapel but a training sequence in which the Bride studies with the great Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu), who will inspire many men to grow long flowing white beards that they can whip around dramatically as a punctuation to everything they say.  The net result is that character is more important than killing in the last half of the film, which makes sense because it would really be hard for the Bride to slice and dice more opponents than she did at the House of Blue Leaves.<p>There are a lot of oppositions between the two halves of this film.  The beautiful setting of the duel between the Bride and O-ren in the gentle falling snow is countered by the showdown with Budd (Michael Madsen) in the harsh sunlight of his trailer in the desert.  Having devoted an entire chapter to Hattori Hanzo creating his most perfect sword for the Bride, it is amazing how hard it is to get the sword out of its scabbard in this one.  Volume 1 was a feast for the eyes, but in Volume 2 Tarantino's dialogue becomes more prominent, although not quite up to the level of &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;  But the dialogue is important because before we get around to the titular business of this film, the Bride and Bill have got to have themselves a conversation.  Sound also matters more in this film: there is one sequence that is effectively done in the dark.<p>I am barely acquainted with the genre of Hong Kong films that Tarantino was apparently weaned on, so everything is fairly new to me and smacks more of homage than parody, which is not doubt the director's intent.  I probably will not go out and check out some of the films that inspired Tarantino to do &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; because they will undoubtedly pale in comparison to the slicked up version that he is serving for our American palates.  All things considered, I have a slight preference for Volume 1, which runs counter to the prevailing sentiments, but I am still working out how the two parts fit together.  The key thing is that they do, without Volume 2 being simply more of the same.  There is something to be said for Tarantino pulling out all the stops just to have fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Kill Bill Number 2 DVD<br /><br />Kill Bill Number 2 is a continuation of Kill Bill Number 1, of course, this time Uma Thurman finishes her revenge.

But, speaking of dialogues, it's been a long while since I've seen a film with more inane and ultraboring dialogues as in Kill Bill 2.<p>  Supposedly, once the "Bride", finally gets to "Bill" we should have the set-up for a tremendous climax. Instead, Bill and Uma sit it out, and start chatting merrily away, making us witnesses of a conversation equal in interest to early hours political talk shows. Tarantino attempts to put together a plot that has twists (ohhhhh, so Bill was Uma's ex!!! wow, how unbelievably interesting) but those "twists" would make even sophomore script writers fall asleep.<br />  And as for climax??? After Uma has gone through of hordes of kung-fu chopping thugs in Kill Bill 1, she finally meets the "Man", the "Boss", and what do we get? She puts him away with the ridiculous  "5 finger palm technique"? Mercy, mercy me..<p>  Alltogether, the ending of KB2, and specifically the last 30-40 minutes of it, has got to be one of the cheesiest, boringiest and draggiest endings i've seen in a long while. I was begging for the film to end no matter how. I was even more begging for them to stop talking the utter nonsense coming out both the characters' mouths...But my prares were answered...<p>  Before that, there was the momumental fight between Uma and Hanna, which served as one major highlight of the film and the other character, the Chinese kung fu master who was probably the most original character in both installments. But he only got (bizzarely) only 10 minutes of presence in the film, only to give his place to mega-bore Bill.<p>  Then there was the sequence with Uma digging herself out of 10 feet of dirt if not more. We are shown a  guy, who even uses a ladder (!!!) to climb out of the grave he's dug for Uma, and yet Uma, oh wonders, not only punches her way out of the coffin, but needs no assistance climbing out, because, oh wonders again, the grave has now become miraculously shallower????????? Puhlease....<p>  Such incredible plot jokes, were also in abundance in KB1, so i wasnt very much surprised to see Tarantino butchering his own script in the second part. <p>  But when it comes to surprises, i'll say this: i went to see the Kill Bill films very positively biased, being both a massive fan of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, both of which i consider classic films. But i kept in mind, that the last 2 films Tarantino offered us, were the highly forgettable "Jackie Brown" (yeah, anyone remember STILL that one? of course not) and the only at-moments-good but otherwise also forgettable "Four Rooms". And i wondered whether with "Kill Bill" Tarantino would shine again.<p>  I was dissapointed. Not so much becuase i didn't like the Kill Bill" flicks, but because I'm now heavily suspecting that Tarantino might never deliver a film of the high caliber of the 'Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And that is even sadder than the fact that Kill Bill was overall golden mediocrity with a ton of hype.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>ANd again, it is both a satire of the action film genre while honoring it.

While this movie is less violent than its predecessor, it's more story driven, but it doesn't feel any less epic in its massive scale.

It's an ok film that narratively stands on its own, but shows the utter superfluity of KB1, which could have had its backstory sliced to a 6 or 7 minute prologue. KB2 opens with the Bride ready to take on Bill's own baby brother- the 3rd member of the Assassins, Budd (Michael Madsen). After stalking him to his trailer home he blows her away with a buckshot of salt. Why he does not kill her with regular bullets is a silly question since this is comic book logic. Additionally, he offers to turn over the Bride's body to Bill's last assassin for $1 million. She's another blonde killer femme, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), who is missing an eye & wears a patch. Cue classic 1930s serial film villain stupidity: Budd buries the Bride alive. He even gives her a flashlight in her nailed coffin. Flashback: to her training under misogynistic Chinese Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This is needless digression because the stereotyped character- similar to KB1's involving the Bride's training with master swordmaker Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba)- adds nothing to the tale that could not have been added in a few casual throwaway references in the script.<br />  Length is also a big problem. The 2 films run 226 minutes, or just a quarter hour shy of 4 hours. They were originally to be a single entity but, having had so few films from Tarantino over the years his company wanted to double the bang for the buck. Thus the  mishmash editing. Individual scenes are expertly paced and woven, but there are just reams of scenes that do not advance the essential shark-like plot. This is not just taste speaking- too many scenes with trivial but wannabe colorful characters grind the film to a snail's pace. Trim the 90 minutes of KB1 down to 20 or 30 minutes of action, trim the 136 minutes of the plodding KB2 in half & you would've had a very good 90-100 minute film with all the excellent action and revelatory scenes intact. The KB films are a triumph of box office greed and marketing over potentially good art (-cum-self-indulgent pointlessness). Another thing gained by making the films one would be that the teaser at the end of KB1, where we find out Beatrix has a daughter, could be cut and that revelation unfold to both character and audience when she actually confronts Bill. Not that the emotion would have overwhelmed, but knowing this fact about Beatrix before she does castrates whatever empathy we might feel for her near the film's climax.<br />  That Tarantino did not see these points, or did but gave in to them, seems to support my belief that he has yet to show the maturity of a great director. He seemed to be going in the right direction with Jackie Brown (easily his best & most mature film) but has regressed with the 2 Kill Bills. Of KB2 I'd grade it 65 of 100, & for the duo of films I'd give it a 75. I hope I'm wrong, but he seems destined, and satisfied, to be merely an A director of B films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill: Volume 2" suffers tremendously from overindulgence.  Less certainly would have been more with this particular film.<br /><br />The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues on her revenge-fueled quest by seeking out Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen).  After disposing of them, she finally comes face-to-face with the target of her hatred - Bill (David Carradine).  However, the Bride's final confrontation with him is complicated when she learns that Bill has been keeping a very important secret from her.<br /><br />"Kill Bill: Volume 2" squeezes in as many pop culture references and homages as it can and the result is not pretty.  All this excess works against the film because it disrupts its pacing and overextends the dialogue so that certain exchanges seemingly go on forever.  Especially annoying is the psychoanalytic monologues that precede each life-and-death confrontation.  So flat and boring are the words that come out of the characters' mouths that it actually mutes the excitement of the subsequent action sequences.  "Kill Bill: Volume 2" would have worked much better if Tarantino did not try so hard to incorporate so many influences into his final cut.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Kill Bill, vol. II (Quentin Tarantino, 2004)<br /><br />The general consensus among fans is that vol. II of Kill Bill is not quite as good as the first (based both on reviews and its standing as I write in the IMDB top 250-- 93 as opposed to 58 for the first film). There is, of course, a vocal minority who violently disagrees. Allow me to add my voice to the minority.<br /><br />The main criticism of the second film, that it's not as well-paced, is well-taken. I think that would probably have been forgivable to more people if the film had been released as one piece; since I watched them back-to-back, I probably didn't feel the effect quite as acutely, either. Be that as it may, there is so very, very much to like about this film that I ended up liking it quite a bit better than vol. I.<br /><br />Michael Madsen plays insane, psychotic, extremely damaged characters in Quentin Tarantino films. (Anyone doubting this has never seen Reservoir Dogs, a movie Madsen's character stole right out from under at least four other Oscar-worthy performances.) He continues the trend of not only serious damage, but movie-stealing, in Kill Bill as Budd, a man who gets very little screen time given the duration of the film, but who has the most memorable character for all that. Madsen plays his character as a man of quiet malice who's gone to seed, but still sees himself as being a man of quiet malice. The part is written with the greatest complexity of any part in the film, and is played perfectly. Michael Madsen once again stamps himself as one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, and it is he, for the most part, who makes vol. II a better production than the first flick.<br /><br />There are other things about the movie that really hit hard, too. Revealing any of them would be spoilers, but let's just say that Tarantino manages a real emotional response without having taken any of the Hollywood shortcuts to get there, and that alone in a Hollywood film should be enough to make the critics sit up and take notice. (To be fair, many of them did.) That a product like this could come out of Hollywood is almost enough to give this overly-cynical critic a shred of hope that, between Tarantino and the epidemic of Japanese horror film remakes making scads of dough, some moron sitting in a CEO's seat at some production company is going to say "you know, here's some solid evidence, finally, that the crap we put out is all wrong, and there's a market for really good films." Don't hold your breath, but Kill Bill, vol. II, at least put the idea in peoples' faces. Whether they see it or not is still to be seen. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>it was blinding.

As a film ignoramus, I was not equipped to figure out just what films Tarantino is flashing to, but I could tell that he was doing just that consistently throughout this movie(I think I caught one particular Shaw Bros reference, but I can't remember the name of the flick for the life of me). Anyway, be prepared for a considerably lower body count than Vol.1-The Bride basically finishes off her list after being shot with rock salt, buried alive, and drugged. Watching her put down the miscast Daryl Hannah(she can't do mean) is definitely eye candy. That was a very bad pun, by the way, as you will find out should you see this. And you should.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>I'm afraid I'm going to have to go against the party line regarding KILL BILL VOL. 2: I simply wasn't as satisfied with this conclusion as I was with VOL. 1. If writer-director Quentin Tarantino has one fault as an otherwise truly tremendous filmmaker, it is that, in his immense enthusiasm for his art, he has a tendency to meander, or just to sprawl in general. He is so in love with a particular scene or group of scenes that he can't bear to cut it from the film even though it serves no obvious purpose to the film. The result is that the scenes slow the film's pace down (considerably, in the case of this movie). You had the silly scene in PULP FICTION (an otherwise awesome movie) in which Christopher Walken spent about five minutes speechifying about the history of a gold watch he hid up his ass during Vietnam, and now you have the long section involving Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) in this film. Sure, it's an interesting set of training scenes, with both Liu and Thurman pulling off some nice moves, and Liu makes the most of his juicy part---but did we really have to spend about ten whole minutes exploring this flashback just so we could understand how The Bride (Uma Thurman) could get out of a particularly sticky situation?<br /><br />But if overlength wasn't bad enough with this film, Quentin Tarantino seems to have altogether abandoned his usual quick-witted, fresh way with dialogue and paced some of the dialogue-heavy scenes---especially the final scenes with Bill (David Carradine) and our heroine verbally facing off---in a such a debilitatingly portentous manner that it literally sucked all the life and wit out of the dialogue. Frankly, I got bored after a while listening to these people talk so SLOOOOOWLY and with so many pauses in between each sentence. What happened here, QT? If this is your attempt at creating "atmosphere," then...well, perhaps you've been watching too many movies. (I suppose the overly portentous dialogue style was also present in VOL. 1, but the sheer energy level was too high to notice.)<br /><br />That is not to discount the many good things about this movie. Tarantino is still much the flashy technical innovator in this film, and he uses almost everything from B&W to the old classic 4x3 frame in this movie. The action scenes are once again dizzyingly, dazzlingly executed, with a particularly memorable fight between The Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) that climaxes with a real doozy. And look, I don't have a problem with this movie trying to be different and more character-driven than the more physically brilliant VOL. 1. It certainly helps that Tarantino still maintains his good touch with actors; his characterizations allow Thurman especially to shine in this movie, and she comes through with a weight of emotion that is startling and occasionally moving. And, of course, David Carradine is a revelation in this movie---as was John Travolta and Robert Forster in PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN, respectively---skillfully and charismatically playing a bad guy who turns out not to be as purely despicable as he seems.<br /><br />It's too bad Tarantino had to be so heavy-handed with the dialogue scenes, so much so that he nearly drowns the actors' performances and muffles the considerable wit of his own dialogue. Some might find the dialogue passages of the movie "hypnotic." Unfortunately, I found the lot of them "interminable" the way they were directed and paced, and thus I must say that VOL. 2 is a fairly steep dropoff from the highs of VOL. 1. Overall I simply can't call KILL BILL VOL. 2 one of Quentin Tarantino's best films.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>first the flaws.once again,the dead baby thing is no good.the end kind of sucks.it ends with them laughung together.besides one interesting story about superman,the final scene is a letdown.the story,carried over from the first part,has uma killing off the remaining people on her list including a redneck and a chick with one eye.that was a good fight.theres a bad ass burial scene that gave me the creeps big time too.then it goes back and shows her and some blind oriental dude from the skittles commercial who trains her.he treats her very poorly.then onto bill.the kids really shouldnt watch it due to rather innappropriate additions to thier vocabulary and graphic violence.quenten tarentinois your director,so you know its a godsend of a movie.i think it is better than the first one.i really liked the first one too.action fans and martial arts fans will probably like this one te most.it is emotionaly charged but the emotions are poorly in the last scene.umathurman is pretty hot.she has a very pretty face when shes buried.i know that sounds sick,but when shes in her casket shes pretty.that dude from kung fu the legends continues is bill.hes been in a bunch of cool movies like death race 2000 and cannonball run.the most intense part is when uma is buried alive.very spooky.i guess there cant be a kill bill 3.an excellent film.like i said,if it wasnt for the crappy final scene and the whole dead baby thing,it would have got a 5 star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I was so worried that the second offering would be a repetition of the first volume.  If that happened, the whole cinematic experience would become lame.  If you could remember the first volume, it was depicted in many styles and I was happy to inform you all that the second volume was a continuation of that.  Quentin said it well that whilst first volume was paying homage to the Eastern elements and second volume was paying homage to the Western elements.  The soundtrack was done by Robert Rodriquez (of Marichi's fame) and it fitted this movie very well.  For (violent) movie enthusiasts, I couldn't say this enough, this movie was made by someone who was passionate about his craft!  For those that missed Quentin's dialogues as we witnessed in Pulp Fiction, we gotta see heaps in this offering.  As David Carradine explained in the behind-the-scene, Quentin's movies were never about violence but providing us with an insight of how bad people ticked.  Thus, his willingness to partake in this project.  Gordon Liu was back second time around to play Pai-Mei (a bad arse kung-fu master who taught the Bride her martial arts skill).  This movie contained a lot of surprises like cameo appearances by the least expected persons, additional footage if you are willing to wait to the VERY end of credits, and we got to find out the real name of the Bride's name!  Highly enjoyable and truly watchable.  You would be crazy to miss this one.

While volume one was decent, volume two scenes drag on and on. The 2 Kill Bill movies could have easily been edited down to a 2 1/2 hour running time, but Tarantino decided to make one of the grandest exercises in self indulgence I have ever seen.  Volume two plays like an outtake/deleted scene featurette on a DVD.  Most of the scenes are useless, and they go way too long.  Critics gushed all over this, claiming it was full of real emotion, and that Quentin had matured as a filmmaker. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a film by a man who knows about movies, but not about real life. Tarantino grew up watching crappy Kung Fu films, sleazy European trash films, and bad Jack Hill films. And the influence (and the blatant ripping off) of them permeates his work.  If you need to watch a 4 hour film, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, or Once Upon a Time in America are available. One frame from any of these films is superior to Kill Bill.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'I'm the great Quentin Tarentino, director of such classics as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown.

I saw it in the theater with a buddy of mine, then forced my girlfriend to watch it when it came out on DVD.  She enjoyed it enough to accompany me to the theater last weekend and watch Volume Two.  I wish we hadn't gone now . . . <p>The thing that was so appealing about Volume One was how it made fun of films of old: excessive bloody violence (literally spraying gallons of crimson across the screen), corny music overlays, ridiculously impossible fight sequences, and a very old plot (revenge).  I absolutely loved the fact that an informed movie-goer could laugh at the gore spilling across the screen because it was meant to be that way.  Dark comedy some might call it, but it was actually a parody of sorts.  I was expecting something similar (maybe even more tantalizing) in Volume 2.  But it was not to be.<p>Gone were the extended and entertaining fight scenes, revenge took a back seat to back story (the showing of Bill coming to The Bride's wedding and the ensuing slaughter witnessed at the beginning of Volume One, The Bride's training at the hands of a Kung Fu master, etc.), and the absence of such important items as The Bride's list of people left to kill.  <p>The music, that was so impressive in Volume One, seems to have lost its "volume" in this second release also.  It was hardly noticeable.  Whereas in Volume One, it was paramount to the story as a whole.  <p>Although I love good dialogue (and there was some in this film, make no doubt about that), I don't care to have the film maker TELL ME EVERYTHING by having their characters explain all their motivations.  That ruined this film for me.  <p>Now there were interesting aspects to this film, however.  Most notably was the burial and escape of The Bride, and the dialogue of Darryl Hannah after she has a deadly snake bite someone.<p>I will give the film credit for not being formulaic, too.  I'm beginning to hate that about Hollywood.  This could've gotten overly-smaltzy at the end, but it wasn't.  The Bride's revenge will not be quenched until she kills Bill.<p>With the entrance of The Bride's unknown child (which we ALL knew would happen after viewing Volume One), it bordered on smaltziness.

The classic example was Dennis Hopper's elevation to zietgeist guru after 'Easy Rider' only to rapidly fall after being shipped off to Peru with a budget to play it again, Sam. The self indulgent results were the stuff of legend. Lumbered with a fiasco to rival Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guy's Don't Dance', the studio rightly calculated Kill Bill Vol 2 would have a sufficient fan base to be worth releasing and the die hards would pronounce it a masterpiece anyway. It has made money. Those of you who went to 'Reservoir Dogs' expecting to see 'an amazing, pumping powerhouse of a movie' (as the billing boasted) only to be confronted with a filmed stage play of tedious verbosity, will not be dismayed by the last quarter of Vol 2, which makes boredom almost an art form.

There was less action, and the focus was more about the characters, which is usually not necessarily a bad thing, except for anticipated build-up to a climax that was never there.  In addition, I personally enjoyed the anime sequence in the first film and sadly felt that a similar animation would have made the second movie more enjoyable, but I do understand Quentin wants to give homage in different ways.  On another note, I feel that this film was more apt to grab the audience's emotions, although even this was weakly carried out.  Those of you who really enjoyed the first one will be let down, at least a bit.  However, as the homage that it was meant to be, I still say that it is overall not a bad movie.

After the killing off Vernita Green (Vivica Fox), the bride (Uma Thurman) is looking for number 3 on her list, "Budd"(Michael Madson) she finds herself on Buds trailer in the middle of the desert. Budd is warned by Bill (David Carradine) that she is coming, the bride then simply realizes she has to go through Budd and Elle to go to Bill. Then as you would remember in the end of volume 1 Bill gives a message that her daughter is still a live, then the bride suddenly realizes her daughter is still alive. Quentin Tarantino delivers an astonishing film. This volume I like better than volume 1, but that's me. <p>In this film you see the training the bride had to go through. And in this volume they reveal the brides name. In the first volume it takes place in Japan, in this film it's a mixture of China, Mexico, and America.

As a big fan of 2003's "Vol. 1," I was eager to see the final chapters of the total film. After the film began, I was pretty much in complete shock during the entire viewing. As fast, kenetic, and high energy as "Vol. 1" is, "Vol. 2" slows down the pace enourmously. Tarantino's decision to decelerate the second half of his "Kill Bill" opus was both necessary, and masterful. At the end of "Vol. 1," the audience learns that The Bride's (Uma Thurman) daughter is still alive, while The Bride has believed her to never have been born. This is a clever device which serves two purposes: It gives the audience a terrific cliff-hanger at the end of "Vol. 1," but also sets an appropriate pace for "Vol. 2." Not only do we now that The Bride is on a collision course to finding out the truth about her daughter, but that there's no way she can prepare for said revelation. However, Tarantino brilliantly gets both the audience and The Bride ready for this confrontation through a more dramatic and heart-felt "Vol. 2" of his epic. By slowing the pace and theming of his second film, most of which takes place in the barren desert of the South-West United States as opposed to frenetic Tokyo, Japan of "Vol. 1," Tarantino forces The Bride, relax and take time to realize the path of revenge that she has chosen. In the end, it's an astonishing piece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Kill Bill, Volume 2 carried on the two-part Quentin Tarantino homage to early Asian films decently, however it did not hold up to its predecessor.

In addition, I personally enjoyed the anime sequence in the first film and sadly felt that a similar animation would have made the second movie more enjoyable, but I do understand Quentin wants to give homage in different ways.  On another note, I feel that this film was more apt to grab the audience's emotions, although even this was weakly carried out.  Those of you who really enjoyed the first one will be let down, at least a bit.  However, as the homage that it was meant to be, I still say that it is overall not a bad movie.  Also, for the families, if you did not know it is definitely violent, with less displays of overt bloodshed that stood out in the first movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>There is less action in this volume than in the first, which makes it more tedious.  To be fair this is just the wrap up of Volume 1, but I found the second installment to be quite boring at times.  There are several scenes that could have been cut from both volumes and they should have been combined into a single movie.  Splitting the movie was a cheap grab for more money and this ploy should not be tolerated in the future.  Worth a rent if you've already seen Volume 1 and need closure. Otherwise skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I don't buy the conceit that "Volume 1" is Tarantino's eastern and "Volume 2" is his western despite a predominately western setting and the co-opting of Ennio Morricone scores from Sergio Leone's westerns.  That said, this is a great movie.  Tarantino is still exploring the eastern themes that he did in "Volume 1" yet he is also exploring more mature character relationships that he did in my personal favorite film of his, "Jackie Brown".<br /><br />The likelihood is that Uma Thurman's multilayered performance(one moment she's a revenge-bent killer, the next a nurturing mother) will be overlooked at Oscar time because this film will probably be viewed in highbrow circles as a "genre film".  David Carradine also gives an excellent performance here.  You can almost sympathize with his rationalization for wanting Thurman's "Beatrix" dead for walking out on him.  After all, even killers can get a broken heart.  Not to be overlooked is Michael Madsen's performance as Budd, Bill's assassin brother turned drunken bouncer.  Madsen imbues this character with such pathos that we even like him despite him trying to bury Thurman alive.  The last chapter, where Thurman confronts Carradine seems to labor at times, however, Carradine's dissertation on the "Superman" myth may touch on the primary theme here.  We are who we are even if we try to escape into an alter-ego.  This may be Tarantino's way of saying that his films may be looked down on because they seem to glorify violence, even if their done stylishly.  However, Tarantino makes no apologies for making these films because they contain themes that interest him.  On a final note, the DVD contains a deleted scene that's pretty good.  I can see why it wasn't included in the theatrical cut because it doesn't seem to fit into the basic structure of the film but it should be checked out.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The continuation of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 begins with a quick recap that clarifies the Bride's (Uma Thurman) vengeful journey.  The Bride was mercilessly executed by her former boss Bill (David Carradine) and his associates at her wedding rehearsal as she tried to escape her violent past as a hired killer.  However, she survived and is now seeking those who drew the first blood.  This leads the story into several flashbacks where the Bride recollects her past which explains all parties reasons for violence.  These flashbacks fragments the storyline, yet each memory fills a void in the story as the characters are illustriously described on the silver screen.<br /><br />Tarantino maintains the visually brilliant experience that he initiated in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 where he uses cinematic nostalgia from different film genres.  The camerawork is flawless as it enhances the moment of each scene in an artistic as well as suitable manner.  In addition, Tarantino digs deeper into human values and morals as they conflict with character's backgrounds and traditions as the Bride seeks her vengeance.  The only thing that Tarantino does not improve is his score selection as it was superior in Kill Bill: Vol. 1.  Nonetheless, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 offers a violently alluring cinematic experience that has deep intrigues and much to ponder for a wide range of viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>More Dialogue and less action-packed than Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2, nevertheless, delivers the goods for those expecting a satisfying conclusion to this two-parter. Oh yeah, now this is fun movie watching. After the hilariously gorey Kill Bill 1, how on earth do you expect a sequel (which is actually just the 2nd part of the film) to top that? Why add some drama, create and atmosphere of intrigue and suspense, even some mystery, and a great eye gouging scene! I loved Kill Bill Vol.1 I mean I felt like I was watching a live action Anime! My sister happens to be an anime freak (I only claim to liking the Drangonball series) and she agreed that it was like an anime. Maybe that's why it is so, shall we say, unique. It takes the classic revenge story and puts a new twist on it, and thus Tarontino keeps his audience guessing thorugh the whole thing. The second and final volume in Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL series is another stylish, sprawling masterwork. VOLUME 2 picks up where the first film left off, as The Bride resumes her quest to track down her former mentor, Bill and exact revenge. But before she gets to Bill, she must first take out the remaining minions who helped to slaughter her best friends and fianc&eacute;. First up is Budd a quiet but dangerous country boy who lives in a trailer. Next is Elle Driver a one-eyed vixen who doesn't appear to have a heart--or a conscience. As The Bride makes her way closer to Bill, scenes from her past are revisited, including her training with the angry and brutal Pai Mei. Finally, The Bride locates her man, sparking a truly unforgettable confrontation. In contrast to the nearly dialogue-free first volume, VOLUME 2 is filled with extended conversations that bring the story full circle. Watch both Kill Bill's back to back and you'll have one entertaining evening awaiting you. Sometimes 5 stars just isn't enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>The outcome of this movie is known to all before they see the movie. The bride will get her revenge and `Kill Bill'. As in many Alfred Hitchcock movies, the suspense is not in the outcome, but how we get there. And, in this movie, the itinerary is well worth the trip. Unfortunately, this means I have to be very circumspect in what I say to avoid giving away any of the key plot points.<br /><br />I've never thought critically about any of Quentin Tarantino's earlier films, so I'm not sure whether this is true of all his movies or just this one, but I get the very strong impression that Tarantino's main directoral influences are Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, with a seasoning of Akira Kurasawa thrown in for good measure. There are long shots with no dialogue which strongly remind me of similar atmosphere shots in `Once Upon a Time in the West'. Also, like Peckinpah in `The Wild Bunch', there is a strong sense of inevitability in the fate of the band of outlaws lead by William Holden and Earnest Borgnine, and dialogue and scenes are taut with the tension of waiting to see how things will all play out.<br /><br />I sensed the influence of Leone as I was watching the film, and this was confirmed in a big way when I saw that several pieces of music by Enno Morricone for `A Fistful of Dollars' was used in the sound track. This confirms my sense that Tarantino shares with Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allan a great talent for borrowing music from other contexts and using it to good advantage in his movies. I was strongly reminded of scenes from the very 1960's feature length documentary `Mondo Cane' in one scene of `Kill Bill', which was no surprise at all when I saw that a piece of music was borrowed from that 40 year old movie for the scene. I really wonder if Tarantino was just lucky with one audience member, or whether he was really being that subtle in evoking a movie obscure to about 80% of his audience.<br /><br />It has been said in many reviews that the casting of David Carradine as Bill was a stroke of genius, bringing to mind his long run as a character in the TV series `Kung Fu'. I will add that Carradine does very well by the part even without that historical connection. All of the other actors execute their parts equally well, with a special kudo to Darryl Hannah for playing a really quirky scene where a large part of her monologue is read from hand-printed notes neatly written in a 3 by 5 inch spiral bound notebook. This piece of business is a small taste of the constantly different way of doing things that Tarantino pulls off better than I have ever seen it done. He does things which, if other directors try it, they take short cuts, and the business falls flat on its face. Tarantino takes no short cuts with important business. The scene between Hannah and Michael Madsen echos the overall course of the whole movie. You are certain that Hannah's character will double cross `Bud', Bill's brother played by Madsen, but you don't have a clue how she will do it. Her method, when revealed, suddenly seems incredibly obvious in the context of the movie.<br /><br />Unlike the final episode of `The Lord of the Rings', which wraps up a story spanning three movies, `Kill Bill Volume 2' can be viewed with little or no loss if you did not see `Kill Bill Volume 1'; however, one of the things which makes it so much better a movie than Volume 1 is the fact that the central plot of the two movies is resolved, and resolved with much less over the top martial arts scenes than in the first part.<br /><br />`Kill Bill Volume 2' is as good or better than any of his other movies, yet, it may not be as enjoyable to watch as `Pulp Fiction'. Key situations are equally as taut, but in spite of the `graphic novel' inspiration behind `Kill Bill', there is none of the `this is really all make believe' sense you have while watching `Pulp Fiction'. The title, after all, does give away the fact that this is storytelling. The grimness and `film noir' feeling in `Kill Bill' is accentuated by the odd red-green emphasis in the color print which I always associate with the filming of `The Matrix'. It adds to the brooding atmosphere of the movie, but I still don't like it. The recollection scenes in plain black and white are almost a relief to watch. It adds to the movie, but I could do without it.<br /><br />Like `Reservoir Dogs' and `Pulp Fiction', the time line jumps around between the main plot line and flashbacks, but every flashback is very cleverly tied into the explanation of a key plot point. While the technique gives me headaches in the hands of some directors, Tarantino has honed it to a fine edge.<br /><br />A must see movie if you like Tarantino or Peckinpah or Kurasawa or film noir. There is a lot less blood and violence than in Part I, so there may actually be less to put off squeamish viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Matt Putnam, in his Spotlight Review, writes:<br /><br />"If you're a fan of volume 1 then you should be more then satisfied."<br /><br />Apparently, most people here agree with him... but, I don't.<br /><br />Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different than Kill Bill Vol. 1.<br /><br />Vol 2, continuing the Bride's quest for revenge, is a much tamer, subdued and introspective film than the gaudy comic richness of Vol 1. The fight sequences are smaller and more "realistic" (though they still aren't realistic by any means) than in the first film; this movie is more about fleshing out the characters and their motivations and emotions. The Bride even gets a name.<br /><br />And, as they say, "your mileage may vary." Me? I preferred the styles in Volume 1. I liked the cheesy, over-the-top 70s homage, the siren-like announcements of fights (used once here, then discarded) and the anime sequence. There is one sequence in Vol 2. which I find very clever--the training with Kung Fu legend Pei Mei, which is straight out parody--but overall, Vol 2. is simply slower and longer than Vol 1.<br /><br />But, like I say: other people will really like this movie, and many will even prefer it to Vol 1. It all depends on your taste, going in.<br /><br />Despite my prefering the first part, I take comfort in the thought that these two movies kind of represent an artist's palette. Over the course of the two films, Tarantino has experimented and experimented in film genre and style, and I can only guess that these experiences will help him to develop his voice and grow in the future. In short, the kid's still learning, and I think that means that he's only going to get better, which is pretty incredible when you consider that he's already one of the best directors we have.<br /><br />It is very different than Vol. 1, and I personally wasn't completely satisfied, but still an intriguing film. Three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>In this day and age when sequels like `Matrix Reloaded' and such pollute our cinemas and ruin the glory of their predecessors I am pleased to have found a sequel worthy of its name.  `Kill Bill Vol. 2' is really less a sequel and more a continuation, but call it what you may, it still works.<br /><br />Picking up where `Vol. 1' left off we have The Bride (Thurman) exacting her revenge against the men and women that killed her friends and family, but there's a twist.  The unborn child she thought was murdered was in fact preserved.  The question remains that will her child with Bill change her plans to kill him?<br /><br />Filled with brilliant acting on all counts, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine reprising their roles as Elle and Bill, each of them doing brilliantly to bring the right amount of emotion and character to their roles, this movie is raised from action blockbuster status to Oscar caliber.  My favorite performance though is from Michael Madsen who plays Budd; a man who knows what they've done is wrong but isn't prepared to die for it.<br /><br />This film is somewhat slower than the first and focuses more on The Bride's emotional battles than her physical ones.  That doesn't by any means take away from the enjoyment received from watching this masterpiece.  A perfect companion to the first film, Tarantino and Thurman deliver a great film that will be remembered as classic for a long time to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>The Bride ( Uma Thurman) has exterminated 2 deadly cockroaches and has 3 more to go known only as Elle Driver ( Daryl Hannah), Budd ( Michael Madsen) and of course, former boss Bill ( David Carradine). She sometimes gets memories of being taught by the selfish and powerful Chinese kung-fu master Pai Mei ( Gordon Liu) and searches for her long lost daughter whom has been seperated from her womb for 4 years leading up to a battle between the man who nearly killed her 4 years ago and herself.<br /><br />Simply excellent second part of a 2-part cinematic novel done thoughtfully by masterful filmmaker Quentin Tarantino as he brings his trademark style of movies, action, snappy dialog and humor in many successful ways but less gory than it's precessor.<br /><br />The DVD just like the first movie's DVD has a few extras like Deleted scene, behind the scenes of KB vol. 2 and a look at the premire of KB Vol. 2 with a performance by Robert Rodriguez's CHINGON band and it's picture & Sound are just crystal clear.<br /><br />Add this movie with part 1 to your DVD collection if your a fan of action and cinema itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Tarantino's many, varied, and devoted fans had to get used to a slightly new Tarantino film in "Kill Bill, Vol. 1."  While Tarantino has always had a love for action sequences, most of his films were heavier on the dialogue than the fisticuffs.  Not so in "Vol. 1," which skewed much more towards the action side of the scale.  Sure, the trademark quips and pop-culture references were there, but the movie was defined by its over-the-top violence.<br /><br />"KB Vol. 2" represents a return to form for Tarantino (yes, it's an extension of the same film, but since had to pay two ticket prices, they are two films), with the dialogue once again returning to the forefront.  From the opening narrative, essentially working as the Chorus reintroducing the audience to the film after a long intermission, to several great scenes with the lethal Bill (David Carradine, in a performance that makes us wonder why we haven't seen much, much more of this guy), this film is a refreshing return to Tarantino's incredible pseudo-70's jargon and speechifying.<br /><br />Tarantino's fans are also always checking his films for references to other flicks.  Overt references include "The Searchers" in addition to homages to Tarantino's other movies, and they do not disappoint.  While Volume 1 was entertaining, I suspect that Volume 2 will receive more replays, if only because the tale is a bit more complex.<br /><br />The film does not have the audacious Japanese anime sequence used with such great effectiveness in Volume 1, but Tarantino includes an even more daring shot from inside a coffin as the occupant is buried alive (look for the exhumed corpse to play a little shadow-puppet game during the gravedigging scene).<br /><br />While Tarantino has said that he is interested in the idea of bringing back Vernita Green's daughter (from Volume 1) for a future revenge drama, I think the better chance for a spin-off character is the character who finishes the film without eyeballs.  The "Blind Swordsman" is one of the most beloved Japanese action heroes, and this character would be a perfect vehicle for Tarantino to give us his take on that legend.<br /><br />Top-notch performances abound in this film . . . Uma Thurman remains at the top of her game, the remaining survivors of DiVAS are pitch-perfect, and (again), David Carradine just plain steals the picture as an articulate, seductive, incredibly mean s.o.b.<br /><br />A must for fans of QT's previous efforts.  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, but you should buy this one for the film, not the bonus stuff.</p></br></body></html>

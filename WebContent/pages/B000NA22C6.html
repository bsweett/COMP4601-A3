He is in the middle of an ugly divorce with his wife (Bello) and he has terrible writer's block. So he goes to live in the middle of the woods in his cabin...alone...to try and write. Not with the arrival of John Shooter (Tuturro) claiming that Rainey had stolen his story, Mort's life slowly slides out of control.<p>The movie is based upon the Stephen King short story "Secret Window, Secret Garden" in his "Four Past Midnight" collection and does at times have the feel of a Stephen King novel throughout the movie. With a PG-13, the blood and gore level is not as high as some of King's other movie adaptations ("Dreamcatcher", "It", "The Shining") but there is not a lot of suspense and I called the twist 40 minutes in.<p>What Worked?<br />Well, the cast is great! Depp, Tuturro, Bello, and Dutton are all great actors and give the best performances they can. Like always, Johnny Depp ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl", "The Ninth Gate") is amazing and entertains. He really saves the movie. John Tuturro ("Mr. Deeds", "O, Brother Where Art Thou?") gave a creepy but not that menacing performance was John Shooter. Maria Bello ("Coyote Ugly", "The Cooler") gave an emotionally driven performance as Depp's soon to be ex-wife. And Charles Dutton ("Against the Ropes", "Gothika") was good as well. The cast is the high point of the film.<p>Next I loved the scenery and the music. Since the movie was not all that scary the creepy wilderness scenery and the great score by Phillip Glass ("Taking Lives", "The Hours") really made the movie a little scarier.<p>What didn't work?<br />Well... the movie was extremely predictable! I called the twist not even an hour into the movie! I was very disappointed that I was right! The way the movie looked from the trailer was a suspense filled thrill ride with action and plenty of scares. It was scary until Shooter kept showing up and making threats and then would not do anything! There could have been some freaky chase through the woods, lurking in the shadows type scenes...but there was noting like that. Shooter never jumped out of nowhere or anything, when he showed up he would just talk to Depp character!? <p>The worst part of the movie was the ending! Like I said anyone who likes murder mysteries, horror, thriller movies will be somewhat disappointed because if you know how to watch then correctly you can call this movie from a mile away! So this is a not so "secret" movie in the end. I am not going to tell you the ending because people will get mad. <p>Bottom Line:<br />I think this would be an entertaining movie to fans of Depp or anyone in the cast. Teens will flock to see this for a good scare but I recommend renting the DVD because its not that great of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I reluctantly went to see SECRET WINDOW at the urging of my younger brother.  He had seen the movie several weeks before I did and recommended that I see it if I got the chance.  So, when the film came to the local budget cinema, I made a point to watch it.  The film was everything I thought it would be and nothing more.<p>The story itself is pretty average.  Johnny Depp stars as Mort Rainey, a writer who is in the process of getting a divorce from his wife.  He loves his wife very much and really doesn't want the divorce, but she has been pressing the matter for sometime. In the meantime, Rainey has moved out of their home and is living in their summer cabin. He's been trying to finish his new book.  Unexpectedly a strange man wearing a wide-brimmed black hat shows up at his door.  The strange man calls himself John Shooter (John Turturro) and claims that Rainey stole a story from him several years ago.  Shooter wants Rainey to correct the mistake by rewriting the ending to the story.  Rainey claims that he wrote his story several years before Shooter wrote his.  Shooter gives Rainey three days to prove it to him and to show that he means business, Shooter kills Rainey's dog late at night. Thus, a game of cat and mouse begins.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't really go anywhere. The suspense doesn't build up in the right way and the ending of the movie leaves the audience longing for something more.<p>The acting in the movie is rather well done, however. Johnny Depp is almost always entertaining to watch and John Tuturro stands his ground well.  Turturro's silent, yet steady prescence serves as the perfect foil to Depp's frantic and exaggerated style.<p>Overall, the film wasn't all that bad and had some good acting, but the plot left something to be desired. SECRET WINDOW reminded me of another movie based upon a Stephen King story: THE DARK HALF.  I enjoyed THE DARK HALF more than SECRET WINDOW, but if you take the supernatural element out of THE DARK HALF you're basically left with a SECRET WINDOW.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This was a very good suspense film, and I have to say that Johnny Depp turns in another great performance. John Tuturro is great as well, and his scary hick character, Shooter, is very creepy. David Koepp is a good director and screenwriter. See STIR OF ECHOES and PANIC ROOM for good examples of this. I really liked the twist at the end, and even though you will think that you've seen it all before, you should not come out feeling disappointed with it. I thought it was extremely creepy in a very quirky way...if that makes any sense.<p>Anyways, great performances and a good script make this worth the ticket price.<p>Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I was really disappointed in this movie, as Johnny Depp seems to sleepwalk through the entire role, and shows none of his previous greatness from other roles. And the two tone hair? Not a good look.<br /><br />My dad has all of Stephen King book's but the last couple he has read, he has either struggled to get into, or found it was too similar to previous novels. I've read a couple, but watching this, I discovered every Stephen King stereotype/cliche is included. The loner eccentric writer, by himself in the middle of nowhere, the strange man - just everything about this film.<br /><br />There's also a very unexpected twist, which not only ruins what was already a mess before the twist hits, but comes so abruptly, that you have to actually pause the film and work out what on earth is going on. The 'twist' has become the most overused solutions in Hollywood in thrillers etc of the past few years, and they're getting worse, and more predictable each time. For me, the twist completely ruined this film. Other reviewers disagree.<br /><br />Maria Bello, the fabulous bar owner from Coyote Ugly, is seriously underused, and underdeveloped as a character, that it's a waste of time in even having her in the movie.<br /><br />Major disappointment. See some of Johnny's earlier films for his best work. And if you want to see something really off the wall, watch Benny & Joon.<br /><br />And on that note: "Rah! Rah! Rah!"<br /><br />Quite.<br /><br />And there was absolutely nothing 'thrilling' about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp stars as writer Mort Rainey living in seclusion in a lakefront residence in upstate New York after having been estranged from his wife Amy, played by Maria Bello.  Depp is licking his wounds from the discovery of his wife having an affair in a motel room with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton.<br /><br />The Steven King created storyline gets weird almost immediately when Depp gets an unexpected visit from Southern drawling stranger John Shooter played by John Turturro.  Turturro alleges that Depp has plagiarized a story he had written and threatens him.  In short order everything surrounding Depp begins to become destroyed.  He asks for and gets help from detective type Ken Karsch played by Charles Dutton but the tragedies keep on occuring.<br /><br />In typical King fashion, the storyline gets a jolting twist when we discover that both Depp and Turturro may not be exactly what we think they are.  "Secret Window" was an entertaining but not especially noteworthy investment of 96 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>As I sat down to watch this movie, I knew from the beginning this was adapted from a short story by Stephen King (is it me, or has Hollywood signed a contract with King agreeing to make at least one of his books or short stories into movies every other year at a BARE MINIMUM??) which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  King IS one of the most creative forces in the world of literature the world has ever known.  Some of his works are pure genius...others...pure drivel.  As 'Secret Window' began, I became quite convinced this was going to be a real treat.  Well filmed.  Suspenseful.  Well acted.  Unfortunately as the movie continued on, and the REAL reason for our main character (played wonderfully by Depp) and his problems with a redneck psychopath who is convinced his story was stolen become apparent, well I began to have flashbacks of the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />You may wonder just how in the world I can compare these two movies, huh?  Well its quite simple, actually.  Remember Gollum and his strange split-personality and how he would sometimes talk to himself and work to convince himself that the One Ring was HIS?  The portion of 'Secret Window' where Johnny Depp does the same thing kinda weirded me out, and I have to admit, made me think of Gollum right off the bat (and not just me either, my son said the same thing).  Despite this small similarity, at the point where Depp begins to interrogate himself, the entire feel of the film began to seriously deteriorate.  What WAS a fairly decent suspenseful movie suddenly became a parody of itself and almost crashes and burns.  I found the last scene to be really, really odd.  Sure, I got the whole sinister joke of it, I just found it to be very UN-funny.  Not in poor taste, just not funny.  I also found what many people thought was a very clever plot to be quite the opposite, actually.  All I can say is this: the first part of the movie was very well done.  The last part became just plain strange and un-interesting, which is sad because I really wanted to like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>&quot;Secret WIndow&quot; is a slight but entertaining little thriller best approached with lowered expectations. It's based on a Stephen King short story/novella, about a popular author accused of plagiarism by a murderous creep with an oily pallor and a dripping drawl.<br /><br /> The single reason to see this film is to catch yet another delightful performance by Johnny Depp. This guy is truly amazing...his portrayals are full of details and quirks that flesh out the characters in ways other actors can't. They try, but they always look like they're trying.<br /><br /> The supporting cast, Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton, Charles S. Dutton and a wicked John Turturro, are fine...but you really can't take your eyes off Depp. He clearly elevates the material.<br /><br /> David Koepp's script makes the most out of a difficult adaptation, and his direction is unexpectedly impressive. Inventive but always servicing the story...it's the second best thing about the film. He sets the mood, keep the atmosphere tense, surprises you here and there...<br /><br /> Give this film a chance, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>If you get the feeling you've seen this movie before it's probably because you have. In fact it was another Stephen King movie, done much better, Called, &quot;The Dark Half&quot;.<br /><br /> Oddly enough, that movie's star Timothy Hutton is a co-star in this movie. The movie stars Johnny Depp as Mort Rainey, a successful mystery writer who's holed up in his lakeside cabin trying to finish a novel even though his mind is on a messy divorce proceeding with his cheating wife (Maria Bello).<br /><br /> One day, a scary cracker (John Turturro, with a ludicrous Mississippi accent) appears on Mort's doorstep claiming the author has word-for-word stolen a story he had written years before and published it in the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.<br /><br /> He's innocent, of course, and tries to brush off the man, and even calls the police. But nothing works, and pretty soon the disgruntled amateur is stalking Mort, killing off his friends and making a most unusual demand on his literary talent.<br /><br /> Like so many Hollywood thrillers of the past decade, the movie's structure takes you along a certain path and then drops a revelation in the last act that's supposed to raise the hair on the back of your neck and force you to see the story in a whole new light.<br /><br /> But Koepp's script and direction is just not clever enough to make the trick work. The audience is way ahead of him on this one. When you add the usual thriller cliches and some graphic abuse of women and dogs to the predictability, it's altogether a bad trip.<br /><br /> Depp, who spends most of the movie in a ragged bathrobe and what looks like a blond fright wig, has some enjoyably eccentric moments as the tormented hero. But his shtick doesn't add up to a performance, and the film never kicks in as a character study or a star vehicle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>The central conceit/revelation of &quot;Secret Window&quot; isn't all that hard to guess, but the film is so well crafted (the thematic development, acting, direction, cinematography, and music is all top-notch) that you won't care.  It also helps that, while a serious effort, the film isn't full of its own importance and gets its business over with in a shade over 90 minutes.  And for those interested in such things, the extras are quite generous.  The featurettes alone clock in at over an hour when one hits the &quot;play all&quot; icon, and there's a director's commentary, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Stephen King may be the most prolific writer in the English language.  Just the number of films produced from his works is staggering.  And films made from his stories include sublime ones like "The Shawshank Redemption" and terrifying ones like "Carrie" or "The Shining". Along the way there have also been a few real stinkers like "Cujo", "Christine" and "Children of the Corn".<p>Secret Window ranks somewhere behind "Misery" in the story department, and it's easy to find comparisons between the two.  In both stories the main character is a writer - like King himself - and in both stories the writer finds himself in some remote location where they are threatened by someone who finds fault in their writing.<p>In this movie Johnny Depp's Mort Rainey is the Stephen King surrogate.  We meet his nemesis John Shooter in the first scene, where Mr. Shooter tells Mr. Rainey that he is very unhappy that Mr. Rainey has plagiarized an unpublished manuscript that Shooter has written.  Shooter is played by John Turturro as a menacing man from Mississippi with a broad-brimmed hat.<p>The suspense piles up as the threats from Shooter escalate to violence that no one in the movie thinks is under control.  At many times Rainey behaves with less sense than a teeny-bopper in Friday the 13th part gazillion, then in the final act his behavior is explained, sort of.  The ending, for some reason, reminded me of the ending of another King book/movie: Pet Sematary, and I won't give anything away by saying *why* it reminded me.  Let's just say I thought it a typical King fluorish.<p>Not a bad way to spend 2 hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I'm not the type of person to have crushes on every or some actors. But when it comes to Johnny Depp, I have a big crush on him. I didn't get a chance to see this movie in theaters, but once it came out on DVD I new I had to have it. I must say this movie is another great Johnny Depp movie. He is a great actor in it and he looks very sexy. Even when he is laying around in his ripped bathrobe. That look make's me want him even more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>I am a huge fan of both Stephen King and Johnny Depp, so it should come as no surprise that I really enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp is such a talented actor, he really makes you believe he is being driven mad. Alot of Stephen Kings fans really hate on the movies that are based on his books, I on the other hand enjoy them and many of them are really good, if they would just stop comparing them to the books and watch them for what they are ("BASED ON") they might actually enjoy them.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Shades of Hitchcock, The Shining, and various other classics pervade this movie, based on a novella by Stephen King, given life by a somewhat surprisingly cast Johnny Depp.  He is a writer, haunted by events 6 months previous, when he found his wife cheating on him, to a man she subsequently left him for.  Now he lives a life of sloth and occasional unproductive bouts of writing in his cabin in the middle of nowhere... until a mysterious man called Shooter (an excellently ambiguous John Turturro) appears with a grudge to resolve.  Shooter claims Depp stole one of his stories.  Depp's journey to prove he didn't, brings him back into the life of his estranged wife (Mario Bello) and the new man in her life.  Things get gradually weirder, and Depp starts to feel his life unravelling, even as he enlists the help of a bodyguard (Charles Dutton).<br />There's a nicely evoked sense of manufactured reality to the movie entirely in keeping with the tone of the movie.  This is noticeable for example in the use of mirrors.. through which we travel into to find ourselves in the middle of something we thought we were merely seeing a reflection of, or see something we shouldn't be able to see.  It's satisfyingly disquieting, and it's stylistic moments such as these which make the film a minor pleasure.  That, and the rather excellent cast - Depp, Turturro and Bello all characteristically bring unique life to their roles.  A Hitchockian beginning shifts in tone as the movie progresses, and the ending is telegraphed enough to be not much of a surprise to many I would imagine.. however, it's relatively entertaining getting there.  In any case, we're not asked to spend too long on the journey, the movie being edited down to the bones of the story to keep you engaged.  Good thing too, since there are holes here and the one note trick would get wearying after a while... but the ending works, regardless if you see it coming or not... and as the character says, the ending is the most important thing...<br />In Bluray, the picture is incredibly crisp and the atmospheric shots of the cabin on the lake terrific, and we can see every whisker of Depp's bizarre almost-beard.  Sounds quality adds to the odd knock and rumble here and there eliciting the occasional creepiness.  All in all, not perfect perhaps, but perfectly fine for an evening's viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>"Secret Window, Secret Garden". This is the name of the book written by Stephen King. This is what the movie Secret Window is based on. What makes Secret Window so good is that the casting was very good. Johnny Depp leads the way with an great performance. Without Depp this movie would not be as good.<br />Overall if you like suspense/thriller movies Secret Window is worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This may not be an excellent thriller, but it really was entertaining to watch. Writer and Director David Koepp gives Stephen King's novella a very nice flow and atmosphere, but it does tend to slow down in a few parts. The shocks and thrills aren't as strong as, say, the ones found in Asian horror films, but all of the gore effects make it more disturbing than shocking. The very good performances by Depp, Turturro, Bello, Dutton, and Hutton should be worthwhile to those who are about to watch this film. I won't give any details to what happens at the end; you should see for yourself.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Secret Window is a pointless whodunnit that delights in twists and turns for the sake of twists and turns; too bad the ending is a complete cliche that leaves the viewer distinctly dissapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>David Koepp ("Panic Room") wrote and directed this horror/thriller flick, an  adaptation of a Stephen King story.  Johnny Depp sinks his teeth into the role of Mort Rainey, a successful author tortured by the memory of discovering his wife's infidelity.<br /><br />Living alone in his gorgeous, rustic lake cabin, Rainey is plodding through the hum-drum writer's life (procrastination intermixed with drinking and breaking vows to stop smoking) when a mysterious stranger shows up at his front door.  John Shooter (John Turturro), who appears to be Mississippi Amish, claims that Rainey stole one of his stories, and he demands a reckoning.  It's clear from Shooter's stony gaze (and Turturro's inherent zaniness) that Rainey faces dire consequences if he does not comply.<br /><br />Is Shooter telling the truth?  Can Rainey bluff his way through, or does he have to hire some muscle (Charles S Dutton)?  And what role does Rainey's soon-to-be ex (Maria Bello) and her lover (Timothy Hutton) play in the whole mix?<br /><br />The Law of Economy of Characters, plus the knowledge that you're watching a Stephen King flick, basically gives away the creepy ending.  So you're left with the performances to keep you interested in the story.  For the most part, it succeeds, and largely due to Depp's willingness to find the  shadiest sides of his own persona.  What could have easily been a paint-by-numbers flick becomes something more interesting.<br /><br />But it must be said that this is neither King's nor Koepp's best work.  "Secret Window" is a fine purchase from the bargain bin, but only the most die-hard King or Depp fanatic will keep putting this DVD back into the player several times.</p></br><a href="../users/AKMEY1BSHSDG7.html">AKMEY1BSHSDG7</a><br/><p>I won't spoil this film for you by giving details of the script. Too much has already been revealed! What you need to know is that this is one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. The DVD is riveting, not because of King's story (which is wonderful), but because of Depp's ability to bring it to life.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp (Ed Wood, Pirates Of The Carribean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl) plays Mort Rainey to the till. This movie is based on Stephen King's story. Depp is a retired writer and who is also divorced from Maria Bello (Coyote Ugly, Tv's ER) who is seeing Timothy Hutton (The Dark Half, Beautiful Girls). At the beginning Depp finds them in the hotel. A stranger called Shooter played with real southern brass by John Tuturro (The Man Who Cried, Rounders) comes and tells Rainey he stold his story. Rainey doesnt believe him till he kills his dog. It goes on and it's serious this time and things happen and the end is just great. It has its moments Depp brings yet again another chacter to his bag of fun. Highlight would be of course Depp's secret at the end. I dont see why he had to have the braces. Charles S. Dutton (Mimic, Against The Ropes) also stars. Dutton also starred in Nick Of Time with Depp back in '95, so their old buddies. This will add good to my collection. Check it out Depp fans</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Yeah, I'm a product of that time period when people caught in a claustrophobic set freaked out and reacted. "Secret Window" is always fun, Depp is wonderful, Koepp works well with the script & direction. John Turturro, most underrated, is excellent; strong and determined. Johnny Depp never fails to entertain me. This may not be his best film, but certainly a new addition to his many personalities. There are good extras on the DVD, mostly of Koepp banging his own drum. (I liked "Stir of Echoes"...) I want to take issue that a previous reviewer said this was among the best adaptations of Stephen King. I think that Frank Darabont's adaptations of "Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile" were far superior. On the tension level, though, this works for me. (I liked Rob Reiner's "Misery", too.) I'd like to have Mr. Koepp make a coherent version of a Dean Koontz book..it hasn't happened yet. Koepp could do it.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure what this meant at first, but now it made sense to me at the end. You just really have to pay attention to the whole movie and finally, you'll figure it out. Mort Rainey is an author and one day a guy named John Shooter comes to his house and claims that Mort "stole his story". He keeps appearing and asking for the same thing and Mort knows, but he won't change the ending. Soon, everything starts getting worse. Many people think this is creepy, but I don't really think so. It sort of LOOKS creepy, but the entire story is stupendous until the end. Stephen King must've thought hard about this. It kind of reminds me of the plot of Dreamcatcher. You might not think it makes sense at the beginning, but you will if you've never seen this. Secret Window looks as though it's something to hesitate and stay away from, but it's not. It's a great story to check out in another Stephen King movie that {I don't think he directed, but probably wrote}.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>This opinion is based strictly on viewing the movie, not the bonus features of the DVD.  It's one of the few Johnny Depp DVDs I don't plan on adding to my collection as, in spite of his frighteningly good performance, it's really mediocre fare.  I kept waiting for a golden toned alto voice to inform me that I was watching, "Lifetime: Television for Women."<br /><br />Depp is so consistently good, it would be easy to take him for granted...but that's what makes him great.  He even rises above this mundane "Night Gallery" episode to make it a fun 97 minutes.  The talented supporting cast is largely wasted and most of the way you wonder if you're not watching a sequel to "Misery."<br /><br />I can't imagine the bonus features are special enough to make this one to own.  It's strictly for Depp and/or Stephen King fans and those rainy Saturday afternoons when you're curled up wanting some minor goosebumps.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Gotta hand it to this Johnny Depp guy:  the dude has some range.  From Revlon mascara in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean,&quot; Depp makes yet another fashion statement--ultimately showing that blondes do indeed have more fun--in his role as an addled, befuddled, quirky, annoying writer in the film SECRET WINDOW.<p>In fact, there wasn't much to this movie that I didn't find annoying.  The plot was tedious and anemic, as was Depp's performance as writer Mort Rainey.  And let's not forget (oh, how could we?) the persistent redneck hick, played by a backwoods-looking John Turturro, who basically has one line in this film, uttered ad nauseum:  &quot;You stole my story.&quot;  With Mario Bello playing Depp's soon-to-be ex, and Timothy Hutton in the role as the soon-to-be ex's main squeeze, we suddenly have all the ingredients for an out-of-control, over-the-top ending that comes from literally nowhere.<p>Allegedly supposed to be some sort of a thriller, SECRET WINDOW is a wet noodle devoid of even spaghetti sauce.  A reclusive writer in a cabin, stalked by a Mississippi nutcase, a bitter divorce, and then total wackiness--none of this stuff works.  At least Depp's blonde hairdo works.  I wonder if he'll be a fiery redhead in his next role?<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/ATOSQVSOA3D8Q.html">ATOSQVSOA3D8Q</a><br/><p>Although it is quite a slow film, i really enjoyed it. You have to watch it all the way through to understand it, and there is nothing scary about it even in parts there's that abit of a scare for some people. It does involve a couple of the same people over and over again and there arn't a lot of people in the film either. I won't tell you what the story is about, or i might ruin it for you. A FIRST SUSPICION FILM, THAT KIND OF CARRIES ON THROUGHOUT THE FILM. not everyone's type though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I know that I read &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden,&quot; the Stephen King novella that was the basis for David Koepp's 2004 film, but I had no conscious memory of the story when I sat down to watch the movie.  But either I remembered something deep down inside or it was a mistake to cast Timothy Hutton, who starred in movie version of King's &quot;The Dark Half,&quot; in a supporting role in this film because I quickly got to the point where I was wondering if I was reading the film wrong simply because it seemed so obvious to me what was going on.  <p>The main attraction here is Johnny Depp, because he is one actor who can be counted on never to do anything boring and whose flair for eccentricity and his devotion to odd roles is now being taken as a sign of genius.  Depp plays Mort Rainey, a writer who is out in the woods in a cabin, starring at a poorly written opening paragraph that is not getting any better.  It soon becomes clear that his writer's block is the result of the fact he is in divorcing proceedings with his wife, Amy (Maria Bello); the opening scene of the film shows us the heart of that trauma.  Struggling to deal with these twin demons Rainey is confronted by the sudden appearance of John Shooter (John Turturro), a forbidding looking figure who accuses the writer of plagiarizing a story and demands he put things to rights.<p>Mort is conflicted about his marriage and has no idea what to do with the blank sheet of paper in his typewriter.  He wants to be definite about having written the story &quot;Secret Window,&quot; but apparently in his deep dark past he plagiarized a story once and given the state he was in when he wrote the story, there just might be something about Shooter's claim.  Clearly Mort is at a crossroads where his future could well be in peril (Come on, this is a Stephen King story; this guy is toast).<p>Depp's performance is captivating.  It has to be, because he has a lot of scenes where it is just him and his blind dog or the mirror on the wall.  But do not neglect the work of screenwriter-director Koepp (&quot;Panic Room&quot;), which you are not really going to be able to appreciate until the second time you watch &quot;Secret Window&quot; (in between watch the featurettes where the director give some key insights into what he was trying to do with the film).  I would probably have liked this film more if I had gotten so far ahead of the curve, but I am still impressed with the craftsmanship of the lead actor and the director</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is a chameleon. He never seems to play the same character twice in any film. Granted, he brings many of the memorable traits of other films into each of his performances, but he's never boring. Depp is the main reason to see SECRET WINDOW. He plays writer Mort Raney, a somewhat successful author, who is going through the pains of an impending divorce. One day, a stranger knocks at his door and accuses Mort of stealing his short story, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What a strange man...in a Quakerish style hat, with a rich Southern drawl, and cold, clinical eyes. John Turturro is wonderful in this role, bringing an inevitable demonic presence into Depp's tortured life.<br /><br /> Although the outcome may be apparent, it doesn't really hit you until the director David Koepp wants it to. Depp's performance is great, including his habit of cracking his jaws whenever things get a little nervous. Maria Bello and Timoth Hutton as his estranged wife and her lover perform adequately, but they are really more plot tools than characters. Charles Dutton, likewise, isn't given a whole lot to do, but his presence is commanding. Veteran character actor Len Cariou is also good in his role as the local sheriff.<br /><br /> SECRET WINDOW is a quietly suspenseful movie; it's not really a &quot;scary&quot; movie, but more of an intense portrayal of a man's descent into madness. Depp was perfect for the role.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp, outspoken critic of `freedom fries' (`I was ecstatic they re-named 'French Fries' as 'Freedom Fries.' Grown men and women in positions of power in the U.S. government showing themselves as idiots.'), has certainly had long and colorful career, but I'll always remember him a Glen Lutz from his very first film A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).  His popularity seemed to wan a bit, that was until he appeared in the blockbuster hit Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and is set to also appear in the following sequels, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), and Pirates of the Caribbean 3 (2007).  Somewhere in there he managed to find time to star in this film, Secret Window (2004), one of four films he appeared in during 2004.  The film, based off a Stephen King story entitled `Secret Window, Secret Garden', was written and directed by David Koepp (Stir of Echoes), and, along with Depp, stars John Turturro (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), and Maria Bello (Payback).  Also appearing is Timothy Hutton (The Dark Half), Charles S. Dutton (Mimic), and Len Cariou (About Schmidt).<br /><br />Depp plays Mort Rainey, a writer who's not only suffering from a mild case of writers block (and usually a wicked case of the bed head), but is also knee deep in divorce proceedings with his estranged wife Amy (Bello).  Seems Mort found Amy in the arms (and bed) of another man named Ted (Hutton), and this prompted their separation (apparently their marriage had been suffering for some time, and Amy's liaison was the point when they decided to call it quits)...but the divorce has yet to be finalized, due to Mort dragging his feet on signing the papers.  In line with the saying that `when it rains, it pours', Mort also finds himself accused of plagiarism by a hillbilly sort named John Shooter (Turturro), who turns out to be more than just your garden variety nut job, as he begins stalking Mort, leaving ominous messages and threatening even worse if Mort doesn't `make things right' (Mort claims to have proof that he didn't steal the story, as it was published in a magazine some years before Shooter claims to have written his).  So not only does Mort have his wife and her somewhat greasy boyfriend to deal with (they're pushing him to sign the papers), but Shooter keeps upping the stakes, presenting Mort with little mementos regarding the ever increasing serious nature of his intent.<br /><br />Without actually giving away the nature of the story, specifically the characters, I will say I've seen similar aspects of this story before.  It's not that I necessarily recognized the elements as they were presented, but about halfway through I sort of knew where we were headed.  The interesting thing is how writer /director Koepp decided to `let the cat' out of the bag, in particular with the slow build up and relatively quiet realization (about three-quarters of the way in), rather than a more sensational revelation near the end (he describes his reasoning for this, and many other choices, in one of the featurettes).  I thought it was a nice twist.  While I did find some of the elements predictable, the film was still fun and entertaining to me based on the performances, scripting, and well thought out direction.  I enjoyed Depp's character a lot, and I thought he did a good job bringing Mort to life, infusing him with all kinds of humanizing mannerisms and an overall realistic tone.  I thought Turturro's character was a little off in the beginning (not the psychological make up of the character himself, but the performance) as his southern drawl distracted me a little bit, but I did get used to it, and given the true nature of the character, it worked (I still think the choice of a different actor for this part may have worked better, but that's neither here nor there).  Maria Bello...I'm not especially particular to blondes (I like them brunettes), but I've always found her pleasing to watch, not only as an actress but also as a hot babe.  I think she did relatively well, even if her role wasn't often as well defined as I thought it should have been, but perhaps this was the intent as we are supposed to focus our attention on Depp's character, and the fact that he was on the short end of the relationship stick.  I thought the direction was very well done, as Koepp certainly knows how to relate a story and get a desired effect from the audience, that audience being myself.  He used a lot of literal interpretations within the film (they not always obvious when first presented) and I was sort of on the fence about this aspect, but then I remembered one of Depp's previous films, The Ninth Gate (1999), by Roman Polanski, and how much trouble I had picking up on the subtle, sometimes completely obscure, concepts presented there, and found myself comfortable in the fact I didn't have to exert my brain as much here as I did there.  I don't mind films with ambiguous stories, open to all kinds of interpretation, but some directors can take it too far, forgoing the audience's enjoyment for the sake of their own, bizarre conceptualizations (in terms of Polanski, I've found I either really like his films like Chinatown, or I'm completely annoyed by them as in The Ninth Gate.<br /><br />The wide screen (2.40:1 aspect ratio) looks really good on this DVD, as the colors are rich and vibrant, along with clear definition between the light and the dark.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is also excellent, and comes through clear.  There are a number of extras on this DVD including three featurettes (From Book to Film, A Look Through It, and Secrets Revealed), Animatics (animated storyboards), a director's commentary, four deleted scenes (two with directors commentary), and a number of previews for other Columbia/Tristar releases.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>I was really hoping that this movie was going to be good.  I really wanted this movie to be good.  Maybe I just set my standards too high.  I mean sure Johnny Depp is in the movie, (and carried the whole movie, again) but how many horror movies like these are really good?  This movie makes one less.<p>This movie had a ton of flaws.  I can't really tell what they are without ruining the "surprise" ending.  Just take my word that there were many flaws.  SPOILER ALERT:  The ending was very similar to Idenity and I really do not like those endings.  Maybe because I can't understand how it is all possible, if you've seen Identity you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />The movie moved very slowly and the thing that I was most disappointed in was the fact that the movie just wasn't scary at all.  I was laughing at Depp's antics more than I was feeling frightened at plot developments.  <p>There were a few things that I liked.  I like the way the movie ended, not the surprise ending, but the way the story ended.  Mainly because it is something that you rarely see in movies.  Also Depp was very entertaining.  I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars, but I like Johnny Depp so I will give it three.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Though short, Secret Window still felt dragging at times. Its a weird type of movie where nothing really makes sense yet you know exactly what is going to happen less than halfway thru. Nothing is really a surprise here. I don't even know what genre to categorize this film into. Its not a horror nor was it really suspenseful. Its just sort of an annoying and unnecessary film, lacking in charisma and a real plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp Stars as Mort Rainey, a semi-famous author living in the mountians as a sort of shelter from his (pending) ex-wife who cheated on him in a hotel with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton, her current fiance (also understandably,... pending). Very soon after the movie begins we meet John Shooter, an angry and very eccentric Mississppi man who is led to believe that Mort plagerized one of his beloved stories, "Secret Window" (what a suprise!),. Conflicts rise, animals are killed, people get mangled with screw drivers while others get diced with axes. You get the picture if you have seen a few horror or thriller films. The movie though is more of a guessing game for the first hour or so but in the end lies a twist, dont get to excited because the twist is actually quite common in films nowadays ... but overall all very good acting makes veiwers to believe that the film is actaully better than it is. The story is based on a Stephen King novel. The screenplay is really not hat great same goes for the directing, but overall I found the film to be somewhat convincing and overall pretty good with the ending. Though the ending might be some what confusing, if you were paying attention than you should understand everything just fine. Johnny Depp gets right down within the "Depp-th's" of the film and is really convincing. John Turtorro's performance as the bad guy (John Shooter) is also really good.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good horror film than this is not for you, it's PG-13, very low on blood and not at all scary, BUT the film his more than it's share of sheer suspense and is a pretty good, involved thriller.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>This movie is full of suspense and thrills.

Enter John Shooter (John Turturro), a mysterious man from Mississippi who shows up at Rainey's cabin door one day. Shooter claims that Mort has stolen his story and begins threatening him and making demands. Rainey slowly realizes that this guy is very unstable and quite dangerous, especially after Shooter performs some shocking animal cruelty on Rainey's pooch. Things get increasingly worse, escalating into murder and madness. Can Rainey prove that he didn't steal this maniac's story? Well, it's just not that simple! There's more to this than your typical stalker / madman flick. As the tale unfolds, we get small clues as to what's really going on. SECRET WINDOW is a solid thriller with some nice twists and turns (in a "sixth sense" / "the others" sort of way). I found the whole thing both entertaining and creepy. Johnny Depp is great, proving once more that he can play any role he's given, no matter how strange. Cheers...</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Adapting Stephen King into movies has been a risky thing. It's a hit and miss affair, with plenty more misses than hits here lately with the last few film adaptions of his stories and novels. They are still never less than interesting. And so, we have another film adaption of a short story by King, this one from "Secret Window, Secret Garden". Writer David Koepp writes the story into a pretty good screenplay, emphasizing on subtle tricks and pacing. Johnny Depp stars in the film as Mort Rainey, A grungy, near divorced author with wild hair who keeps to himself in his rustic old cabin in the woods near a beautiful lake. The opening of the film immediatley fills you in on why Mort has gotten to this stage, and why he is living in this secluded cabin. Trying to knock out another story, Mort is quickly confronted by a Mississippi man named John Shooter(eerily played by John Turturro), who claims that Mort plaigarised his "Secret Window" story, and is now out to seek that wrongs be turned into rights. It is quickly obvious that Mr. Shooter is not a well man, and his demeanor quickly turns psychotic and dangerous. Mort swears he wrote his story first, and sets out to prove this fact to Shooter before this strange man causes him, or anyone else, more harm. All at the same time that Mort is going thru an unhappy divorce with his wife Amy(Maria Bello), and her current boyfriend Ted(Timothy Hutton)is sticking his nose in. Charles S. Dutton is along for the ride as a lawyer friend of Mort's who is out to help him with Shooter. Len Cairou also co-stars as the local town sheriff. Isn't there always a local town sheriff in stories like these?. The movie hangs on Depp's every move. Every word. Every action. It's a small cast and it is all basically up to him, because he is in every scene, and a lot of the time it's just him alone. But this is Johnny Depp. It can be garbage, and he will still own every scene. Fortunatley for us, Mort Rainey is an interesting character. Another eccentric in Johnny's long catalogue of eccentric characters that he is a master at. It may not be as big or splashy or memorable as most of his other roles, but Depp infuses enough distinct personality, presence, and tics into Mort, that he is a full fleshed character that carries the entire film from start to finish. Not sure if I liked the hair yet or not. Turturro has always been a great actor, and his portrayal of Shooter is one of immense unease. With this southern drawl, big hat, and laid back ease, his John Shooter is a strange and memorable man. He brings the right balance of meance and humor, without overdoing it. Any time I see Turturro now, I will be seeing and hearing John Shooter. The rest do with what they have. Hutton, who starred in the King film "The Dark Half", is pretty much stuck in the "new boyfriend is a jerk and how can I get rid of him?" role. He's just fine, but it's a role with little in the way of a rewarding outcome. Maria Bello pretty much has the same fate. She does well with the material, but her role pretty much becomes nothing more than the ex turned damsel in distress. Dutton, who is always a likeable and strong presence, doesn't fare much better, but his being there alone elevates the movie. The film moves along at a pretty slow pace. It's not a slam bang type of a rush thriller. It plays it slowly, and lets it all seep in and build. Some may see the ending coming. Some may not. Some may think it's a disappointing cop out, while others see it as a fitting and interesting end. Whichever way you see it, it pretty much works. I was not necessarily shocked with the outcome, but I definitley didn't expect some of the events that did happen in the finale. It's not a really great movie, just a pretty good one. Not the best Stephen King adaption either, but better than a lot of his movie adaptions of late. But this is Johnny's movie, and he does another fine job that makes the movie better than what it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>By about a half hour into "Secret Window," I had pretty much figured out what was really happening and where the story was heading.  That's not usually a good sign when it comes to films of this type, but "Secret Window" still manages to be a fairly efficient psycho/stalker thriller, even with its painfully obvious triple-somersault-with-a-double-back-flip ending.<br /><br />Based on a Stephen King work, the film stars Johnny Depp as a writer named Morton Rainey, a character we may assume is not too far removed in some ways from the author himself.  One day, Rainey is approached by a mysterious stranger from Mississippi (John Turturro) who accuses the writer of having plagiarized one of his stories (published by Rainey under the title "Secret Window").  Despite Rainey's protests of innocence in the matter, the man, who calls himself "Shooter," starts making life miserable for the young author, who is already struggling with a messy divorce from the wife (Maria Bello) he caught cheating on him in a nearby motel.<br /><br />Thrillers like "Secret Window" always seem to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to working out their storylines.  Modern audiences have developed such an insatiable appetite for ever more elaborate plot twists and surprise turnabout endings that the writers of these films end up having to compromise narrative plausibility to satisfy the demand.  As a result, like most thrillers these days, "Secret Window" starts off well then goes steadily downhill, as the plot elements begin to spin more and more out of control and credibility flies out the window.<br /><br />For a good part of the time, "Secret Window" is fun to watch, as Depp tries to figure out what it is that this enigmatic stranger really wants.  Although the red herrings are not always totally effective, they do occasionally divert us off the tried-and-true path along which the story is traveling.  The film is at its best when dealing with the tensions between Rainey, his wife, Amy, and her current lover, Ted, played by Timothy Bottoms.  The actors bring a human dimension to what is, after all, a pretty soulless exercise in audience manipulation.  Turturro has a fun time hamming it up with his cornpone Southern accent, although he still manages to come across as a threatening and menacing figure from time to time.<br /><br />There's a small window hidden behind a piece of furniture that may or may not hold the key to everything, but it is so confusingly handled in the screenplay that the audience is left scratching its head trying to figure out what it all means. Indeed, that is the biggest shortcoming of the movie's final act; besides being silly, implausible and way over-the-top, it doesn't make the connections it needs to in order for us to understand what's really going on.  It's all a game of a thriller, but a game that fails to lay down the rules in a fair enough way so that we in the audience can play along as well.  As a result, we feel very much cheated and had by the time the closing credits come crawling by.  So, if you go into "Secret Window" with your eyes open and your credibility meter shut off, you may wind up enjoying the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is an author going through a difficult divorce. He retreats to his secluded country home to work on a new book. One day, he is jolted from sleep by a stranger at his door. This man, named John Shooter (John Turturro), claims that Mort has plagiarized a short story that he wrote. Mort denies the accusation, claiming that he wrote the story first and can prove it. But John Shooter is determined to exact revenge.<br /><br />"Secret Window" is based on Stephen King's story "Secret Window, Secret Garden", published in his 1990 collection "Four Past Midnight". The story was adapted for the screen and directed by David Koepp. Koepp does an admirable job of manipulating the audience, creating suspense, and surprising us. Johnny Depp is perfect in the role of this slightly eccentric, suddenly spooked writer. John Turturro gives the most memorable performance of the film as the monotone, obsessed, menacing villain. I wouldn't have pictured Turturro in the role of a country bumpkin. It just goes to show the breadth of his talent. I thoroughly enjoyed "Secret Window". It looks good. The story is solid and layered. Director David Koepp is creative, clever, and has a great sense of timing.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include four deleted scenes, three featurettes, "Animatics", and an audio commentary from director David Koepp. "From Book to Film" is a documentary featuring interviews with David Koepp and the film's cast. The first 10 minutes of it basically just recap the film. Then there is some discussion of casting and filming. I wouldn't bother with this one. "A Look Through It" is a better documentary. 30 minutes long, David Koepp talks about the decisions he made shooting key sequences in the film, such as the opening hotel sequence and shooting inside the cabin. "Secrets Revealed" is a 13-minute documentary discussing the final 15 minutes of the movie. If you're really interested, these last two documentaries are the ones to watch. "Animatics" shows what are essentially animated storyboards for four scenes in the film. There is no narration or explanation. I had already heard too much commentary from the director to want to listen to the film's audio commentary, so I can't comment on that except to say that director David Koepp is interesting and well-spoken, so you might want to give the commentary a try if an hour's worth of featurettes haven't satisfied you. Subtitles are available in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>There's no question that Johnny Depp is one of the greatest actors alive today, if not ever. He's that kind of actor that can make any movie worth watching. Such is the case with SECRET WINDOW, the latest adaptation of a Stephen King story (I really wish they would stop; only a handful of King movies were really good, anyway . . . . the rest were horrible). Johnny Depp's performance in this movie is absolute dynamite, and I think one of his best. It's even better than his fun-yet-vastly-overrated performance in PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN (I mean, he was good, but he got his first Oscar nod for THAT?!) Depp creates a character in SECRET WINDOW that is truly memorable and realistic, capturing both the sorrow and humorous quirks that a reclusive writer probably would have.<br /><br /> That said, aside from marvelling at Depp's seemingly endless acting abilities, there's not much to see here. The story is fairly interesting, and might even have been really good, if not for the ending. I mean, I saw this coming half-way through the movie, so I was hardly surprised at all. (Let's just say that anyone who has seen A BEAUTIFUL MIND will easily guess the ending.) I mean, at least they could have made it more scary! I slightly jumped twice, and that was it. Luckily, it's a short movie.<br /><br /> Well, in any case, fans of Johnny Depp are definitely going to want to see this flick. After all, thanks to him, the story actually holds your attention. Without him, however, I'd say that this is one of the most derivative excuses for a &quot;horror&quot; movie or &quot;thriller&quot; that I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>eThis movie really kept me guessing, and guessing is always fun while you're in a dark movie theater, your eyes becoming more glued to the screen with every frame and your fingers clutching the seat with anxiousness. This movie will certainly do this for you. It's a true blast, and Johnny Depp is amazing as usual. He really has a knack for playing the offbeat character-- perhaps because he himself is offbeat, but in a way that makes you want to see more.<p>Depp stars as Mort, a writer with a severe case of writer's block. He takes long naps, talks to his dog, sits at his computer hoping to write something other than "bad writing," which he won't even bother with. If it's bad, he deletes it. There is no editing. So along comes John Shooter (Turturro) who claims that Mort stole a story of his who leaves behind his manuscript for Mort to look over. Mort is dismissive at first, but soon discovers that Shooter could be more of a problem than what he first thought. <p>Did Mort really steal the story? Nah, and don't worrry-- my mentioning this is not really a spoiler. There's a bit of backstory in this movie with Mort's estranged wife and her new boyfriend and how Mort is coping with the fact that his wife is sleeping with someone other than her husband. I like that this movie is full of mystery, but isn't so twisted that you're not sure what's going on... well, until the end that is. <p>This movie had an ending that I wasn't so thrilled with, and perhaps you may agree with me on it after you actually see the movie because I refuse to give away the twist ending. It's typical. That's all I'll say. (You may disagree-- I'm sure lots of people will like the ending, and I'll bet this is a movie that some people may see more than once, just to catch all those things they might have missed throughout it the first time.)<p>I still give this movie five stars. Not only is Depp fantastic, as he always is, but even though I didn't really like the ending, I was NOT expecting it, and I can truly appreciate that. I love it when it's unexpected, and I'm sure audiences will have their mouths covered in amazement when the final revelation happens. <p>This movie is definitely worth the few dollars to see at the movies. But don't get popcorn. You might not want it as the movie progresses. It freaked me out in some spots to the point where my stomach was in knots, but in a good way-- in the way any thrilling movie should do. I did like that it carried a quirky tone as well, it definitely suits Johnny Depp. His mannerisms and some of his lines and predicaments will make anyone laugh. So see it, you're bound to like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Take Johnny Depp, a movie star with fine acting abilities as well as box office draw.

If you like scary movies, this is a winning combination. <p> <p>Johnny Depp is cast as a writer who is living in what he refers to as a cabin but is, in reality, what many people would consider an ideal rustic vacation home.

All of the sudden the doorbell rings.  Standing there is John Turturro, dressed in a black suit with a large brimmed black hat.  In a deep southern accent Turtorro accuses Depp of stealing his story. He even leaves his manuscript, which Depp soon realizes is the exact same story that he published several years before.  Turtorro starts to menace Depp.  It's all very frightening, especially since the atmosphere of the story is planned to have the utmost of tension.<p> <p>As the story unfolded I was completely drawn in, but a small part of me was impatient with the outcome.  Knowing this was originally written by Stephen King gave me a hint of the ending.  The plot thickens as the wife, played by Maria Bello and her boyfriend, played by Timothy Hutton, enter the story.  There's one scary moment after the other with no explanation.  There are several acts of violence, which intensify as the story progresses.  But by the ending, however, I wasn't surprised.  It's not a pleasant ending and left me with a rather hollow feeling.<p> <p>This certainly isn't a "feel good" movie and, even though the conclusion is satisfactory, it wasn't a conclusion I wanted.

Little did I know that the preview had all the good parts.<br /><br />The movie itself did little for me. It was pretty straight-forward through most of it, nothing terrific, nothing unexpected. Man shows up at door claiming Mort (Depp's character) plagiarized him. The man turns out to be a psycho, or so we think.  Things get a little more interesting when Mort starts thinking that maybe his estranged wife's new boyfriend might be behind everything, that he might have sent this psycho after Mort in the hopes of speeding up the divorce but things have gotten out of control. Mort even confronts the boyfriend about it. Their conversation does not fit into the twist near the end of the movie, however. In fact, nothing fits in to the twist.<br /><br />This is a film with a secret, something we understand pretty soon. I will not reveal it, but most people will come up with an idea and find out they are right. Even though it has a secret it plays too much like a lot of thrillers we have already seen.  This is a film for Stephen King and Johnny Depp's fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Oh, my, my, my, my.  Johnny Depp in a quirky role.

It is a war between Depp and Turturro of who's the better author, even if you don't really like this film, I know your going to love Depps performance. It is a really shocking thriller, which will leave you on the edge of your seat.  <p>This movie is based on the novel by Stephen King, and you know all the movies based on Stephan Kings novels are amazing, like Pet Cementary, Misery, It, The Shining, Carry and other movies based on Stephen King. And you know the movies based on his novels are sure to be shocking thrillers! This is one of those movies where you have to watch it again and again to actually get it. These performances are really great.  John Turturro plays his character so well, he can actually just creep you out like if his character was real. This film has really great cinematography. The movie is really confusing at first, that's really the reason you need to watch it again and again. It will keep you guessing from end to beginning. This movie can make you jump out of your seat, when you walk out of the theater you will just be blown away out of the movie. This is truly, a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Poor Mort Rainey! The famous novelist (played effortlessly by Johnny Depp, who earns this wreck its single star) is holed up in his Maine retreat, reeling from his wife's adultery, on the cusp of a brutal divorce, and battling one Grendel of a writer's block.<br /><br />And don't you know, when it rains, it pours: right in the middle of his nap, a furious stranger in a broad-brimmed hat comes rap-rap-rapping at his Chamber Door, accusing the befuddled novelist of "stealing his story". Would I sit through this shipwreck of a snorefest again? Quoth John Shooter: "Nevermore".<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to this flick; it had all of the promising ingredients for a spooky little potboiler. It's based on the Stephen King's novella "Secret Window, Secret Garden", which is an intimate and nasty tale of obsession and madness and one of the juiciest in King's "Four Past Midnight". It has Johnny Depp, who can charm the camera with a quirky frown, and John Turturro, equally adept at eccentric roles.<br /><br />Director David Koepp made his directorial debut with the stylish "Stir of Echoes", while Director of Photography Fred Murphy obviously knows how to wield a camera: he turned out the masterfully moody camera-work in "Mothman Prophecies". "Secret Window" even has Philip Glass doing the stress-inducing soundtrack.<br /><br />And certainly the movie starts on the right note: we see Johnny Depp hunched in the driver's seat of a car, toboggan pulled down over his maniac locks, scowling face a-twitch, a snowstorm howling outside the car window.<br /><br />All good stuff, made even more tantalizing when we shift forward six months after the intro's wicked little revelation: now we're holed up in a spooky cabin on equally spooky lake, with a devoted dog, tormented writer, disintegrating marriage, and crazy on the doorstep.<br /><br />What's not to love? Nearly everything.<br /><br />If the synopsis I've given you sounds intriguing, then pick up a copy of Stephen King's "Four Past Midnight" and read the very creepy story. Unless you're a hardcore Depp fanatic, a masochist, or an insomniac, you'll get no pleasure from this one-way ticket to Dullsville.<br /><br />Koepp gives us no suspense, no tension, no momentum, no scares, certainly no horror. "Secret Window" is strictly by the numbers, and twenty minutes into the thing it felt like all hands aboard the project---with the exception of the inventive Depp---had lost interest.<br /><br />The direction is dull, the pace plodding, the camerawork listless and strictly point-and-shoot, and worse still, the film's aimlessness seems to infect the actors.<br /><br />The usually interesting Timothy Hutton's (adulterer Teddy) mystifying inclusion merely serves as a reminder of just how good---relatively speaking---the similarly themed "The Dark Half" really was.<br /><br />The charismatic Charles Dutton (Ken Karsch) is wasted in a role (big, bearish, overconfident P.I.)that was stale back in "Thinner" and "Cape Fear": he goes through the motions and cashes a check. Maria Bello (Amy) does her best work accompanied by a side order of corn. John Turturro (Shooter)lets the hat do the acting.<br /><br />It's not that "Secret Window" is a howlingly horrible movie---if Koepp had taken some chances, played with the movie, let Depp's natural charisma percolate through the rest of this mummified corpse of a movie, the thing might have had some quirky cult appeal. No hope for the patient, alas: the film is delivered on the slab smelling of formaldehyde and stinking of rot.<br /><br />That said, at the very least, "Secret Window" really made me empathize with poor crazy old John Shooter. Shooter claimed Rainey had stolen his story, he wanted it back, and he was out for blood. Same with me: "Secret Window" stole my 90 minutes, I want it back, and I'm out for blood.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Secret Window: 5 out of 10: I am not going to critique Johnny Depp. He is fine in this movie. And I certainly do not want the great wrath of woman, of various ages, down upon my head. Johnny Depp is a thespian God. He can do no wrong. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory never existed... (God he was awful in that.)<br /><br />Depp's performance is the most entertaining thing is Secret Window. In fact with the exception of a wonderfully drawn Timothy Hutton in a supporting role, it is the only entertaining thing in the movie. The small cast is rounded out by Maria Bello (A 41 year old butterface that plays Depp's, cuckolding, bitchy, soon to be ex-wife) and the usually dependable John Turturro who is a disaster.<br /><br />This is a Stephen King adaption about a writer going over the edge. (If you saw The Dark Half which also starred Timothy Hutton this will definitely feel like familiar ground). The plot is a familiar train wreck. Depp is a writer going through a nasty divorce and suffering from writers block. There is a knock at the door and Turturro is at the door. With a southern drawl and an Amish tailor Turturro claims that Depp stole his story and has to make it right.<br /><br />Ah plagiarism, that old plot twist standby which many a great horror novel is based on. (Or maybe not). Turtorro's character quickly becomes a nasty bit of work as he kills Depp's beloved dog with a screwdriver. (This isn't really a plot spoiler. This is a Steven King adaptation, there are no kids in it to kill and the beloved dog might as well have been dressed in a metaphorical red shirt from the first scene.)<br /><br />This is where the movie officially lost me. Turturro is about as threatening as a Joe Pesci romantic comedy and if his character (named Shooter) killed one of my family members the next time he entered my property he would be renamed shot.<br /><br />But the movie cannot let Depp kill Shooter... cause of a super secret plot twist so lame and so obvious that it's no wonder plagiarism was at the forefront of the writer's mind. To add insult to injury the movie actually feels it needs to drop hints at this shocking plot twist apparently under the assumption a portion of the audience sniffs glue for a living and didn't figure it out within 10 minutes of the opening credits.<br /><br />The only real surprise in the entire film is the strange Children of the Corn references (Turtorro's character seems to be clearly channeling Malachi and the last scene is torn right from that mid-eighties classic.)<br /><br />Perhaps the film is meant to be homage to the fine Children of the Corn series... No greater faint praise could I imagine damning with.</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp's ability as an actor is key to making this one a well-done adaptation of the Stephen King multiple personality disorder psycho-thriller.  Like many King stories, this one is not so much the terror but the depth of the story that gives it it's appeal.  It is an aspect difficult to capture on film, as opposed to print, but still succeeds in this case.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>The dire results of plagiarism cannot get any worse in this taut thriller, adapted from a story by the modern master of terror, Stephen King. Johnny Depp's performance as an author of some renown, the cuckold husband in the midst of a sticky divorce, attempting to write again, is a smooth mixture of light comedy, witty one-liners and an experienced sense of the dramatic, rendered with unconscious precision. This popular American actor is at the top of his form because he makes it look so easy.<br /><br />When this picture first hit the big screen, practitioner-critics from around the world agreed that it had the potential to be a very good film, but settled for something much less. The problem, they believed, was an identity problem: it couldn't decide whether to be a dramatic comedy or a serious thriller - it attempted to achieve both and failed on all counts. It was said as well that Depp is the film's only saving grace, and without his name and talent, its box office run should not have lasted more than a few days. I couldn't disagree more. Depp's performance certainly carried the film along, but the overall editing, creative and tight, and the soundtrack by Phillip Glass, reminiscent of old Hitchcock films, provided enough atmospheric suspense to ensure the audience remained riveted from start to finish.<br /><br />Secret Window did not set out to be original, reach any box office records or change the face of filmmaking. It is simply a good story, adapted to the screen for the single purpose to entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously nor did the filmmaker's intend it to be taken as such. Depp appeared to have a good time making the film and a lot of us had a good time watching it, too. Well worth the time and few bucks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Let it be known that Secret Window is as predictable as thrillers get and would usually be a movie I despise. Then why didn't I? For one, Secret Window is very well-made; creepy and effective and wonderfully shot. Johnny Depp is superb as always, and is joined by a great cast, which includes the beautiful Maria Bello, John Turturro, Charless Dutton, and Timothy Hutton.<br /><br />The suspense manages to build, slowly and steadily, to a very creepy, but predictable and unsatisfactory conclusion. Some may guess the twist long before the end credits, but even so, it's a chilling denouement and guaranteed to keep you in suspense until the somewhat ambiguous ending.<br /><br />All the performances are solid and the entire film makes an atmospheric use of handsome woodland and lakeside settings. Johnny Depp is an incredibly versatile actor and never disappoints with a performance. John Turturro does a memorable job as the man claiming to be the true author and Timothy Hutton is effective as the man who has stolen the affection of Depp's ex-wife. Mario Bello isn't given much to do but she is perfect as Depp's ex-wife and Charles Dutton never gives a bad performance. All of the proceedings are enhanced by Phil Glass' subtle background score.<br /><br />Overall, the film is well worth watching if you're a fan of Johnny Depp and enjoy a good mystery with a not so shocking twist.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp plays a writer who is in the throes of a divorce from a wife who cheated on him with another man.  He lives alone in a cabin on a lake where he is visited by a man named Shooter who accuses him of plagiarism.  Depp claims that he can prove that this accusation is false, but in the meantime bad things begin to happen to him which he attributes to Shooter.

Shooter wants things rectified by Rainey and wants what is "right is right".From here it is a game of cat and mouse as Rainey promises to obtain proof that his story is genuine and his own so that the evil and enigmatic Shooter will go way and leave him alone.Easier said than done as a chain of complicated matters and violent events plunge and pull Depp's character into the madness created by Shooter. Seems that Shooter has made one stipulation that if Rainey does not follow through with or comply, his refusal will only make matters worse for him and those around him---especially for his wife whom he is going through the painful proceedings of a divorce process. Acts of animal cruelty, bizarre murders (body count starting to rise around central character)with everything pointing towards the menacing and mysterious Shooter...<p>I've never read the Stephen King story on which this film is based on so you won't get any "love it" or "hate it" comparisons from me between the book and film. There were quite a few obvious clues in the beginning of the film that pretty much gave away the "surprise" twist for me.There was a definite sense of predictability.Low and behold the movie's twist and ending is exactly the way I had envisioned it. I have seen this done so many times before in other previous movies using the same surprise premise. Was I disappointed? You bet.<p>The only reason for the 4 stars is the outstanding performances by Depp , Dutton and Turturro! Johnny's in familiar role acting territiory as the tortured central character who possesses that sharp sarcastic "right-back-at-ya-buddy" wit and hard edged cynicism that only Depp can do extremely well in his performances!He takes no crap.Period.A fine actor that never disappoints;you can literally see his creative wheel spinning in his head as he plays the role with great verve.<p>Charles S. Dutton's character was a bit underrated and could have used more film time as well as dialogue.Nevertheless, a great performance. Turturro as the mysterious and maniacal "Shooter" is an actor that can play such an evil role yet there is always something comedic in nature to his performance that adds that something to his sinister role.<p>For those who have seen the dvd with the alternate ending, THAT is the ending I would have used for true Stephen King style and atmosphere !<p>See Secret Window for a Saturday night at home flick and for the outstanding preformances by Depp, Tururro and Sutton but don't be shocked if you can figure out the twist from early on in the film !</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Secret Window is a great film, loaded with so many well-directed scenes I wished it had been a longer movie.  The movie is based on a Stephen King novel (Four Past Midnight - Secret Window - Secret Garden), and while I haven't read that novel, this movie has convinced me to do just that.<p>Depp is a master at getting inside the role he plays, and being a writer myself, and having a lot of writer-friends, I can tell you that Depp did a great job portraying a successful writer in this movie.  But Depp fans are used to him delivering the goods, aren't they?  Yes would be the correct answer... <p>It is Johnny's little quirks and piffy comments, that one would swear had to be Depp's own toss-ins, which make this movie so easy to love.  When the young woman at the post office tells him he looks pale and he responds, "thanks", the dialogue flowed so well it seemed like a camera man had caught the two just having a daily conversation without them knowing they were being filmed; now that's acting.<p>The plot is great.  I didn't have a hard time figuring out where the movie was taking me, but it managed to make a figured-out-early-plot still ride quite nice.

So don't be mad at the movie just get used to it.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Did you like the movie 'Identity' where there is like one and half hours of an absolutely fantastic setup only to have John Cusack turn into Uncle Fester in the end? Well it seems that Hollywood has yet again decided that another run at this copout would be a good idea - great premise, excellent setup and throw in the old totally unrealistic psycho split-personality twist that the story is all in some sick persons head... hell even rip the ending of The Shining "Redrum" for good measure. Is that what you want after investing 90 minutes of your time? Do you really believe in the 21st century that people have this split-personality disorder? It is about as realistic as just throwing a three-eyed alien into the movie and saying that it was the cause of it all.<br /><br />It is true that Secret Window has an excellent premise - an author, going through a divorce, living out in the country, in the middle off writer's block, meets a stranger who claims that he stole his story and then the stranger proceeds to make the writer's life a misery by killing and harming everyone around him... all because the writer stole his story, a story that our protagonist claims he wrote himself. Interesting yes, but the fact that the ending is just so lame makes it all totally worthless, however this movie does have some good points in that the final last scene is not that bad, the dialogue is quite witty throughout and both lead actors - Depp and Turturro are on flying form... but all is marred by a rehash of the stupid ending we got in Identity. How they could do this once in the 21st century is incredible given that some young talented directors can hardly get a greenlight for their next ORIGINAL project. Doing it twice just shows how terrible the whole system is. Boycott this type of garbage and watch it when it comes to television. Everyone should have known better.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp and John Turturro are in the filmed version of Stephen King novella, directed by prolific screenwriter David Koepp ('Panic Room' and many, many others).  The unexpected combination of them delivers to a certain degree -- like 3.5 points out of 5 -- but can never really deceive the eye of the viewers who have seen this type of thriller before.<br /><br />In fact, the greatest part of 'Secret Window' is Johnny Depp's skilled acting as popular writer named Rainey.  One day, while he is living in a remote woodland cabin, trying to write something, a spooky-looking guy with a heavy accent knocks the door, claiming 'You stole my story.'  When this guy, a Mr. Shooter, is played by excellent John Turturro, you know this guy can be very creepy.  And to us avid movie fans, his mannerism is very interesting to see.<br /><br />But things get worse when Rainey doesn't take him seriously, for apparently this creepy guy's intention seems more than you can take care of, acting like a stalker.  And Rainey has another thing to take care of, like the divorce with his  wife (Maria Bello), or still-ongoing enmity with her new boy-friend (Timothy Hutton).  And the private detective (Charles S. Dutton) is not helpful very much.<br /><br />The film tries to make the story more and more intense as it goes on, driving the character of Rainey into the metally confusing zone.  But what is most regrettable is, like I said before, everything looks utterly signposted for the viewers accustomed to this genre.  In the first place, the script lacks the central theme that should attract us -- if someone claims you stole a story, all you should do is easy: call your laywer, or disprove the claim by showing the proof, while Rainey is very, very slow to do this.  Moreover, the ending (which is not pleasant to see, I am afraid) wants to be a big surprise while WE KNOW there's gonna be a big surprise, which means, it is not.  In fact, the opening camera that quietly introduces us to the protagonist lying on the couch (and the camera moves into the reflection of the mirror, and stays in there) is more impressive than the flat ending itself.<br /><br />Still Johnny Depp is an actor not to be missed, and Turturro too, and Depp's quirky performance (with many detailed small actions) is very entertaining in its own way.  Though Philip Glass's name gives 'class' to this Stephen King film, it is Depp who virtually raised the production a few notches higher than other films based on King.<br /><br />Enjoy the film as it is; it's a so-so thriller and nothing but that.  But as to Depp's acting, it's another matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>This movie has one redeeming quality, well two. Depp ain't bad and the ground level premise of the two stories &quot;The Secret Window&quot; being similiar ain't bad either, but beyond that, what we have here is a monstrous mess. Whoever cast the role of the Mississippi 'guy', the townsfolk, the maid, the sheriff, etc., should now be unemployed. Awful acting, hammy, and anything else you can dream up that is b-a-d. Extras? When a movie is this poorly made, who cares. I found my local rental store has this movie miscategorized, it should be under comedy. If you are still looking for a 'new' suspense/horror movie on par with the Ring, keep looking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>I have come to rather enjoy Johnny Depp movies, for both their overall sense of weirdness, but also their originality. "Secret Window" is quite a good addition to Depp's range of films.<br /><br />As the blocked up writer, Mort Rainey, Depp portrays the semi-wasted, bad-hair-day, couch potato well. I would say that Depp has made an artform out of looking like the cat dragged him through the hedge backwards. His acting, in contrast, is very good, and he carries the intensity well.<br /><br />John Turturro, whom I always associated mostly with Adam Sandler comedies, comes across as a very freaky John Shooter, who accuses Rainey of stealing his story. Turturro really surprised me with the way that his posture, facial expressions and drawling accent carried a sense of forboding across. And that hat was just a nice touch.<br /><br />Without throwing in spoilers to the plot, I found this film to be excellent in most aspects. Some of the production was a little bit sloppy, (I noticed two mistakes in continuity, one which was with that hat that I loved so much). It did not detract from the movie that much, and the movie had a good level of nerves in it.<br /><br />After hearing some negative comments on it, I found "Secret Window" to be a great movie, with a good story. I enjoyed it....a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this movie before when it was called "The Shining."  I liked that one better.<br /><br />The paper-thin story is derivative at best.  One of the story elements that I particularly don't care for is the Omniscient, Omnipotent Villain (OOV).  And the OOV is definitely a main feature of this film.  The "twist" is not particularly surprising, although it does show a bit of directorial flair absent from the remainder of the movie.  Further, the pacing of this movie, which I'm sure was characterized by the studio as "deliberate," descends beyond that into "tedious."<br /><br />The performances can't be faulted; they are all very good.  In particular, Johnny Depp carries this entire film on his shoulders.  I suspect this would have been a one-star film with anyone but Depp in the lead role.  However, great performances alone can't carry the entire weight of a movie, and this one collapses on the shaky foundation of its script.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The Secret Window is a horror tale based on a Stephen King novel.  This is however, one of the better adaptations of a King novel.  Nonetheless, it is not unique in its presentation as it carries much similarity with films such as Brian de Palma's Raising Cain (1992) and the more recent Identity (2003).<br /><br />The second opening of the film has suggestive undercurrents to the theme of the film, as it cues the audience into the story.  The audience follows the camera lens in over a lake as it depicts a small rural house toward which the audience smoothly moves.  The audience moves in closer toward the house and in through a window as it finally faces a mirror through which the audience can see the main character sleeping on a coach.  The person sleeping is Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), a successful writer who has escaped his wife and divorce after having discovered her cheating on him six months ago in a local motel.<br /><br />When Mort wakes up from one of his afternoon naps a southern man by the name of John Shooter (John Turturro), demands justice as he insinuates that Mort has stolen his story.  Shooter gives Mort three days to rectify what he has done wrong, as he demands justice.  On the second day, Shooter kills Mort's dog.  Mort contacts the police, but the local police do not seem interested in his case, and in turn, he seeks help from a private agency that he has used in the past.  Nevertheless, the help Mort hired seems to be incapable to providing the help that he requested, as Shooter threatens him once more, this time inside his house, while the deadline draws nearer.<br /><br />David Koepp who wrote the screenplay for Spider-Man (2002) directs Secret Window, which brings a similar suspense that can be experienced in his other film Stir of Echoes (1999).  Johnny Depp as well as John Turturro enhance the cinematic experience through their great performances, as a well performing cast supports their parts.  As the end credit roll before the eyes of the audience they will have experienced a well-made film with the lesson of not trusting what one sees.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>I do like Johnny Depp and most of his films, unfortunately this is his worst effort to date (even his short part in the first 'Nightmare On Elm Street' film is better than this). The director was messy and in a hurry while making this film. Why do I think this? I'll tell you why. All throughout the film, you can see the camera lights reflected in Johnny's glasses. Look for the green box in his glasses. When I see this, I wonder how a director can be so clumsy, it is as if he doesn't care about his work. And it doesn't happen once, it happens through the entire film!!<br /><br />Now as for the acting. Johnny looks as if he decided to dress up as a writer for Halloween. It looks like a bad high school costume. He is suppose to be a writer and walks around with an Einstein hair-do and a beaten up bathrobe. His acting as a writer is even worse. He sits with his legs crossed while polishing his glasses and his head cocked. Give me a break!!<br /><br />This is suppose to be a thriller. But I had my hand over my mouth trying to stifle my laughter. This movie is hilarious. The scene where he confronts his stalker by the truck which contains his 2 dead friends is beyond ludicrous.<br /><br />The ending will have you rolling your eyes. As Johnny sits eating his corn on the cob, which is suppose to be a metaphor. I just cannot believe how bad this film is. Watch if you want to laugh...</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I saw this movie in theater and liked it a lot, so it's no surprise that I went out and bought it today. It may not say Special Edition on the cover, but this Dvd has as many extras as most Deluxe Edtions. The Featurettes are interesting and informative and run over an hour combined. My favorite being the Secrets Revealed segment that really helps put certain things in place and make sense after viewing the film for the first time. Now to Mr. Johnny Depp! Depp has been one of my favorite actors long before Jack Sparrow came out into public view, and the performance as Mort in this little film ranks #2 of all his roles in my opinion (Right behind &quot;Pirates of the Carribean&quot; of couse). The supporting cast, direction, and music are very strong as well. It's just nice to see a thriller that takes its time to build up to the twisted conclusion, without the mindless gore (which at times is good) and the paper thin characters. The casual and huge Johnny Depp fans who enjoy a good psychological thriller should buy this one, everyone else should at least rent it to see what an amazing actor they have been missing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>This was the first film that I had ever watched of Steven King, and was not quite prepared for the twisted macabre mind of his. Johnny Depp was really good as the demented writer who was still yearning over the loss of his wife, and reliazed to late that it was he in fact who was commiting the atrocious crimes to compensate for her leaving. This is a movie that makes you believe one thing, and then turns right around midstream and throws the right answer at you. Its gripping, frightful and full of insanity. The perfect movie for a dark and stormy night.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>This movie, based on a short (or, actually, a long) story by Stephen King, is about a divorced writer who is suddenly confronted in his Maine summer home by an intense man named John Shooter, who accuses him of having plagiarized a story called Secret Window, Secret Garden. Shooter quickly becomes violent and ominous, and Rainey (Depp) tries to obtain a copy of a magazine in which the story was originally published, which predates Shooter's story by two years. As he tries to get the magazine that will prove his case, his dog is stabbed, his home is burned down, and a private detective he hires is murdered.<br /><br />  The one substantive departure from the book involved the supposition that other people could see a ghostlike version of John Shooter, and I don't think the movie suffered for the omission. It must have seemed like an unnecessary extra, given the strong twin plot lines of ongoing divorce and crazed stalker. I liked the balance between the scary stuff and the sadness of the divorce, and there were several very effective scary scenes, in which an unseen killer seems to be lurking just outside the edge of the audience's field of vision. Depp does his usual good job, this time giving us a character who is alternately emotionless and emotional, who want more than anything to wallow in depression by sleeping on the couch. Conversely, I thought that John Turturro stunk it up as John Shooter, a fact partially due to some extremely clunky dialogue that lent artifice to the southern accent. Maria Bello continues to inspire mixed feelings in me; I liked her quite a bit in "The Cooler," but thought she was the weak link in Payback, one of my favorite all-time movies. I liked her in this, I think, and also liked Timothy Hutton as her new boyfriend.<br /><br />  I downgraded it a bit because of the dialogue, mostly, which intruded on many an otherwise fine scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>The main attribute of this film is the performance of Johnny Depp as the beleaguered writer.  He is recovering from a divorce (he found his wife in bed with another man) when John Shooter (John Turturro) shows up on his doorstep and accuses him of plagiarism.  Shooter turns out to be psychotic.  It should be easy enough to prove Shooter wrong, but he has a way of destroying everything - and everyone - that gets in his way.  Soon, it seems Shooter is too powerful to be a normal human being.<br /><br />I am familiar with the novella this is based on - it is one of Stephen King's more modest efforts.  The movie takes great liberties with the plot, so even if you are familiar with it, you will be surprised.  I have to say I prefer the ending of the movie to the ending of the book.  I was expecting a typical Hollywood ending, but the film turned it into something much different.  It is the Depp performance that makes everything work.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of writer/director David Koepp, but he does seem to have good taste in horror fiction (he also filmed Richard Matheson's Stir of Echoes).  Let's hope he continues the trend of making good horror movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Secret Window is classic Stephen King, not in the sense that it will ever be immortalized as a masterpiece of cinema or revered by movie fans for its pace and direction. No this movie (based on the King story) is classic in the sense that so many of the elements of this story have already appeared in other works from the horror maestro. Throughout the movie shades from both `The Shining' and `The Dark Half' abound and ultimately detract from the presentation with a distinct sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and `they did it better in...' pervading the movie.<br /><br />The story centers around a washed up writer Mort Rainey (played by Johnny Depp) consumed in alcohol and depression over a failed marriage and writers block who is shocked by the arrival of a stranger who accuses him of stealing his story (the `Secret Window' of the title). Things get worse for Mort as Shooter becomes increasingly violent and Rainey slips deeper into paranoia and insanity before a shocking climax. Depp does his best with the material he is given and this movie at times comes close to creating some real chilling scenes. John Turturro also turns in a memorable performance as John Shooter and Maria Bello elicits a great deal of sympathy as Morts (soon-to-be) ex-wife Amy, a character wracked with uncertainty about stepping out after the shelter of married life.<br /><br />Supporting performances by Timothy Hutton and Charles Dutton are both admirable, if both the characters they portray are slim on actual characterization and Len Cariou turns in a surprisingly good performance as Sheriff Newsome.<br /><br />Good for fans of the genre and people looking to be mildly entertained, just don't go in expecting to be particularly surprised by anything.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>That could be right, and this one certainly makes a tilt at proving it - for most viewers, the last twenty minutes of "Secret Window" may well undermine most of the pleasure of the previous seventy. The problem seems to be the source material: Stephen King's story is probably too slight to justify a feature, and the setup is so well crafted in the "intelligent thriller" mode that the climax, when it comes, feels far less clever than it ought to be. Still, it's not without its compensations. David Koepp continues to demonstrate that he can direct as well as write. He provides plenty of Hitchcockian moments of suspense, and the score by Philip Glass evokes precisely the kind of music Bernard Herrmann used to write. Johnny Depp is wonderful - as always - and here he again shows a real talent for comedy that has been under-utilized for much of his career. He cleverly and convincingly plays the eccentric writer, harried by an ongoing divorce and writer's block, who talks to himself and has an increasingly severe facial tic. His thoroughly entertaining performance adds enormously to the enjoyment of what is otherwise a rather light-weight affair.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>In any event, some serious glue sniffing definitely was comorbid with the making of this movie.  The flick is bad beyond belief.  For starters, there's the opening shot of Depp's shack, with the camera panning in over the water.  Now, hasn't this panning-in-over-the-water-in-double-mix-up-type-thrillers thing been a little run into the ground?  The secret ground?  I guess not, because here it is again, ladies and germs, right on the fuggin screen at a multiplex near you.  At least you wont be startled by the unfamiliar.  And we Hollywood types know how nervous you bourgeois filmgoers get when something original happen, kapeesh?  Not to worry, this one's gonna be as well-trammeled as your brain.  You know those characters you seen Johnny Depp portraying, like in films long ago?  Weeeeel, he's gonna be portraying them all over again in this "new" flick.  Yep, you'll thrill to seeing Raoul Duke reincarnated as some kind of degnerate writer who shacks up in a cabin with a cleaning lady he cannot stand to have around.  Why don't he just fire her?  Hey, listen honeybabe, then we wouldn't have a picture, now would we.  On the subject of Johhnny Deppp, the poor fellow should be sent to quirkaholics anonymous, he done should.  He oughta kinda git up thar an' say, like, "Mah nayme is Joannna Deeapp an' ahhhm a quirkaholic."  While he's saying this he can flex his mouth muscles like he's got TMJ, raise his eyebrows meaninglessly a few times, widen his eyes... you know, the whole bit!  lISTEN, dEPP  I'm on to you.  You know who I am and if you don't you can find out by doing a little detective work.  I demand you come down here and slap my face.  You know, you can knock on the door while I'm taking a cr*p or something, and when I go to the door while the dogs are barking and say, irritated as hell, "Yes, can I help you!?!?"  You can say, "Uhh, yeah, this is Johnny Depp," in a voice that sounds like your jaw's been wired shut.  Then I'll open the door and you can slap my face.<br />Now, to change gears a hair, on the subject of Koepp, my diagnosis is that he did up a few tubes of glue in the car on the way over to the scriptwriters' meeting, then - during the meeting - went inno the bathroom and got busy with some aerosol cans.  This is the only possible explanation for the lousiness of this script.  You know, he goes back to the meeting and the writers are tryina tell him the script is lousy but he's flying so high on Frazee paint fumes that he don't hear a thing.  Hey, listen, Koepp, I've been there, knowhamsayin?  But listen, honeybabe, put the paper bag down, and step away from it.  Which brings us to the subject of Stephen King.<br />All I can really find to say about King is that if I was his wife, I would be getting pretty frookin nervous by now.  First the Shining and now this?  Noooooo, heee doesn't wanna murder his wife, noooooooooooo.<br />And I'm out.<br />P.S. really Depp, I mean it.  get your *ss down here.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>I had high hopes for this movie. Then the words "Based on the Stephen King novel" came on during the opening credits and I knew I was in for something. Maybe other reviewers will have to forgive me, you see I've had bad experiences with "Storm of the Century," "The Langoliers," and the recent "Dreamcatcher," so maybe I'm being unfair...or maybe I just find myself let down by every single adaptation of a Stephen King novel I've ever seen.<br /><br />As usual, the characters like to take the hardest path out of a difficult situation. Johnny Depp is a writer who is out in the forest living in a cabin trying to come up with a new story when a Mississippi hick comes up and says, "You copied my story!" Eventually Depp points out that his version was published two years before the hicks, but the hick wants proof - which Depp can easily supply via the original copy of the magazine the story was published in. Of course, that would be TOO easy. Instead Depp decides to take a few naps and procrastinate. To get some action out of our hero, the hick kills his dog.<br /><br />Here is the only brief shining moment of intellegence in the movie: Depp is told by the hick not to tell the police...so he does! Yet there's a problem, (doh!) that being the local sheriff doesn't think a man going onto another man's property, grabbing his dog, and stabbing it to death with a screwdriver is a crime. And so for the rest of the movie its pretty much like "Storm of the Century" except "Give me what what I want and I'll go away" is replaced with "Show me the magazine!" This goes on and on...and instead of, you know, SHOWING him the freggin' magazine Johnny Depp just keeps digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble. Most of the time I'm left thinking, "What a MORON!"<br /><br />Of course, things clear up near the ending. But at an incredibly slow pace. Indeed, this had to be one of the longest, most drawn out conclusions ever. The fact that I saw it coming an hour into the movie didn't help either - you don't believe me? The exact same thing was done in "The Usual Suspects," "A Beautiful Mind," and "Fight Club," they just combined them all together. Sad thing is, those great plot twists combined don't work with this particular movie. I thought it was going to be a good ending - you know the kind Depp was striving for in the story - but it was just a typical suspense/psychological/killer ending. Maybe Depp's character should have written the script.<br /><br />Depp's acting in it really wasn't THAT great. He must have two expressions the whole time, and his voice is on constant stoner mode. Even when he impersonates the hick at the end he still sounds basically the same monotone voice, except with the southern accent. He was basically the same as I saw him in "The 9th Gate." Really, all in all this movie is a major letdown. If it received high critical acclaim, then its overrated, simple as that.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Stephen King story about a frustrated writer should tell you all you need to know about this dormant suspense thriller from the "Sixth Sense" school of logic. It plods along until it's not so surprising climax with little distinction between it and other similiar movies. Johnny Depp is cool, the film is not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Secret Window (David Koepp, 2004)<br /><br />What I still haven't figured out is how no one realized that "Secret Window, Secret Garden," the story upon which the film Secret Window is based, was nothing more than a rehash of Stephen King's novel The Dark Half from a slightly different perspective. Now, The Dark Half was taken on by a mighty, mighty director, George Romero, and it failed miserably. David Koepp is a good director (witness Stir of Echoes) and, when he wants to be, a fantastic writer (Bad Influence, the underrated TV series Hack), but let's face it, David Koepp is not on the level of George Romero. So why did anyone think this was going to work?<br /><br />Granted, they assembled one of the finest casts in recent history here-- Johnny Depp, Golden Globe winner and nominated for more Golden Globes, Oscars, and Oranges than you can shake a stick at; Golden Globe nominee and Cannes Best Actor winner John Turturro; Golden Globe nominee Maria Bello; Oscar and Golden Globe winner Timothy Hutton; Emmy winner and Golden Globe nominee Charles S. Dutton... I could keep going, but why? You've got a who's-who of underrated Hollywood already. And every one of them turns in a performance as wooden as the trees in Maine. Even Johnny Depp, who in a thirty-film career has never, even in his worst films, played a role that wasn't excellent, is off form here for the first (and perhaps only) time in his career. Depp, who has made a number of otherwise awful films worth watching, however marginally (Sleepy Hollow, The Astronaut's Wife, Don Juan DeMarco), can't save this turkey. The pacing is horrendous, and boredom will set in before ten minutes have passed. I will warn you, it gets no better. This is a thriller completely devoid of thrills, a mystery that's solvable long before the boneheads on the screen work it out. Normally, watching Johnny Depp act would be enough reason to rent this, but it doesn't cut the mustard this time. *</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>STORY: I'm starting to think that Stephen King's only motivation for writing now days is so he can cash in on the movie adaptions of his work. The past few movies based on his works have been duds, including this one. Honestly, the only good Stephen King movie was The Shining. In this movie Johnny Depp plays a writer who is having trouble starting his new work of fiction, and to add into the mix he is going through a divorce, which is only there in the plot so the ending can be what it is. One day a tall southern man dressed in black comes by and accuses Mort (Depp) for plagerizing a story of his. The man's name is John Shooter. As the story progresses things start to become more serious with Shooter, and basically that's it for the story until the mildly shocking end. I was mad when I saw the ending (people who know the plot of my script will know why), but don't get me wrong it's a good ending it's just that I thought of it first (Okay, fine, maybe King did publish it before I wrote it down last year). Anyway, the only problem with the ending is that the "idea" is good except the effect is a stinker. The audience will ask at the end of the movie "Okay, now what? Why did I sit through this entire thing?" There is no reason behind the motive, there is really no message to the movie, and usually psychological thrillers have those. This comes across as a thriller without a brain, no smarts included. The movie also contains no jump out of your seat moments, it does however have two or three scenes that will get the heart pumping a bit, but no jumps. Overall a bad movie with a good out of place ending that leaves the audience saying "So What?!"<p>ACTING: This is a one man show here. Like Colin Ferrel in Phone Booth. Without Johnny Depp this movie would be a crapstaviganza.  The only thing is that Depp's approach to the role gives some comedic moments to the film, and at some points that changes the tone of the movie, which in the end does not make the story run smoothly. I know why they did it though, because without Depp's comedic charisma this movie would be extremely borring, EXTREMELY!<p>BOTTOM LINE: The movie is a stinker, no doubt about it. The name Stephen King used to hold attention at the movies with such classics as The Shining and Pet Cemetery. Now we have Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital on TV and Secret Window in the movies. Icky Poo! The ending is good but can be seen a mile away and is very out of place in a movie like this, David Koepp who penned the screenplay did not do a very good job of building a "shocker". If you have a bunch of people in the audience saying "I knew it!", then that's a good sign that your movie failed to deliver.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is a good actor, but he doesn't "save" this movie, and frankly - in my opinion anyway - he did not deserve an Academy nomination for Pirates of the Carribian neither. He hasn't quite "convinsed" me yet, though I thought he was superb in Sleepy Hollow, he did a great job there.<br /><br />Well, Secret Window. This movie doesn't tempt me to open the Stephen King-book which it is based on. The story is so ungripping, and the end comes so sudden on you (in the movie anyway), and when I realized "the plot" the only thing I could say was : Is that all?<br /><br />A movie doesn't have to be perfect to be watchable, 3 stars means watchable and entertainig, but this movie really is a waste of time. Because of the ending of the movie I'm not sure if it deserves two stars even, but perhaps this is just my disappointment in the twelve dollars I just wasted on this sad attempt of a thriller.<br /><br />If you are a Johnny Depp-fan, you might enjoy it. Nothing's different about him here, he acts in the same old style - but unless you are a BIG fan, he probably isn't worth it in this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp stars as Mort Rainey, a writer who has had some success.  He is awakened by a man named John Shooter (John Turturro) who claims that Depp stole his story and published it.  Depp agrees to show Shooter proof that he did not steal the story, while Shooter makes it clear that he intends to make Mort's life tough until he obtains the proof.<p>This is just the beginning of the story, the window dressing.  What makes the film excellent is the acting.  Depp is wonderful again as a writer who is dealing with recent tragedy in his life.  Turturro is great as an almost over the top tough, Charles Dutton is a strong supporting friend/lawyer for Mort, and Timothy Hutton is menacing as the boyfriend of Mort's soon to be ex wife.<p>The plot is complex and twists often, but never out of control.  All the time, Depp is great and he really shows his range.  This character requires him to be in control of himself, but just barely.  There is an edge required here based on the situations the character goes through.  Depp pulls it off beautifully.  By the time the credits roll, you will be impressed.  The story makes sense, and the surprise ending is good (not great) but the strength of the acting makes this almost a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor.  Whether over-the-top funny in Pirates of the Caribbean and Ed Wood, or more understated like in this film or Edward Scissorhands, Depp adds a balanced believability to the characters he portrays that makes them leap from the screen in full 3-D.  The supporting cast is solid but unspectacular, so it is Depp who really shines here.<br /><br />The film stays very close to the short story in most respects.  After watching the film, I re-read the story (in Stephen King's Four Past Midnight collection) and found large sections of dialogue translated directly into the screenplay.  There are some subtle plot variances between the screenplay and the story, but the influence of King's storyline is very evident in the screenplay.  Ironically, the part that deviates the most from King's story is the ending--("I want you to fix the ending, Mr. Rainey.")  All things considered, however, this is a very faithful adaptation of a lesser known King work that does not lose the macabre devilishness of King's writing in translation to the screen.<br /><br />The only thing with which I found fault was the initial pacing of the film.  Part of the slow pace is intentional--setting up Mort's slothful state of existence is key to the story--but after 20 minutes or so, it begins to wear a bit thin and the viewer may wind up wondering whether this is really going to go anywhere.  It eventually does go somewhere, but it takes a bit of patience for the plot elements to gel and garner any serious viewer interest.  Stick around for the ride, however, and you'll be glad that you peered through this secret window and spied Depp's performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is a writer who's going through emotional crisis and is confronted by a stranger, who accuses him of stealing his story and demands him to change the ending. Some of the details of the plot are compromised for the sake of surprise and shock, but the outstanding performance of Depp makes up for any compromises. Watch this movie and try to overlook the simple suspense details and think of the more important questions: If you could go back in time, would you act differently? If you have the power, would you change the ending of certain stories in your life? How torturous is the relationship between you and your conscience, and after all, how outstanding is it to have a talk with your conscience every now and then?</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>If I hadn't seen that "Secret Window" was adapted from a Stephen King story I wouldn't have been surprised.  This flick just smacks of deja vu.  It's not bad King but it's not particularly great.  The blocked writer in a remote setting with murder and mayhem ensuing is just so familiar.  What elevates the film beyond the mundane are game performances by Johnny Depp as the harried writer and John Turturro delivering an inspired turn straight from "Night of the Hunter".  Maria Bello looks hot but essentially wasted.  Forgettable in the near extreme.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp, you just have to admire the guy.<br />He can turn any role into something brilliant.<br />He certainly did in this movie.<br />From start to finish, interesting, memorable, fun from start to finish.<br />The ending really didn't surprise me all that much.<br />I never read the story, but I've read so much of King's work, I knew what the ending would be halfway through the movie.<br />Still, it's a clever and twisty movie with the usual knockout performance from Depp.<br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp turns out a pretty good performance in this movie.

The movie for one is a really good movie with lots of twists, frights, and comic moments. The movie is about writer Mort Rainey, portrayed by Johnny Depp very well, who is living a calm life with his small dog on the outscurts of a small town. His ex wife lives in his real house in the city but they still haven't filed papers for the divorce. Mort is still haunted by peeping in on her and seeing her in bed with an other man. She claims she didn't cheat on him but he thinks otherwise.... Well anyway, everything's going fine for him until John Shooter comes to his house. This man's from Mississipi and is brilliantly portrayed by John Turturro. This small writer claims that Mort has stolen his story who denies it but when Shooter leaves a copy of his story, Mort realizes that they are identical. And then Shooter goes absolutely crazy and things start happening. Bad things. For one, don't get attached to the dog like I did. But, this horror movie with some very comic moments is one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years. Turturro's performance will always be remembered by me as one of the best EVER. You should see it just for that and for his awesome performance. His performance is even better than it was in the Birdcage, which was also great. Johnny Depp on top of it is wonderful as usual and adds a lot to it. This horror movie is surprisingly good and scary and I strongly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) a writer in a remote house in upstate New York, encounters an "apparent" fan, a character named Shooter (John Turturro).

It is at this point that we start questioning what is real and what is not.  As a matter of fact the movie may have been inspired by a recent Russell Crowe movie.<br /><br />The movie motors on to a climax that is different from the normal genre and that is why I rate it so high.

The casting is very good, and the story very well written.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it lacks that something to put it over the top.  After seeing The Others and The Sixth Sense, it becomes a bit predictable, though Stephen King has not lost his touch in providing an unexpected ending.<br /><br />In addition, there is a slight hint of Misery in the Secret Window, what with the writer/author in the middle of nowhere and all.<br /><br />Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, even though you might not want to go the extra mile and purchase it.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>Secret Window is a film based on a Stephen King Short Story Secret Window, Secret Garden.  Originally, I had read the short story several years ago and was apprehensive about seeing the film, because my memory of the short story was that the twist ending was somewhat difficult to comprehend.<br /><br />However, seeing this adaptation of it was a godsend in helping me appreciate a really good story.  Depp is perfectly cast as the Author who is being terrorized by a man known only as John Shooter, who accuses Depp of Plaigerizing.  Meanwhile, Rainey is dealing with his own demons as well as he works through a divorce he didn't want.  Depp proves he is one of our most prized acting resources as he tries to stay one step ahead of the madman.<br /><br />However, I would add that I found reading the short story with this book was a great help.  The film stayed true to the creepy ending, and actually helped clear some of my confusion regarding the original reading.  And the filmmakers wisely don't veer too far off course in translating this sad tale of lonliness to the screen.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy if you like thrillers, King, or Depp.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>This movie is so predicatable and gets boring after a while.

Of course Pirates of the Caribbean gave him ample stage room to run through his entire repertoire, so, by comparison, Secret Window comes up a bit short. They're entirely different genres, Pirates being high camp/adventure and Window being creepy horror, but still, there's room for comparison.<br />Depp, excellently cast against the equally well-cast John Turturro, plays a depressed, recently divorced writer who is surprised one day to be approached in his remote lakeside cabin by a distinctly threatening dude with a hillbilly accent and, tho you don't see it, it's clear the guy maybe used to be an axe murderer. He accuses Depp of plagiarism. As this all began with a Stephen King tale, you know where it's heading: into the realm of other-worldly horror stuff.<br />Not Depp's best work, although given what he had to work with, he does a helluva good job of it. And it's well worth watching if only to catch, as you sense he's going bonkers, his increasingly frequent tics that involve mouth and jaw stretching - and biting.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp's deft performance as a writer threatened by a &quot;fan&quot; for stealing his work makes &quot;Secret Window&quot; a worthwhile film to watch.  etween the exceptional support by the rest of the cast and the sharp direction by writer/director David Koepp, &quot;Secret Window&quot; manages to transcend the limitations of Stephen King's fine if predictable novella from &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;. In this case, style triumphs over substance as Koepp and his collaborators invest &quot;Secret Window&quot; with enough visual invention for three movies.<p>The film looks marvelous on DVD. The various featurettes about the making of the movie includes some of the previsualization footage allowing you to see how Koepp's carefully orchestrated direction adds to the tension of the film. We also get to see some of the footage that Depp shot with rehearsal footage, outtakes, and actual footage that was redubbed. Why is that important? Well Depp breaks into impersonation mode doing Brando, DeNiro and a whole host of other actors as he works his way through the character. The commentary track by Koepp is particularly revealing as he discusses why he chose not to go with the alternate ending (it's included as an extra) and some of the visualization choices he made as a director and writer.<p>While &quot;Secret Window&quot; comes across as a tad predictable, the exceptional performances from the entire cast and the directing choices Koepp makes certainly keeps this glimpse into someone else's secret window. With a high definition transfer and a nicely arranged 5.1 mix, &quot;Secret Window&quot; makes for an entertaining DVD.</p></br></body></html>

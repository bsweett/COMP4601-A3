Somehow this invisible enemy works out as his mirror distorted image.<br /><br />Sharp metaphor and interesting approach about the dark side of the moon in the human being. This cathartic experience will be unforgettable for him because never before this hell's journey will allow him to explore his real nature.<br /><br />That dark confession about his secret life backstage will be increasing. The dramatic construction is formidable. The different suspenseful vignettes are carefully filmed thanks a dazzling camera work , accenting the inner tension in our victim. He will have to face the sinister consequences of an out of control ethic, a real therapy session searching for his inner demons with New York city as landscape.<br /><br />Another additional evidence the film noir genre is still alive.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>This movie is quite short, even when compared to the latest Disney movies that are 90 or more minutes long. Phone Booth is a short and sweet 82 minutes long, but don't think that the length makes it a bad movie. It's not at all. It's short because it works. The movie's situation is something that could actually happen to some poor schmuck who can't leave a ringing phone unanswered. <p>The movie stars Colin Farrell as Stu, a hotshot publicist who walks around NYC in fancy designer suits toting his cell phone everywhere he goes. Everyday, he uses the same phone booth (so the call doesn't show up on his cell where his WIFE will see it) to call an actress (played by the sincere Katie Holmes) he's representing and also hoping to get into bed with. When he's finished talking to her, the phone rings, and not even thinking, he answers it. The voice on the other end tells him that if he hangs up, he'll shoot him.<p>One of the great things about this movie is that you will not know what to think of Stu. In the beginning, you'll find that you only see Stu as a huge materialisitc jerk. I was actually hoping that he would get shot. As the story progresses, your mind may change and it may not. I won't tell you how I felt about Stu at the end, that would ruin the fun.<p>Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this movie is how effective the voice on the other end of the phone is. The voice is Keifer Sutherland, sounding clear, but raspy and scary. And the motivation of this pyscho on the other end picking on poor Stu is excellent as well. Is he really a psycho afterall? Watch and judge for yourself.<p>Colin Farrell does a great job playing a guy who is forced into an array of emotions while on the phone. It may not be Oscar worthy, but it's worth the bucks to see. And of course Keifer Sutherland, the forboding voice, is highly effective-- definitely a noteable performance. <p>Good perfermances, interesting cinematography, and certainly a lead character that anyone can relate to at some point, this movie is most definitely worth seeing. With no frills or wasted minutes of exposition, it's quick, too the point, and just an all around awesome thrill ride. And hey, if you didn't like it, it was only 82 minutes of your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Phone Booth is projected with a real time sensation that offers thrills, and mind boggling situations and dialogues.  Stu (Colin Farrell) works in public relations and he is about to call his girlfriend through a pay phone.  On this occasion the pay phone rings and Stu answers.  There is a voice that says that he will be killed if he hangs up, which is proven through a small red laser pointer on his chest.  The caller is not ready to reveal why he called Stu, because the caller wants to play a little game before he tells Stu the truth.  The story is short, yet it is psychologically loaded with threats that keep the audience on the line ready for anything to happen.  Phone Booth offers a breathtaking cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>Not a bad move, not a great movie -- somewhere in the middle, perhaps a bit above the middle.  It stretches one's credulity to believe that the anonymous caller would go to such lengths to trap and humiliate a schlub like Stu.  Sure, he's sleazy, but no more so than 50,000 other people in Manhattan.  Worth watching once, but no more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>In Joel Schumacher's PHONE BOOTH (2002), unibrowed Colin Farrell makes a stink leading man. To be fair however, no matter which actor got trapped at that pay phone, this film about an unseen sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) obsessed with forcing liars and cheaters to publicly admit their venalities would be just as insipid.<br /><br />How stupid can the guy Farrell is playing be? There's probably a half dozen ways within the first five minutes for him to thwart the shooter by escaping, but this fool never tries anything crafty. Instead he hangs around long enough to be hemmed in by a wall of cops, frothing media types and assorted no-life Looky Lous. Clearly, as a publicity agent he's a slow-witted cipher so devoid of original thought it's little wonder that blatant canards and buckets of manure are his stock in trade.<br /><br />In hindsight, can you believe that not one, but TWO babes have the hots for this loser? I sure can't!<br /><br />Then we have the supporting cast. Hey, you want trashy? How about three skanky whoo-urs dropping the F bomb about 300 times in 15 minutes. Is torture your thing? Check out the flop sweat pouring off of Forest Whittaker's detective in charge. He looks almost embarrassed to be involved in this nonsense.<br /><br />Do us all a great favor, Kiefer: zero in on that guy holding the pay phone receiver and pull the darn trigger!</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>People walk in front of my house, talking talking on their cell phones. They talk loudly about personal things, like no one can hear. The mind boggles. Meanwhile, this film was made, as entertainment that suits the mood of phones and fixation. Great cast and crew capture NYC with a sharp action film focused on a Phone Booth; and It's fun, it's short and it's a red hot pistol.<br />Blu-ray looks good and sounds good; real good!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It has suspense, drama, a bit of dark humor, and some amazing cinematography. Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, and Kiefer Sutherland are amazing here, and the movie itself was a blast to watch. There were certain moments that needed some work (like the odd introduction to the movie), but other than that, it's still a very good thriller. I indeed had a fun time watching it.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>When this came out, it sounded silly. Kept putting it off until my movie queue dwindled. Gave it a second chance. Not bad. I couldn't quite give it four stars, but it was better than expected.<br /><br />In some ways, the acting was almost too realistic (which makes it more life-like but less likely to win awards). For that, I would give four stars.<br /><br />But, there is a lack of direction. Too many starts that are abruptly halted. On the flip side, it was pleasantly surprising that it ended when it did (i.e., short film) instead of dragging on and on like some competing films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>This film had a very unique plot that would either work well or not at all.

It plays like a vulgar movie length episode of the Twilight Zone.  Colin Farrell turns in the performance of his life as the sleazy PR guy.  On the other hand, Kiefer Sutherland fails to be a menacing enough phone caller and that dampens the fear factor in this flick.<br /><br />Given the profound lack of originality in Hollywood, any time a half way original movie such as Phone Booth comes our way, you simply have to at least consider giving it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film is a moderately entertaining thriller, at best, with moments of suspense that are few and far between. The plot, while promising, is too contrived and fails in its execution. It is saved from total failure only by the excellent performances given by Colin Ferrell and Kiefer Sutherland. Their performances, however, are not enough to make this film any more than a mediocre one.<br /><br />Colin Ferrell plays the role of Stu Shepard, a guy from the Bronx, who is a fast talking, self-important publicist for those celebrities who want to be more important than they are or deserve to be. His wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) is a beautiful young woman. Yet, she is not enough for the adrenaline charged Stu, who is lusting after another young woman, a beautiful and aspiring actress named Pamela (Katie Holmes), who has no idea Stu is married.<br /><br />When Stu enters a phone booth in midtown Manhattan one day to call Pamela, he answers the phone when it rings and gets a call that will change his life forever and bring about some self-realization. It seems that out mystery caller, played with effectively creepy resonance by Kiefer Sutherland, has had his sights on Stu for some time. Now, he has Stu right where he wants him, and Stu, for reasons the viewer will find out when watching the movie, has no choice but to play along and stay exactly where he is in this deadly game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />This film suffers from a leaden screenplay that brings the entire film to the level of a B movie that should have gone straight to video. In fact, do yourself a favor and avoid buying this film. Instead, settle for renting it, if you are a Colin Ferrell or Kiefer Sutherland fan. If you are not, deduct one star from my rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>At a mere eighty-one minutes run-time, Phone Booth seems more like a movie-of-the-week done for one of the testosterone-fueled cable networks than it does a theatrical release that stars several A-list performers. Colin Farrell (he sure does an American accent well, doesn't he?) stars here as a lying, using philanderer named Stuart, who is held hostage by an unseen sniper (voiced by Keifer Sutherland) in one of the final phone booths remaining in New York City. Forced by his sadistic captor to stay confined in the phone booth until he confesses his true nature and many falsehoods to those he has harmed, including an idealistic young woman played by Katie Homes, Stuart undergoes both a meltdown and a personal metamorphosis that transforms him even as it destroys the life he has created. Farrell, a sound actor despite his reputation as a fluffy playboy, delivers as a man confronted with both his impending demise and the flinty truth about who he has little by little become. Phone Booth is worth seeing if you're in the mood for a quick, fast movie, but it's not worth going to a lot of trouble to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I expected nothing out of this movie, and it turned out to not be to bad.  Collin Farrell is held hostage in a phone booth in manhattan until he makes amends for his dishonesty.  By who, well, I guess it is the world's best observer with lots of time on his hands (kiefer sutherland).  It was amazing how the movie did a good job at covering the bases to make it so this the main character couldn't leave the booth. Often times in badly written movies within a few minutes you figure out how they people are going to escape. You do here as well, realizing it will have to be the police that figure out what is going on, but it was interesting and at least entertaining how they got their.  Worth a rental, but not really a great thriller for the collection, at least in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>This is the kind of movie that is rare these days. It didn't cost an arm and a leg to make, it stars some good actors and the story line was plausible.<br /><br />I love the film phone booth. I think it is very clever that for an 80 minutes the film can hold one character in a phone booth and keep the story going without boring the viewers.  Colin Farrell is brilliant as an arrogant PR guy that goes through a range of emotions, and comes out the other side a better person, and with keifer Sutherland as the sniper that keeps him trapped there, that was excellent casting because he has such a chilling voice.<br /><br />It's hard to make a movie work when it takes place in a confined space with few characters, but when those movies succeed, it shows. And that's how it is with "Phone Booth."<br /><br />The cast and crew did a terrific job considering the film was shot over only 10 days. I would suggest to anyone that hasn't seen this film to do so, cause it not so far outside the possibility that it could happen to you. which makes it great.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>A fairly decent thriller. 3& 1/2 stars is closer to what I would  give this film. I liked the direction--and Forrest Whitaker was perfect in the role of a detective who does his best to diffuse a deadly situation. Keifer Sutherland, never a great screen presense in my opinion,  wears out his welcome early on, as the nutjob with his high-powered rifle trained on our man Farrell trapped in said phonebooth. The twist ending was not bad at all--although, somehow, the entire damn enterprise could have been a bit shorter.<br /><br />Hey, it's worth $7.50 --that's what I paid at Target for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie is original in the sense that it's made in ten days.  Looking at the commentary, it's obvious that movie-makers indulged themselves in this project is because they wanted to prove a point that it could be done.  That, they did with aid from enlisted seasoned actors such as Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, and Forest Whitaker.  The ending of "Phone Booth" was open-ended and this movie would mean different things to different audience.  Thus, its lukewarm reception by the mainstream captive audience.  Still, this movie is a tour-de-force in terms of capturing our attention for the duration of the movie as we were teased to wonder what would happen to Farrell's character next.  Whilst this project certainly raised some eyebrows, it did reinforce Colin Farrell's stand in movie-making industry for being an astounding actor for his versatility and his resolution.  To conclude, a movie that highlighted the main actor's brilliance but nothing else.  DVD's extra is thin by any standard.  Commendable watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>This man has been trap inside a phone booth for the longest cause a sniper treated to kill him. I all started when the person was talking to himon the phone these three hookers tried to get him off so bad then they sent their pimp to take care of the him then the sinper said I can take care of that man who is tring to get you out of that booth so he shot him now the whole world thinks the guy inside that phone booth killed him. This movie has the best drama and acting I've ever seen in a while on film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>This is one those films that really frustrates me.  It starts off with a pretty compelling idea that could have resulted in a extraordinarily tension-filled movie.  In fact there were points in the movie where the tension level is considerable, where everything clicked perfectly.  Unfortunately, there are ultimately more hits than misses when all is said & done --- one is left unsatisfied with a movie that simply didn't live up to its potential.<br /><br />Just what was it about killers such as the Beltway Sniper that left people feeling so unsettled?  Simply put, it was the shere randomness of the killings --- the fact that one moment you could be some anonymous schlub filling his tank at a gas station, and the next moment you could be a corpse with a bullet in his or her brain.  Is it plausible that nut job with a gun could pick you out at random while you were making a phone call from a phone booth?  You better believe it is.  Is it plausible that he knows somehow has the means to know your entire personal history & is producing a miniature morality play just to teach you a lesson?  Not exactly.  Once the deed loses its random nature, it becomes much less compelling & simply seems contrived.<br /><br />On the other hand, the movie is quite brief --- a full two hours of this would have had me turning off the TV from boredom.  Everyone involved in the production process is to be commended for understanding the dangers of dragging out a storyline to point where it cannot be sustained.<br /><br />When all is said & done, you could do much worse with your viewing choices, but just think about how truly thrilling this movie could have been if the right choices had been made with the storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Joel Shumacher/Colin Farrell, team of &quot;Tigerland&quot; comes back with totally different premise.  This time they are given a script from prolific (and perhaps underrated) B movie-king Larry Cohen.<p>Colin Farrell is Stu, New Work publicist who thinks the world goes around just for him.  Then he gets an anomymous call at a phone booth; now he gets it, and the guy on the other side of the phone says: &quot;If you hang up the phone, you are dead.&quot;  <p>And this strange guy with malicious voice really means it, pointing a rifle at Stu's head from somewhere in the high building in New York City (actually, the film was shot mostly in LA).  His wife and would-be mistress arrive at the scene, only to complicate the situation, but the criminal seems enjoying it, and continues to order Stu to do things he never dreamed of.<p>The film is short, which means a good thing.  You cannot keep on forever, holding the attention of the audience in this way, and in fact, the little moralistic conclusion is diappointment.  Thankfully, Colin Farrell (no matter what some people say) is a talented actor, and gives a credible performance as a guy trapped in this incredibly thankless situation.  <p>The supports are Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell (&quot;High Art&quot;&quot;Pitch Black&quot;) and Katie Holmes, but their roles are smaller ones compared to his.  Of more interest is the sniper's role, whose voice must have convincing sound.  &quot;24&quot;'s Kiefer Sutherland is cast in that part, and it works in a terrific way.  <p>Remember, &quot;Phone Booth&quot; is basically a B-movie.  That doesn't mean it is bad; it means, the film has a terrific idea at the core of it, but extends it beyond its limit.  At least, it is better than similar (and more complicated) &quot;Liberty Stands Still&quot; (featuring Wesley Snipes) as far as the tension goes.  You get intense acting from Colin Farrell, intense camerawork (Matthew Libatique, &quot;Pai&quot;) , and ... not so intense ending.  And there, at the end, you remember it's a B movie.<p>Because of several incidents (like the real-life sniper), the release of &quot;Phone Booth&quot; had been delayed in USA.  I don't know the film needed such treatment after all.  It is just an entertainment.  And a good one too.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>starts out as Farrell's strolling down the block talking on a cell phone, talking to his pal, then he goes to a phone booth and calls Katie Holmes, whos hes seeing on the side, then it becomes really good with Kiefer on the other line, tempting Farrell not to hang up or leave or he will be sniped down. Then there's these hookers and their pimp and the pimp gets shot and the police come and the cameras. Farrell's wife comes. (Radha Mitchell( Pitch Black and High Art).

Slip this 2002 film into your DVD player and you're in for a ride of a lifetime.  It kept me totally involved with my eyes glued to the screen for every one of its 88 minutes, which seemed to fly by in an instant.  Funny thing is that this is a simple film, with bascially only one scene and just a few excellent actors.  I loved it.<p>Colin Farrell is cast as a fast-talking publicist who we first meet on the streets of New York, doing elaborate deals and telling lies into his cell phone.  He's full of ego and thinks he's on top of the world.  However, every day at the same time, he stops into a phone booth to call a young actress who he is romancing.  She doesn't know he's married, and he doesn't tell her.  When he's ready to leave the booth, the phone rings.  He picks it up.  Big mistake.<p>Now we hear the voice of a sniper who's in one of the buildings near the booth.  He wants the publicist to confess his infidelities to his wife and girlfriend and threatens to kill him if he doesn't follow instructions.  What follows is an intense drama in which the tension never lets up.  The screenplay by Larry Cohen is tightly conceived and there isn't a wasted word or a superfluous character.  And Colin Farrell shines in his role, which has to be an actor's dream.<p>Kiefer Sutherland is cast as the caller and Forrest Whitiker as the cop who is in charge of the police action on the scene.  Radha Mitchell is cast as the wife, Katie Holmes is the girlfriend.  And one of the best scenes in the film is when a trio of hookers demand to use the phone booth.  All the acting is excellent.  And the New York City atmosphere is definitely authentic.<p>I can't say enough good things about this film.  It even has a moral to it.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Joel Schumacher proves once again with Phone Booth that he's much better at handling more serious movies. He did a good job with Tigarlands and A Time to Kill, Lost Boys and Flatliners weren't bad either. So the guy has talent, you just can't see that by watching Batman & Robin lol. <p>  Colin Farrell (DareDevil, Tigarlands) stars as Stu a jerk who plays people how he sees fit. He thinks he's better than other people and he gets knocked down a big notch. He uses a pay phone to call a potenial actress (Katie Holmes) who he's interested in sleeping with....when he's married. A mysterious and menacing man (Kiefer Sutherland) calls after his call with her from that pay phone telling him not to hang up or he'll kill him. The Sniper kills someone who was trying to get Stu to get off the phone and the cops come thinking Stu did it. Stu has to convince a cop (well played by Forest Whitiker) that he's not the shooter without actually saying he's not. He also of course has to find a way to get out of the phone booth alive. <p>  Phone Booth is an entertaining edge of your seat thriller even if it doesn't work entirely. For instance it's silly that it starts out with a Twilight Zone type narration introducing Stu. The film is  too short and we never learn much about the sniper. We don't learn why he finds the need to interfere in people's lives and try to play social worker....but with a sniper rifle. Kiefer Sutherland is great though even if it is just a voice over role. He's menacing and extremely scary, yet some how even amusing. Colin Farrell is very good as well in a role so many big stars such as Jim Carrey turned down. Farrel does so well making the role his that I couldn't have pictured anybody else in the role. Phone Booth is  short like I said but it does hold your attention the entire time and is still worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film is a moderately entertaining thriller, at best, with moments of suspense that are few and far between.

It suffers from too many lapses in logic; in fact, it is not at all plausible and depends primarily on style over substance. Still, it a fine piece of filmmaking that stands head and shoulders above recent high profile thrillers such as "Panic Room". Its best assets are a superlative performance by Colin Farrell, brilliant cinematography, and a fast pace that never once meanders into superfluous territory. <p>The story is simple: A sleazy publicist named Stu [Farrell] is walking with his assistant around midtown Manhattan one afternoon. Both are on cell phones wheeling and dealing. Dismissing his assistant, Stu makes his way to a phone booth, one of the few left in that part of New York. As usual, he is there to call the girl he wants to sleep with. By using a pay phone, he can avoid his wife's seeing the phone number when the cell phone bill arrives. After he hangs up, the pay phone rings. He answers, and a man's voice informs him that Stu better do everything the man tells him to do because the caller has a high powered rifle aimed at him. At first Stu thinks it's a bad joke. It isn't, and what follows is an intense and clever cat and mouse game. <p>Farrell is able to give the unsavory main character enough humanity to make us care about what happens to him. Kiefer Sutherland does well in an interesting role. Playing the Caller, he is not seen until the end of the movie, and then only for a few seconds. <p>Those who expect a thriller worthy of Hitchcock will be disappointed. Those expecting a merely entertaining thriller will be pleased.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This movie is like Speed in the phone booth. Colin Farrell is one of my favorite actors. The whole movie takes place in one location and he kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Jim Carrey would have been terrible in this role. He over acts too much. Colin is one of the best actors in Hollywood at the moment.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>PHONE BOOTH is the second pairing of director Joel Schumacher and star Collin Farrell; unfortunately it is a disappointment compared to their first collaboration, &quot;Tigerland.&quot;  Farrell playes a sleazy, small-time New York press agent.  He lies to his clients, the press, and anyone else he can use.  This situation comes to a head when he is pinned down in a phone booth by a sniper.  <p>Schmuacher can be a good action director, so I was expecting much more from this movie.  Even though the movie is short (my DVD counter said 89 minutes), it really drags at times.  Farrell is pretty good, but we don't get to know much about his character before the sniper incident, so I really didn't care much about what happened to him.  The characters also tend to be a bit over-the-top, expecially the three prostitutes, who add some unintentional (?) humor.  Also, PHONE BOOTH is ultimately too preachy and moralistic for it's own good; it's simply too shallow of a movie to pull it off well. <p>Perhaps the best part is Schumacher's director's commentary; Schumacher is a solid director and he knows the kind of information that will be of interest to the audience.  Too bad he didn't have as much sense when he was making the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In &quot;Phone Booth&quot; a fast-talking, two-timing Broadway press agent named Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) stops at his regular phone booth to call the young wannabee actress he wants to be his mistress (Katie Holmes) so that it does not show up on his cell phone bill where his wife can see the number.  But as soon as he hangs up--and refuses delivery of a pizza--there is a second phone call and a voice telling him what to do and what to say or else he is going to be shot.  Everyone should know the situation from the trailers and recognizes the voice on the other end of the phone as belonging to Keifer Sutherland, which is enough to take the situation very seriously.  Stu takes a bit longer to be persuaded and by then he is into this situation so deep that there looks like there is no hope of ever getting out of it. <p>&quot;Phone Booth&quot; is only 81 minutes long, which makes sense since Stu gets himself into this situation pretty quickly and since the intensity is on high for almost the entire film.  This is not a film where you try to figure out what is really going on and why the voice on the other end of the phone is playing out this twisted little game with Stu.  After all, can you really believe anything said by somebody who is holding a gun on you?  What the voice wants does not matter.  The question is how many people are going to be dead when this one is over.  The motivation is secondary in a thriller such as this one.  <p>At first I thought that Sutherland's voice work is too good, because director Joel Schumacher does not filter the voice through a phone so that we hear it the way Stu would.  Instead we hear Sutherland's voice clearer than we hear Farrell's.  But then it dawned on me that doing this was to help force the viewer more into the perspective of a voyeur.  After all, since we do not know where the sniper is which means that any and all camera shots could be his perspective.  <p>In the final analysis, what makes this film work for me is the character of Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker), the cop who shows up to take charge of the situation and tries to find out what is going on instead of jumping to conclusions.  As was the case in &quot;Panic Room,&quot; I very much appreciated the idea that there are smart cops out there who do their jobs the way they should be done.  What really saves &quot;Phone Booth&quot; from being a two-dimensional film is when Ramey turns the dyad into a triad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Clocking in at only 80 minutes, "Phone Booth" resembles an unusually bloody, foul-mouthed episode of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." Colin Farrell gives a masterful performance as a cocky, two-timing New York publicist who is gradually turned into a quivering, remorseful mass of jelly by a psychopathic sniper on the other end of the line at a Manhattan phone booth. Put the receiver down, and I will kill you, the sniper tells him, taking out a guy or two on the street to prove his point (and making it look like Farrell did it in the bargain). Director Joel Schumacher keeps the tension at a high level throughout the movie, and he manages to keep in check his usual penchant for grandiose cinematic flourishes (except for extraneous outer-space shots at the beginning and end). Besides Farrell's excellent performance, the movie is helped greatly by Forest Whitaker as a courageous police negotiator and by the superbly menacing, burnt-umber voice of Kiefer Sutherland, serving as the voice of the sniper.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Phone Booth is a real nailbiter. An genuine edge-of-the-seat roller coaster ride brimming with non-stop suspence.<p>It certainly isn't the deepest of thrillers, and it has flaws in logic and presentation, but the idea behind it is a tension grabber: A man answers a phone in a phone booth only to be told that if he hangs up, he'll be shot by a gunman lurking in a nearby window. The man is Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), an obnoxious New York press agent. Stu, who is married, regularly uses this same phone booth to call a young client and would-be girlfriend (Katie Holmes, who isn't given much to do) because he doesn't want the number to show up on his cell-phone bill. But the calls - and lives - of those who use the phone booth somehow are being monitored by a man with a vengeance (Kiefer Sutherland). <p>Screenwriter Larry Cohen (It's Alive) has created a situation that so tense, you can overlook the thematic overreaching. Stu is forced into one double bind after another, with the Caller forcing him to make comments to his wife (Radha Mitchell) on the phone and to neighborhood strippers and cops on the street that only bolster the perception that Stu may be a gun-wielding menace. Director Joel Schumacher and Cohen keep the action taut and believable within its own self-contained world. Although the phone booth may confine Stu in uncomfortable ways, it has a liberating effect on Schumacher, who infuses his filmmaking with a no-nonsense energy to keep the story moving.<p>The movie definitely works, holding you to that screen like poor Stu is held in that booth. At 81 minutes, "Phone Booth" is a lean, mean tension machine, setting up its premise, executing it with smarts, throwing in enough twists to keep things interesting, and wrapping it up before anyone can get fatigued or reflective. It's a smart, edgy thriller that kept this viewer glued to his seat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Phone Booth (Joel Schumacher, 2003)<p>I got suckered again. I admit it. I watched yet another recent Joel Schumacher film. This time, I figured, Schumacher has himself a fantastic cast, it can't be any worse than Liberty Stands Still, and, really, it's less than eighty minutes long. How bad can it be?<p>To answer that question, I will say that my first comment after the movie was over was "the best thing about it was that it was less than eighty minutes long."<p>Colin Farrell (who is finally breaking out of the "I'm a soldier" stereotype) stars as Stu, a very not-nice guy who lies for a living. (He's a media publicist.) Stu makes a phone call from the same phone booth in New York City every day. On the last day before Verizon (nice product placement, there) is set to tear down the phone booth, while Stu is making his daily call, a guy tries to deliver him a pizza in the phone booth. Stu gets rid of the guy, then the phone starts to ring. He answers it and finds himself in conversation with another very not-nice guy (Kiefer Sutherland), who just happens to have a sniper rifle, and it's trained on the phone booth. If Stu hangs up, he dies. The sniper spends the rest of the film doing various things to put Stu into uncomfortable situations.<p>Sound like the kind of thing a mean, well-armed teenager would do? Well, yeah. Wesley Snipes, in Liberty Stands Still, at least had himself a cause (even if it was a misguided one). This guy is just there for the fun of it, really, unless you believe his story about wanting to make Stu a better person by making him confess his sins in public. There's not really enough here to make it buyable. The sniper comes off like a sadistic juvenile. Stu comes off like someone who's perfectly content to be emotionally manipulated, and his gradual transformation into said Better Person is completely unbelievable. (This is not to take away from Farrell's acting job, which on its own might have pulled this off, had he not been handed such an awful script.)<p>Schumacher, who decides about halfway through that you can't turn My Dinner with Andre into a suspense film, brings in the big guns. The police arrive on the scene, captained by Forest Whitaker, a man who needs no introduction, but has suddenly found himself in a number of roles that do no justice at all to his magnificent talent. Ghost Dog, phone home, we miss you. Stu's wife and would-be girlfriend are played by the wonderful Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, High Art) and the decent Katie Holmes (Go, The Gift) respectively, and their parts are painful to watch. Mitchell, one of the great underrated actresses of our time, is given sharkbait to work with, and to her credit treats the material with the respect it deserves, zilch. Holmes' part actually has some potential, early on. (Of course, his conversation with Holmes' character in the first few minutes is long enough to have some meat to it, whereas his conversation with Mitchell is obviously of the "we need to introduce this character, how will we do it?" variety.) Unfortunately, when Holmes turns up again halfway through the movie, her entire part consists of standing in a crowd with a pained look on her face.<p>Given a cast like this, a proven situation, and even the barest competency in scriptwriting, camerawork, and direction, you've got a surefire winner. But the script was written by the inconsistent Larry Cohen, who turns out the odd script that fires (Best Seller, The Stuff) now and again, and the rest of the time turns out, well, the Maniac Cop movies and the third It's Alive movie, Island of the Alive. (If you haven't seen it, you've spared yourself a good deal of trauma.) Cinematographer Matthew Libatique provides hard evidence that good cinematography doesn't always outperform bad direction; the man who single-handedly made Tigerland barely watchable falters here with almost every step, which is extremely out of character (he's also Darren Aronofsky's preferred cinematographer. Nuff said.)  And then there is Joel Schumacher, who has completely forgotten how to make a good film since 1990. The guy who made Flatliners could have pulled this off without a second thought. But Joel Schumacher is no longer the guy who made Flatliners. He's the guy who made the last two Batman flops. * ?</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>I waited a while to see this film.  It didn't seem like it would be worth watching.  So I asked several people who said it was okay.  Others said it was good.  I should have considered the source.<p>This movie is just plain boring.  I read another review that said it should have been a straight to video release.  I couldn't agree more.<p>The only reason this film made it to the theaters is that Colin Farrell is seeing an upward spike in his popularity. (I doubt it will last.  I like him well enough, but the press on his personal life is far more interesting than his acting ability).<p>A guy is stuck in a phone booth, because someone on the other end of the phone is going to kill him or someone else - that's the premise of the movie.  It doesn't deviate from that - not once.  I knew what was coming from a mile away.  I knew what was going to happen at the end and I knew who would be blamed with everything.<p>There's just not much to this film.  It's threadbare in its plot.  You don't really care about the lead (Farrell), nor do you give a flip about anyone else.  There's no reason to.  The screenwriters nor the director bother giving us enough information to feel any identification with any of the characters.<p>Phone Booth garnered hype only because at the time of its initial release, a sniper started shooting up D.C. in reality.  Since the premise of this film is a sniper, it gave this weak film millions of dollars of worth of free publicity.<p>Don't bother!  Really!</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>'Phone Booth' was one of those movies where I found myself both very interested but still skeptical: It had a very intriguing concept, but could it fly as a feature length film? The answer is yes, though Schumacher and Cohen knew to play it safe and bring this one in as quickly as possible, as it clocks in at a mere 75 minutes, not including the credits.  I generally like films that are long and slow and layered, but it's also great to see a film where the makers can see the limits within the setup and only take it just as far as it'll go. What can I say, it's just a very entertaining, relatively intelligent thriller with lotsa great dialogue, solid performances and an energetic visual style.  Good stuff.<br /><br />It's seems unlikely that anyone won't know it already, but I'll provide a brief plot synopsis: Colin Farrell plays a slimy, lying PR man who at the films open goes out to a phone booth to make a call to his potential mistress. Shortly after he finishes talking to her the phone begins to ring, and he picks it up to find a murderous madman, voiced beautifully by Kiefer Sutherland, on the line. It seems that the caller isn't terribly pleased with Farrell's lifestyle and wants to teach him a lesson via his sniper rifle. He's not just going to kill him, however; he's got bigger things planned. I certainly could go on, and lotsa stuff was revealed in the trailer, but now that it's been a couple of years since this came out people might not remember, and I don't wanna give anything away unnecessarily. Suffice to say that Cohen and Schumacher find a way to wring a lot more out of the situation than you'd probably anticipate, and there are a couple of really very surprising developments.<br /><br />Stylistically, 'Phone Booth' is a very modern, rather derivative film, coming across as a combination of David Fincher and '24'. Schumacher's use of the split screen stuff occasionally comes across as unnecessary and overdone, but it all works well as a whole, allowing the movie to maintain interest, visually despite the fact that it's mostly just a buncha people standing around.<br /><br />The performances are solid and professional. Some have complained about Farrell's accent, and I'll admit that I didn't find it totally convincing, but I stopped noticing it after a while. (Plus, all the New York accents I ever hear come from TV and Movies, so I guess I don't really even know how accurate it is.) More significantly, Farrell just finds the right balance in the role, showing Stu to be quite a scuzzbag, but still kinda likable anyway. Sutherland is great as the Caller, and I suspect that how much you like this movie will be predicated on how much you enjoy his character. I found him enormously entertaining, very funny and with a lotta classic lines. (The best one: Towards the beginning Stu says he doesn't believe the Caller and threatens to hang up the phone, so the Caller cocks his rifle. He says: 'Now doesn't that just torque your jaws? I love that. You know like in the movies just as the good guy is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun. Now why didn't he have it cocked? Because that sound is scary.') Nobody else has too big of a role. Forest Whitaker plays the captain whose trying to figure out just what the hell is going on here, and he acquits himself nicely, edging along the cop-character cliches while not actually falling prey to them. Unfortunately, the film feature the lightweight non-actress Katie Holmes, but as fate would have it she's playing a lightweight, naive wannabe actress, so she works out alright.<br /><br />The film gets a little speech-heavy and preachy at the end, but what can I say, I thought it worked. The speeches were well written enough, and delivered under relatively plausible circumstances. I've heard the film called a morality play, and I think that describes it pretty well, but it never forgets that the first goal of any film should be to entertain. It also ended more effectively than I'd anticipated. I didn't think they'd be able to wrap it up very well, but they found a way.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done. Definitely one of the best thrillers in recent memory.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>In 2002, Joel Schumacher, director of THE LOST BOYS and FLATLINERS, brought us a whole new reign of terror and suspense with his 2002 flick, PHONE BOOTH.<br /><br />  STU SHEPARD (played by Colin Farrell) is a philandering celebrity publicist, who holds nothing but lies and deception. At a nearby phone booth in Manhattan, Stu gets a call from an unknown and unseen sniper (played by Kiefer Sutherland), who plans to murder Stu if he does not tell his lies to the whole world. But that's not all. Stu is married to the beautiful KELLY SHEPARD (played by Radha Mitchell), but is having an affair with Pamela (played by Katie Holmes). The sniper wants Stu to reveal "everything"; his lies in his publishings and his lies to his wife, Kelly. Is it possible that Stu will come forth with his lies, or is it possible that he will be so eagerly stubborn to the point of being murdered? The only way to find out is to watch this suspensful thriller.<br /><br />  I was really amazed by this movie, although, it really does not deserve five stars, but four. Kiefer Sutherland is the only actor, who was able to fit the role of the unknown sniper. His voice was so scary and so evil that no other actor in Hollywood was able to fit it. That is because Kiefer Sutherland, whether playing a good character or an evil character, is the best frigging actor on God's green earth. No argument. No disagreement. I state a true fact about Kiefer Sutherland. He made this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>In what seems like the most unlikely premise of all, we are treated to one of the most suspenseful movies so far this year. Not many people could take a film that has 90% of it taking place in a phone booth and still make it good, but Schumaker pulls it off here. Colin Farrell really shines in this movie, and as the suspense mounts toward the film's resolution, you really feel sorry for him. The sense of hopelessness he's feeling becomes your own as you realize there's no easy way out of the situation. The only thing I have against this film is that it could have easily been made into a PG-13 film for a wider audience range with just the loss of profanity. The violence is not as full as Lord of the Rings, but every third word is profanity and that's what earned it the R rating. I understand that you're trying to show Farrell's character's mounting desperation, but it could have been toned down a bit. Still, Keifer Sutherland's calm and even-tempered tone of voice is just psychotic enough to make you cringe when your own phone rings. He's definitely on a roll with his series "24" and now this great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>this movie is so deep it's not even funny<br /><br />it goes to show you what happens to a smart ass client that thinks he can talk sh** about people and get away with it<br /><br />still the sniper guy is more crazy albeit<br /><br />but the ending is great<br /><br />the movie keeps you in suspense<br /><br />I was so scared for the guy<br /><br />I mean the minute he leaves the booth he gets shot<br /><br />so here he is<br /><br />he can't call the cops<br /><br />he can't leave the booth<br /><br />he has people pissed at him and some scared for him around him and he can't even leave<br /><br />that is a truly terrifying situation<br /><br />and on top of that<br /><br />I really thought the guy that said "you'll regret that" at the beginning was the killer. but I was wrong. a shocking movie that sends shivers down your spine. that's what I felt. and that's what I'll feel every time I watch this in my dvd player. a timeless shocker movie that goes to show you that you can't always get away with what you do without punishment. glad I have this on dvd. you should give it a try</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>I first heard of Phone Booth a year or two ago when Jim Carrey had dropped out of the project.  I loved the premise: a man answers a ringing phone and steps inside the phone booth.  He is told by the man on the phone that he is in the sights of a high powered rifle.  The movie will be an hour and a half and will take place almost exclusively in the phone booth.  It sounds very experimental and could be a horrible failure or be very interesting.  The movie was delayed for a reason I don't remember, and then it was delayed this past fall because of the sniper attacks in Washington D.C.  Finally, the movie gets released this April and I finally get a chance to see this movie that I've been hearing about for a long time now.  <p>I've already mentioned the basic plot of the movie, so I'll go into a little bit more detail on the story.  Colin Farrell plays a slick publicist who calls his girlfriend (but takes off his wedding ring while making the call) from a phone booth so that his wife does not find out about it.  When he finishes with the call, the phone rings.  He answers it and now finds himself in a situation where if he leaves the booth, a sniper threatens to kill him.  The voice of the sniper is played by Keifer Sutherland, and this casting is perfect.  I cannot imagine anyone bringing more menace to a phone conversation than Sutherland.  While Farrell does a very good job in his role, it is Sutherland that makes the movie.  Unfortunately, it is Sutherland's character that is without strong motivation.  We must accept that he is a nut, because his reasoning is not very credible (maybe that is the point, but even so).  Despite this flaw, I absolutely loved the movie.  <p>There was quite a bit of tension and suspense all the way through the film, with enough brief scenes of humor (sometimes the humor came from the tension) to not make it unbearable.  Simply put, this was a well played, well acted, and well made film.  Not perfect, but it is a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Every once in awhile I see a movie about some particular horrible circumstance and wonder...if I had actually experienced what happened on screen, would I enjoy the film? Do war movies seem as thrilling if you've been in a war?  Are movies about terrorism or a hostage crisis as entertaining if you've actually been a victim? Does a movie about a phone booth in New York City seem as authentic if you're familiar with New York City?<br /><br />Phone Booth has one hook - the phone booth.  It's a one-act play with a camera singularly focused on its star.  If fifty percent of the film is the location, the other fifty percent is that actor.  Phone Booth manages to mess these both up in astounding ways.<br /><br />The first problem is that Phone Booth takes place in New York City but wasn't filmed in New York City. This is immediately obvious to anyone familiar with New York City. It's not New York City - it doesn't feel like it New York City, it doesn't look like New York City, and there's a big honking LA bus in the background at one point.  We're supposed to focus on the fact that the phone booth is the remnant of a bygone era, about to disappear forever because it is too slow, too old, too calcified with the advent of mobile phones. Instead, all I could focus on was how this was so not New York City.<br /><br />It's what people who don't live anywhere NYC think of it though, complete with hookers screaming at people. And that's who the movie is for - folks who don't actually live in the city.  It's also very much a pre-9/11 film.  For anyone who lives in NYC, the police response in Phone Booth is an insult to the officers who protect the city every day.<br /><br />If Phone Booth fails on a purely geographic level, the rest of the film's burden is squarely on the shoulders of the lead.  It would make a lot of sense for that lead to be a New Yorker, but it's understandable that the director might cast a wider net.  You'd think though, that he'd at least try for an actor who is a U.S. citizen.<br /><br />But no, we get Colin Farrell as Stu Shepard.  Farrell can't fake a New York accent to save his one-dimensional character's life. Worse, Shepard is a stereotype - he's what people think publicists are like.  So Shepard's a bed-hopping, money-grubbing, smooth-talking "operator" who makes connections, breaks hearts, and gets it done, baby.  He is a walking, talking archetype in a cardboard city backdrop.<br /><br />That leaves our villain, the silky voice on the phone.  Kiefer Sutherland's purr is perfect for this part, although he seems a little too fond of cocking his rifle without ever un-cocking it. That's not enough to save the preposterous plot, which is a deconstruction of a slimy human being with the ever-present threat of violence. Sutherland's character creates a moral quandary by forcing Stu to choose between his mistress (blank cipher Katie Holmes) and his long-suffering wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell).<br /><br />The only other relief comes in Forest Whitaker as Captain Ed Ramey, who shows some modicum of introspection and character development. Ramey stands head-and-shoulders above all the other characters because they're all so unlikable. The sniper doesn't even seem to have a motive - he's more the righteous voice of the audience's moral rage against "city people."  We're meant to sympathize with him as he strikes down pimps and publicists, but really this is about making the audience feel better about not living in a big city.<br /><br />And that's who this movie is aimed at.  If you think that New York City is filled with pimps, prostitutes, and publicists, that snipers are lurking from every window, and that New York's Finest are incompetent boobs, this movie is a passable thriller.  For the rest of us?  It's a pale imitation of the real thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I give this movie five stars because Colin Farrell's performance is dynamite.  Even though only 80 minutes long, Farrell was on screen almost the whole time, and the range of emotions displayed is awesome.  There's an Oscar waiting for him in the near future.  Kiefer Sutherland as the voice/sniper was also great, malignant in his self righteous judging of other people.  Joel Schumacher's direction was excellent; with such a stagnant setting such as the phone booth, he manages to keep us riveted to our seats, wondering when the next shot will come.  Other than Forest Whitaker as the chief of police in a fine solid performance, the rest of the cast is basically supportive.  Radha Mitchell is good as Kelly, Farrell's wife; John Enos III as the pimp Leon is pretty decent; and Katie Holmes is always pretty to look at, though she doesn't have that much to do.<br />This is one of those movies that got battered for whatever reason; I think it's a top notch thriller.

He stops at that phone booth at the same time every day to call a young client with whom he likes to flirt. One day, as he is finishing up his calls, someone calls him. The phone in the booth rings. Stu answers. The caller doesn't identify himself, but asks that Stu listen while the caller telephones Stu's young client and reveals that Stu is married. The caller also insists that Stu telephone his wife, Kelly (Radha Mitchell), and confess his emotional infidelity to her. When Stu refuses, the caller demonstrates his power by shooting a toy that is on the ground next to the phone booth with a high powered rifle. And the game is on. The caller says that Stu is being punished for lying to his clients, colleagues and his wife. If Stu does not confess his sins and do exactly as the caller says, the caller will kill either Stu or a bystander. When the caller kills a man who is trying to pull Stu from the phone booth, it attracts the attention of the police, who blame Stu for the shooting. Police Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) is the senior officer on the scene, and he would like very much to avoid shooting Stu, who refuses to leave the phone booth. Stu must try to communicate to the police that there is a sniper holding him hostage while doing everything he can to prevent the sniper from claiming more victims.<br /><br />"Phone Booth" has an interesting premise. And Colin Farrell does a good job of conveying the extraordinary stress that Stu in under as he must negotiate for the lives of the bystanders while his own life is constantly threatened by both the sniper and the police. Farrell's performance is the stand-out element of this film., and I recommend "Phone Booth" to Colin Farrell fans for this reason. The ability of the caller to pull off such an elaborate game of extortion is a less credible. But what I really don't like about "Phone Booth" is its production. Director Joel Schumacher's tastes seem to have shifted from the height of overproduced extravagance in 1997's "Batman and Robin" to bargain basement production values in "Phone Booth". This movie just shouts "cheap". And since the production is so self-consciously chintzy, Schumacher thinks he can pass that off as style. Being able to make a good film on a small budget is great. Making a mediocre film that looks like it was made on a shoestring isn't. And what's with those blue filters? This film is blue. Ever since those bluish automobile advertisements became popular a few years ago, Hollywood has embraced the cyan cast far too widely. Even the grungiest neighborhoods in New York don't sport odd color casts, and who would want them to?</p></br><a href="../users/A4CHIXX0HOB3G.html">A4CHIXX0HOB3G</a><br/><p>Stu Shephard was an awesome chsracter for Colin Farrel to play.

Unfortunately, Family Plot became Hitch's last film and shortly there after Hitch died. While it is pleasant and diverting, there's no telling what Hitch might have come up with as he worked with Cohen on this thriller. COuld it have been another North by Northwest or another Rope? It's difficult to say. Sadly, we'll never know what potential Hitch could have found in this script. <p>The premise is promising; Colin Farrell plays an oily PR man who uses his cellphone as his weapon. He thrusts and parries as if it is a sword picking on a wide variety of both suspecting and unsuspecting villans. The predator is preying on creatures of a like mind. <p>The one person he doesn't use his cellphone to call is the young actress he is trying to seduce. He's been using the same payphone everyday to speak to his potential conquest so his wife won't spot the unfamilar calls on his bill. An unseen sniper played to perfection by Keifer Sutherland has been following Farrell's character. On a day he knows Farrell will use the phonebooth, he stakes it out with a high powered rifle. He's become judge and jury for a man he finds morally wanting. His threat is simple; Farrell has to confess to his wife that he has been planning to cheat on her and the sniper will let him go. Farrell can't do it. Instead, he harrassed by hookers who use the phone regular; mistaken as a murderer by the police when someone is killed by the sniper and trapped in the phonebooth. If he tries to leave without completing what's been asked of him, the sniper will kill him. <p>Director Joel Schumaker (Batman Forever, Tigerland, A Time to Kill)creates a suspenseful thriller using what is, essentially, a rewrite of Cohen's own God Told Me To. His use of split screen is similar to Brian DePalma's best work (particularly the underrated Blow Out and Carrie). This technique isn't particularly new revolutionary. I see someone has made reference to the television series 24 and its use of this technique. It's an approach that hasn't been used much in film over the last decade and the adoption of it for television gave an edgy quality to 24. It also works in Phonebooth as well. Schmaker keeps it interesting by giving multiple angles of the same event, breaking up the splitscreen almost as if it was a picture-in-picture mode on a television. It generates suspense even in the less credible scenes of the film.<p>While Cohen's script is a tad bit predictable (particular as it winds down to its conclusion), the first 40 minutes are fresh and vibrant. Partially that's due to the director and the script but a lot of that energy is injected into the thriller by Farrell's corrosive PR guy. He inhabits the character brilliantly (I had to chuckle during the scene where he gives the police officer tickets to see Britney Spears and tells the officer to &quot;give her my love&quot; art imitating life or vice verse?).<p>The performances by most of the male characters are very good to outstanding. Katie Holmes plays the potential love interest for Farrell and her role is a thankless one. She doesn't have all that much to do during the first half of the film than talk back to the villan on the phone. <p>Screenwriter Richard Walter once told me that there's nothing more boring than a scene with a character on a telephone. To give Cohen, Schumaker and Farrell credit they almost get away with using this one-trick poney to create a credible suspense film. While Schumaker's a talented director, he's no Hitchcock or Spielberg. Hitchcock would have found something to make the story more interesting and come up with a character that we actually care for that we don't totally respect. Still, I have to give Schumaker high marks for tackling such a limited movie; the restrictions placed on him during much of the movie are somewhat similar to those that Hitch placed on himself with Rope (although to be fair, much of what we see in Phonebooth takes place away from Farrell's character. We're able to &quot;see&quot; this because the characters are speaking to other characters on the phone).<p>Phonebooth would have made an interesting and very good B movie. It's a bit underwhelming as an A movie. The extra money spent on projects like this can actually work against the project. <p>The transfer to DVD is very good. The sound is outstanding. The extras are a bit on the slim side given all the extra room on this disc but quite interesting. Farrell's performance and Schumaker's direction make this a much more interesting project than it might have been in lesser hands. While the concept is stretched out too long and hasn't dated all that well (how likely is it that his wife would find single out the phone number of the girl Farrell's trying to seduce given all the people he calls multiple times during the day?), Cohen and Schumaker make a game attempt to update it. There was a comment in somebody else's review about how this would have made an interesting Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode. That's slighting the effort that went into this project. In the right hands and in another era, Phonebooth would have worked very well as a feature film. It's the wrong movie for the wrong era.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>Colin Farrell stars in this thriller.  His character, a selfish work-aholic, answers a pay phone.  The caller threatens his life if he doesn't start donating his time to his loves ones.  The thrills begin the moment the phone rings.  Every scene after that makes "Phone Booth" worth watching at least once.  The intensity keeps the audience asking themselves what will happen next.  Forrest Wittacker and Katie Holmes give wonderful performances as a cop and Farrell's concerned and second girlfriend.  One will not be disappointed after watching this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Released by 20th Century Fox and presented by Fox 2000 Pictures, &quot;Phone Booth&quot;.  Colin Farrell stars as a man in New York City on 53rd Street.  He uses this payphone booth everyday to call his girlfriend.  This phone booth is the last glass-enclosed with a door (like the one's used in the 1970's) that exists and the only one working in the area.  So Colin uses the phone booth to place a call like he always does.  Then the phone rings for him.  It is a sniper.  If he leaves the booth he would be killed.  The sniper (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) can even make a three-way call and try to destroy the relationship Colin has with his girlfriend.  The laser-rifle is pointed at Colin.  One wrong move, one wrong phone call.../ Yet another film that is off-tint.  I dislike this color process of film where the color is altered.  Color-bleaching, I dislike this too.  The outside scenes with Colin are all off-tint or color faded.  When he makes a phone call, we see a little &quot;window&quot; of who he is talking to in full color.  Plays better on television.  Actually mostly filmed on 5th Street in Los Angeles.  Filmed in 10 days.  DVD offer audio commentary by Joel Schumacher.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>PHONE BOOTH is essentially an 80-minute one-man show by Colin Farrell, and he pulls it off flawlessly.<p>Farrell is Stu Shephard, a glib New York press agent who'll concoct any story and utter any lie to further his own agenda. And he's also hoping to cheat on his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) with Pamela (Katie Holmes). In the pantheon of the world's villains, Stu is relatively minor. But not to The Sniper.<p>All of PHONE BOOTH was filmed on a single set, depicted as the site of the last enclosed phone booth in Manhattan, at 53rd and 8th. Hearing the booth's phone ring, Shephard picks it up. The audience hears (as a voiceover) the disembodied words of The Sniper. Apparently peering from an overlook above the street, the caller threatens Stu with death if he hangs up and leaves. An appropriate demonstration of his shooting capability is provided, which anchors Stu in the booth.<p>The Sniper has recently executed two of society's sleazebags, one a pornographer. Now it's Shepahard's turn, unless he repents publicly for his many sins, all knowledgeably listed by his tormentor. And to whom is Stu to make this confession? Well, to the hordes of police now surrounding the booth, who think the body in the street is Stu's doing. To the on-site police commander, Capt. Ramey (Forest Whitaker), who has to sort out the mess while wondering why Shephard is glued to the phone. To the broadcast media descending with soundtrucks and cameras. And to Kelly and Pamela, both drawn to the scene by the live TV coverage.<p>Farrell is the unquestioned star of this nail-biter, but it wouldn't work without The Sniper's mesmerizing voice (provided by Kiefer Sutherland). It could be the voice of Satan himself welcoming Stu to Hell, and Farrell's bravura performance leaves the audience with no doubt that he's burning in his own personal napalm of self-judgement, humiliation, and terror.<p>Once one accepts the plot's premise, there's no fault to be found with this film. As an entertainment vehicle, it delivers edge-of-the-seat tension, a moral message, and a satisfying twist of an ending. And even a bit of humor, as when three local working girls berate the beleaguered Shephard for monopolizing the means of secure contact with their Johns.<p>PHONE BOOTH is a jewel of escapism.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>&quot;Phone Booth&quot; is a brief, entertaining and brisk film. I can believe that it was directed by the same director of the pathetic movies &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman & Robin&quot;, this time Joel Schumacher did the things right.<br /><br /> Colin Farrell stars in "Phone Booth", he plays an egocentric, self-centered, manipulative guy, and Farrell really gets the job done, he dominates the role because not only he plays in a very convincing way the character, but as the movie moves forward Stu changes and Farrell displays a good range of emotions.<br /><br /> Kiefer Sutherland plays the psycho that harasses Stu, most of the movie Sutherland only uses his voice, and that's enough because the audience really is convinced by his performance. The beautiful Katie Holmes plays Pamela, she is Stu's "girlfriend", and even though Katie appears briefly in "Phone Booth", she is more than welcome.<br /><br /> The movie's pace is very fast and the editing is very cool, like in the TV action series &quot;24&quot;. Farrell is good as Stu, but Kiefer Sutherland steals the show, he is a great villain in this movie with his creepy voice. &quot;Phone Booth&quot; should entertain most of the people.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>You're walking down a busy street. You pass a phone booth. The phone starts to ring. Do you pick it up? It must be part of the human psyche, but it seems that there is just something that makes us want to pick up that phone. We do.<p>The same thing happens to New York City publicist Stuart Shephard, when he thinks nothing of picking up a phone on a Downtown street. On the other end is an unnerving voice that tells Stu not to hang up the phone. Stu soon realizes that the man--whoever he is and wherever he is--has a rifle. A sniper rifle.<p>The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) tells Stu that his lack of honesty and inhumanity has made him the target for this extortionist plot. If Stu hangs up the phone, he is dead. If Stu tells anyone who is on the other end of the phone, he is dead. The Caller wants Stu to confess his sins, which includes telling his wife why he uses a payphone every day instead of his cell phone.<p>The reason is because Stu has been having a fling with a wannabe actress. The actress has no idea Stu's married. But when the Caller forces Stu to tell his wife the truth on television, everyone knows. But the Caller still won't let Stu go. He's never going to. Stu will be killed before the day is over.<p>If the cops surrounding the place don't do something about it very soon.<p>"Phone Booth" is brought to us by Joel Schumacher, a man many hate yet many adore. He is the man responsible for the previous two "Batman" installments. Many claim him of ruining a series, when, in fact, the series was ruined by the first sequel. Joel Schumacher is too heavy on the darks in his "Batman" films, and his directorial efforts can be very bad. But he also brought us the wonderful character breakdown story "Falling Down," a film I have been quoted as saying is one of the best films of 1993. He also brought us the Brat Pack film "St. Elmo's Fire," the other Kiefer Sutherland film "The Lost Boys," and, among others, the tragic "Bad Company" and "8MM." But "Phone Booth" has some of the attributes of all those films. It has some "Falling Down" in it, some "Bad Company" in it (shudder), some "Lost Boys" in it, and yes, even some "Batman & Robin" in it. But it's on the same level as "Falling Down," i.e. it's a very watchable, if somewhat repetitive thriller. <p>My first impression upon seeing previews for "Phone Booth" was that I thought it had some real potential. Given the right dialogue and director, a boring situation can be turned into an intense one. Take, for instance, the scene where Stu is being commanded by the Caller to take a hidden handgun from the phone booth and wave it at the cops. We don't know how he's going to get out of it. But then when he does, we think to ourselves, "Why didn't I think of that?" I like thrillers that make a situation seem inevitible, then suddenly solve the problem. <p>Colin Farrell sports a good New York City accent, and Kiefer Sutherland sports a good Willem Dafoe voice. He's creepy, strange, and thanks to the film's technique of Hitchcockian suspense, we don't see him. At least for most of the film.<p>...<p>And next time you walk down a street, think twice before picking up that ringing phone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>Colin Farrel portrays a smaller-then-he-thinks publicist in this 80 minute 'thriller'. Although I have given this film 2 stars, I will say that the first 40 minutes of Phone Booth were actually quite gripping up until even Kiefer Sutherland's voice acting started to annoy me. And what made the film even more of a time waster was its rather stupid ending, making the whole film pointless as it really is a poor excuse threatening to kill a guy to, in effect, 'teach him a lesson'. <p>Not that the acting was bad or charatcers annoying, its the screenplay that was poorly written, especially for Kiefer Sutherland. Attempting to make him out to be this psychopath, towards the end, you actually think it is in fact a comedian (a bad one at that) whose aquired a rifle and is having fun toying with this guy in a phone box.<p>For Colin Farrel fans, you may as well see this, but for those who hate anti-climax's, don't bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>There's about 15 minutes worth of script here. At best this film could have been stretched into a taught half-hour TV show in the hands of a director like Alfred Hitchcock. However, those days are long gone. This is another example of a potentially good story premise poorly executed. The trailer says it all. Did I mention that Colin Farrell is thoroughly obnoxious and downright nauseating? Only Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland keep this from being a one star zero.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film is a moderately entertaining thriller, at best, with moments of suspense that are few and far between. The plot, while promising, is too contrived and fails in its execution. It is saved from total failure only by the excellent performances given by Colin Ferrell and Kiefer Sutherland. Their performances, however, are not enough to make this film any more than a mediocre one.<br /><br />Colin Ferrell plays the role of Stu Shepard, a guy from the Bronx, who is a fast talking, self-important publicist for those celebrities who want to be more important than they are or deserve to be. His wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) is a beautiful young woman. Yet, she is not enough for the adrenaline charged Stu, who is lusting after another young woman, a beautiful and aspiring actress named Pamela (Katie Holmes), who has no idea Stu is married.<br /><br />When Stu enters a phone booth in midtown Manhattan one day to call Pamela, he answers the phone when it rings and gets a call that will change his life forever and bring about some self-realization. It seems that out mystery caller, played with effectively creepy resonance by Kiefer Sutherland, has had his sights on Stu for some time. Now, he has Stu right where he wants him, and Stu, for reasons the viewer will find out when watching the movie, has no choice but to play along and stay exactly where he is in this deadly game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />This film suffers from a leaden screenplay that brings the entire film to the level of a B movie that should have gone straight to video. In fact, do yourself a favor and avoid buying this film. Instead, settle for renting it, if you are a Colin Ferrell or Kiefer Sutherland fan. If you are not, deduct one star from my rating.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>This film starring Colin Farrell is interesting at best but doesn't quite fill the bill.<p>Farrell does a great job running through every emotion possible while being stuck in a NY city phone booth at the mercy of a creepy voiced sniper (played by Keifer Sutherland). But the film stays incomplete because nothing is ever explained. Why did the sniper pick him? What is the sniper's motivation? Had the motives been explained it may have been a hit.<p>Don't waste a dime on this DVD, wait until you can catch it on TV unless you are a true Colin Farrell fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Stu Shepard lives an extremely complex life while pretending to be somebody important. Feigning interest in people while attempting to use them, juggling a wife and a girlfriend while hoping to taste the best of both worlds, and portraying himself as something better than a publicist takes a lot of time and finagling. But stepping into that phone booth he's used time and again and answering an incoming call makes his situation all the more difficult to adjust to - and live through.  <p>While watching Phone Booth, I - like the man in the booth - went through mood swings of my own. First I thought it was going to be a nice ride, liking the introduction of Stu and the things added to him that seemed to scream "sniper bait." The ego, the flash, and all the pretty words seem to state that someone might want to take revenge on our main character. Colin Ferrel actually seemed to fit the role, too, delivering a nice punch as a jerk, and I kept thinking that he would make a nice "victim" in a game that was certainly going to try to turn the tables on him. Then came the phone booth and the call, leading into the little games and all the hoops he was told to jump through, and I found myself going from a mindset of "that's not a good situaiton to be in" to wondering where this was going. Granted, the torment was fun at first and the research the shooter did was commendable. Still, the conversation and the deconstruction seemed almost pointless as everything moved forward. There was a lot of shouting, some "do what I say or else" comments spoken, but the progression didn't seem to have any really meaning attached. And next came the torment that just kept going on and on and on, and I kept wondering when it would finally end and let me out of the booth as well. Some situations that should have been tense showcased themselves more than once as they hoped for dramatic build and I found myself fighting the urge to fast forward some of those supposed tense scenarios. And when it ended I thought that the reasoning behind it was cold-blooded and made up for the stringing along effect I sat through, but the movie itself went on a tad too long and was hard to forgive. <p>This isn't to say that I found the movie without any substance and vacant, because there were some decent portions playing within the whole. The message within the bottle was a disturbing, sure, and the Sutherland as the bad guy gave him a bit of appeal. When it came down to presentation, however, the movie was nothing more than views from a scope, a phone booth, and some snapshots of a police roadblock. Development of the "why" involved wasn't really there, nor was the movie ever really focused on anyone save for the man in the booth. We only heard Sutherland's voice until the very end and didn't see anything to say who he was or why he did things, and Forest Whitaker served only as a way to try and bring conclusion and to play a clich&eacute; police role. So, would that mean I'm calling this a waste of time? No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd simply advise against seeing it unless you need something to watch, boredom and a lack of better movies to watch playing a key role therein, and can't keep your curiosity at bay.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ.html">A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ</a><br/><p>Phone Booth is easily one of the most intense 80 minutes in film history.  Word to the wise, never pick up a ringing public telephone.<p>THE STORY:<p>Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell) is a Manhattan publicist guilty of a few things:  being a somewhat dishonest businessman and lustfully fawning after a young actress, Pamela (Katie Holmes) despite being married.  Little does he know that someone's been watching him lust after Pam.  When Stu enters his Manhattan phone booth to talk to Pam (as has been his ritual) he's taken hostage by a psychotic sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) who's determined to make "bad men" repent for their unrighteous actions.  Things go from bad to worse for Stu when he's accused of shooting a street pimp from the booth and the swat team arrives to take him into custody.  Unfortunately for him, the sniper won't let him leave the booth till he confesses his sins.<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>It amazes me that the entire movie takes place on a street corner in a phone booth - all 80 minutes of this movie.  It amazes me further that the movie manages to remain engaging and enthralling.  The suspense maintained by the movie is very reminiscent of Sutherland's other current big profile work, namely 24.<p>The sniper character voiced by Sutherland is easily the highlight of the movie.  The sniper is obviously a psychotic stalker and killer.  However, he is also at the same time an avenging angel with an odd sense of justice.<p>BEST SCENES:<p>Well, quite honestly, the whole movie is basically one big scene at the phone booth.  At a brisk 80 minutes the movie moves along at a brisk pace and is quite honestly one big thrill ride.<p>THE DVD FEATURES:<p>Not much to write home about here.  For the DVD you get the now standard director's commentary (great listen) plus the theatrical trailer for the movie.<p>THE VERDICT:<p>At a short 80 minutes "Phone Booth" is perfect viewing - a quick but intense thrill ride.  Think of it like a quick high, it doesn't last very long but is worth every minute.<p>Highly Recommended</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I found this film strangely compelling.  A simple concept and a limited set were still able to deliver a fine result.<br /><br />In essence, Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a regular user of the same phone booth and his calls and routine have been watched by a compulsive stalker (Keifer Sutherland) whom we never see until the film's end.  His voice alone, however, is menacing.  The stalker has a gun pointed at Shepard from a nearby window and prevents him form hanging up for fear of being shot.  The plot and the very life of Shepard blacken with time until a gripping denouement is reached.  The stalker is there but cannot be seen.  His influence is powerful.<br /><br />There are many, myself included, who would doubt that a film based largely in a phone booth could ever work.  To my surprise, it did.  The clever use of split screens and the lurking presence of the sniper ensure that one is kept on the edge of one's seat.  Hats off to both Farrell and Sutherland for making the concept work.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Oh, yeah.  It's been awhile since I've watched a white-knuckle thriller--a seat-squirming, heartburning, hit-the-pause-button-while-you-run-to-the-john pumper thumper.  PHONE BOOTH takes a simple--almost ridiculous--premise and turns it into an 80-minute rollercoaster ride.  Director Joel Schumacher should have included the instructions, &quot;Hold onto your seat&quot; on the DVD cover.<p>Okay, so the film has a few problems, beginning with the sleaziness of the protagonist, Stu Shepard (played wonderfully by Colin Farrell).  Stu is not exactly the kind of guy one would like to have as a business partner--or, as it turns out, as a faithful spouse--yet over the course of the movie Farrell effectively brings humility and humanity to the character.  In addition, the sniper's control of the entire story requires a major suspension of disbelief, and the inability of police on the scene to quickly determine the person Stu is talking to on the phone as the &quot;bad guy&quot; is mind-boggling. <p>But who cares?  PHONE BOOTH still delivers a spine-tingling thriller, centered around a terrified man unable to leave a phone booth lest the sniper (the magnificently evil voice of Kiefer Sutherland) would cut him down.  Forest Whitaker is also solid, albeit dense, as the police officer in charge of negotiating Stu out of the phone booth.  The ending is predictable, yet still wickedly done.  Put some handrails on your recliner and enjoy.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>I have never been a big Colin Farrell fan. You know with the dating the slut thing. This movie looked good so I picked it up. I was very surprised by the films intense look. It is very heart pumping. You wont expect what happens next. Colin Farrell's perfomance though kind of killed it for me. Because he gets shot in the ear and he just goes you shot me. Then through out the rest of the movie they totally forget about it. That is why I only gave this film 3 stars. Also becuase theres no special features But this is still a great film, which needs good acting. Johny Depp or Mel Gibson either would have been better. This is a great film but only watch it for the pshycology.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>PHONE BOOTH Blu-ray is packed the way HD movies should come.  It's loaded with MPEG2@26MBPS video, which means that everything on the screen looks simply incredible.  The colors are vibrant and the images are sharp and clear.  At this point in time, picture quality really doesn't get any better.<br /><br />The audio portion of the disc was treated in the same fashion.  The soundtrack as well as the special effects noises were crystal clear and come through a surround sound system gloriously.<br /><br />Unfortunately, high-tech doesn't improve the movie.  It's still a good watch with plenty of tension, but not enough of the story is given.  Colin Farrell and Forest Whitaker are the only two given the chance to really act.  An argument can be made for Kiefer Sutherland's voice-over work, but he was missing in action when it came to being on-stage.  Also, other than the commentary, there were no extras or behind-the-scenes pieces.<br /><br />But it's top of the line for people looking for the true experience of an HD disc for their home entertainment systems.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Colin gives one of the most powerful performances of the year with his turn as Stu, one of those fake superfitial New York big business men whose too big for his own good.  He's also the type of guy who dreams about cheating on his wife, and even make plans to do so, lying to a young aspiring actress (played by the ever wonderful Katie Holmes) just to get in her pants...but at least he has the decentsy to remove his wedding ring (even when calling her from a pay-phone) and that pay-phone is where our movie begins, and ends, never leaving the booth for the entire run (close to an hour and a half)...but that in itself does no harm to the intensity of the film, it actually adds to it because we never leave the forefront of the action, never leave the midst of the drama.  This is Colin's best performance to date, and Keifer is equaly creepy...he just has the perfect voice for somthing like this, it makes the hair on your neck stand tall.  Great movie, solid performance and a grave overlooking at oscar time for Colin (he deserved at least the nod) leave me wanting to watch it again and again...</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I've always wanted to pick up a ringing pay phone just to see what would happen if I did.  In PHONE BOOTH, Stu Shepard does and it changes his life forever. Stu is a semi-successful publicist who has been playing games with people his whole life.  Everyday he goes to the exact same phone booth to make a telephone call to his girlfriend so that his wife won't find out. He's not having an affair, just contemplaing having one.  One day the phone in the booth and there's nobody around to answer it.  Curiousity killed the cat. Stu's no cat, but he is awfully curious and picks it up.  On the other line is killer who has been sniping off lowlifes and scums from the face of the New York City. The sniper tells Stu that he'll shoot him if he doesn't do exactly what he tells him to do and thus begins a game of cat and mouse via the public telephone lines in the phone booth.<br /><br />PHONE BOOTH was a fairly entertaing thriller that's great to eat while eating some popcorn.  Colin Farrell is over-rated as an actor, but PHONE BOOTH is one of the few movies where he's been cast right. Kiefer Sutherland's vocal performance is quite remarkable and sets the tone for the entire movie. Forest Whitaker has a nice supporting role as the police captain in charge of bringing the "dangerous criminal" Stu in alive and without getting anyone else injured or killed. None of the other performances stand out, largely because the characters aren't given much screen time.<br /><br />The plot in PHONE BOOTH is full of holes and inconsistencies, yet it is somehow able to keep one's attention.  The biggest flaw that I found with the film is that the ending was much too tight and overly convenient.  With a run time of less than 85 minutes the filmmakers could have added a little something to fill in some empty spots and make a more satisfying ending. So sit back and relax and if the phone rings, don't pick it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Sunday, August 01, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Nifty little thriller.<br /><br />Taut, quickly paced and right to the point, this nifty little thriller has Colin Farrell being held `hostage' in a New York city phone booth by Kiefer Sutherland, who has his rifle sights trained on him from above.  Urged by Kiefer, slick publicist Farrell must obey and confess his sins or see those innocents around him shot.  Police are dispatched and the interplay between sniper, hostage, and police make for a decent thriller.  It doesn't try to be more than it is, and it's over as quickly as it starts but for that hour-15 or so it's pretty effective albeit somewhat preposterous.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>&quot;Phone Booth&quot; throws you as the viewer into a terrifying yet realistic situation, scares the life out of you, and then leaves you just as quickly to recover.  It is smart, entertaining, even funny at times, but not dull at all.  It features only three real performances, one of which has only about two minutes of screen time.<p>Colin Farrell plays a publicity agent who is all lies and double talk.  He spends the first few minutes wheeling and dealing on his cell phone trying to line up appointments for his clients, all of whom believe he is the real deal.  He has certainly presented himself that way.  He then goes into a phone booth to call his &quot;mistress&quot; (he hopes).  He uses the booth so the call can't be traced on the cell phone and his wife won't see it.<p>After the call, the phone rings and he answers it, beginning one of the most frightening experiences you will witness.  He is basically held hostage by the caller on the phone, who has done his homework and knows what a liar Ferrell is.  The caller (Kiefer Sutherland) intends to get a confession out of him and teach him a lesson.  Eventually the cops show up to straighten things out and the main officer (Forest Whitaker) starts to see that Ferrell is not totally in control.<p>By the end, I was exhausted by the ride.  The ending is not a happy one, but it makes sense and goes along with the story as told.  All in all, this is one powerful 80 minute film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>.<br />Phone Booth has gotten mixed reviews, including being slammed by Amazon's reviewers themselves, but damn, I really liked it. Yeah, it could have been cut, with perhaps the saved time being used to develop further the relationship with the mistress wannabe and with the wife. But still. I was on the edge of my seat each time that creepy voice on the other end of the line chuckled and commanded the poor guy to reach for the gun overhead. Although the tension was high, the end was predictable - but if for nothing else, the movie is worth watching just for the scenes with the hookers who want that guy OUT of the phone booth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Well, it's one of those rare times where I'm finding myself siding against the naysayers, who in my opinion failed to not only get the point but to also enjoy this great film.<p>I'll start with the objections this film stimulated and i'll take it on from there.<br />  A lot of reviewers are asking why the sniper in the film is doing what he does to the man in the phone booth. But, that's a moot question folks, and it only proves that you're conditioned to believe that everything has a "logical" reason behind it. Newsflash: it doesnt. Remember the recent sniper incidents in Washington? What was the "logical" reason behind them? Or, what was the "logical" motive of those killers? Why do you accept irrationality in real life but yet you look for "reason" when this "irrationality" is shown to you in a film? You see the contradiction here?<p>  "Phone booth" is about a sniper who's picked out his next victim (he's already killed 2) after he's found out a few things about his life (mainly that he's a professional liar -media publicist - and that he's cheating on his wife). With this "ace" up his sleeve the sniper traps his victim in a phone booth by demonstrating to him that he, the sniper, is an expert shooter, and that he's enough over the edge to make due on his threats if the victim doesnt comply with the sniper's demands. Also, if not more importantly, the sniper threatens to reveal all the ill-doings of the victim to those that have been enduring his lies. With the threat of his marriage falling apart and with his whole career also threatened with destruction the victim is forced to play along in a game of life and death but cat and mouse as well..<p>  All this is layed-out in very convincing fashion by the scriptwriter and the director and it puzzles me that a few reviewers talk about plot-holes. Plot-holes? If someone can demonstrate to you that he's psychotic enough to gun you down for his own (whatever they might be) reasons and that he's good enough a shooter to manage it you would take your chances? You wouldnt be looking for such plotholes in real life, would you? Didnt think so.<br /><br />  This film is brillant on many plateaus if i may say so..First of all, the risky business of having the entire movie filmed from the perspective of a phone booth could've been a disaster in other hands but the whole film-team has done a great job preventing that from being the case.<p>  The plot moves quickly with constantly reinventing itself, as the threats take new twists and as the sniper keeps using his intimate knowledge of the secrets of his victim to corner him even more. The arrival of the police at the scene after the sniper kills someone who attempts to "boothjack" the phone booth adds a new dimension to the victim's helplessness as they think that he is the killer, and thus, the victim realises that he's now got 2 fronts to deal with.<p>  No need to go into the plot deeper. It will keep you watching unless you refuse (this time for YOUR own bizzare reasons to see that you'd be reacting in a very similar way in the victim's shoes in the film).<br />  What's actually even more effective about the film is the cast. That, in its turn, is surprising as Farrel (the trapped booth guy) pulls out a great performance in portraying the scummy type who earns a living by daily spreading lies and financing his superficial but expensive lifestyle from them.<br /><br />  But the show is actually stolen by the "voice" (Kiefer Sutherland). The voice has a tone that sounds, at the very least, super convincing about the threat it delivers. Firm, dark, sarcastic when needed and constantly ominous with a confidence that..kills, Kiefer is perfect being on the other end of the line. The "voice" is best when it talks about what drives it: and what drives it remains obscure till the end which i thought was the right way to go. At times the voice becomes the moral angel of death but before you can believe that it turns again into being a chaotic force that does what it does, well, because it..can! <p>  At a short, but steady and fast paced 80 minutes the "Phone booth" is actually amongst the top 3 thrillers of last year and one of the most intelligent recent films alltogether. Every element in it works and if there's one thing that seems to be taking the easy way out is the ending which i wont reveal here for obvious reasons. But even that is nothing that can subdue the power this film has.<br />  Great, great stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>Bravo ! Filmed in only 10 days, it's for this fact a great performance.Colin Farrell surpasses himself and it's also in itself a performance. The plot is well temperated.Just think what you will do if it happened to you, nothing less or more than what you can see in the film. There is no useless heroism like in most of the Hollywood movies, no smarter guy, no super cop, no super hero, no moral and a very good movie at the end. For once, Hollywood shows no more than the reality and I hope we will be able to see more movies like that !</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>For a couple of years now (since Tigerland) Colin Farrell has been much vaunted as the next big thing but with the exception of his supporting role in Speilberg's Minority Report, Farrell's subsequent additions to his CV have hardly enhanced his reputation. Movies such as Hart's War and The Recruit have left both audiences and critics somewhat underwhelmed, whilst the release of Phone Booth was much delayed due to the real life Washington snipers mindless killing of innocent people. <p>So what of Phone Booth: Is it any good and does Colin Farrell deserve the tag of next big thing? <p>Farrell plays Stu Shepard a slimy, unscrupulous, and very small time, Manhattan PR man with a daily habit of using the same old fashioned phone booth to call a prospective client (Katie Holmes) with whom he is trying to start an affair with. After all he wouldn't want his wife to see a mobile phone bill listing calls to other women, would he? Enticed into picking up the ringing phone, Stu becomes trapped by an unseen sniper who tells him that he will be killed if he tries to leave the booth or puts down the phone. 'What do you want?' demands Stu,  'I want your complete attention' replies the sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) and not only does he get Stu's complete attention he gets the audiences too as we watch Stu unravel into a [weak] mess pleading for his life over the next seventy minutes. <p>With his cocky charm, good looks and uncanny ability to mimic an American accent, Farrell is perfect for the part, which was at one point reportedly earmarked for Will Smith. The Dublin born actor appears to revel in playing the anti-hero forced into confessing his sins by the psycho sniper playing God in order to achieve some form of redemption. There are good supporting performances too from the likes of Forrest Whittaker as the cop in charge at the scene and in particular Kiefer Sutherland as the menacing assassin at the other end of the line.  <p>Written by veteran writer/producer/Director Larry Cohen and Directed by Joel Schumacher, responsible for the very lamentable Batman & Robin, Phone Booth is (in my humble opinion) a very exciting and claustrophobic edge of the seat thriller. Cohen's script and Schumacher's Direction keep the movie lean and tight, steadily cranking up the tension to new heights right up until the movies conclusion. Cohen's script is so ingenious in that it takes an old movie premise (the irresistible ringing phone that has to be answered and the anonymous caller) and gives it a new spin. It's almost hard to believe that this is the same Joel Schumacher responsible for the last two movies of the Batman franchise. Indeed this is very much a return to form for the man that brought us the urban thriller "Falling Down". Keeping you hooked throughout its (by current standards) relatively short running time, it is refreshing to see the old adage that less is sometimes more once again proved true. <p>..., this is top-drawer entertainment and the best thriller I've seen in a long while. There are certainly much worse ways to spend 81 minutes, so take my advice and give this one a try, I'm sure you wont regret it!!! Four stars ****.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Phone Booth has gotten mixed reviews, ... but ..., I really liked it. Yeah, it could have been cut, with perhaps the saved time being used to develop further the relationship with the mistress [hopeful] and with the wife. But still. I was on the edge of my seat each time that creepy voice on the other end of the line chuckled and commanded the poor guy to reach for the gun overhead. Although the tension was high, the end was predictable - but if for nothing else, the movie is worth watching just for the scenes with the hookers who want that guy OUT of the phone booth.<br />Four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>In the span of 75 minutes, the directors of "Phonebooth" have packed a ton of fast-paced psychological suspense that will be sure to glue audiences to the screen.  Colin Farrell gives a superior performance as Stu Shepard, a sleazy publicist for struggling actors.  Stu decides to use a phonebooth to make a call and his life changes forever.  While in the booth, the phone rings, Stu answers, and he soon discovers that a psychopath with a high-powered rifle is on the other end.  Soon, Stu is begging for his life as the caller (Kiefer Sutherland) asks Stu to answer questions about his infidelity to his wife Kelly, played by Radha Mitchell, his infatuation with Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes), a young actress he has become involved with, and also bearing his soul to other things as well.<p>Meanwhile, a group of hookers try to get Stu out of the phonebooth, but he won't leave.  Finally, the pimp comes over to try, but he ends up getting shot by the caller.  Instantly, the hookers think that Stu is the shooter, and soon the phonebooth is surrounded by police and SWAT team members.  Captain Ramey, played by Forrest Whitaker, attempts to talk Stu out of the phoneboot, but to no avail.  Finally, Stu is able to alert the police with his cell phone about the sniper.<p>This is an excellent DVD.  The pop-up screens really help the viewer follow the action more closely.  Colin Farrell, Forrest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes all give excellent performances throughout the movie.  The viewer only gets to see Kiefer Sutherland briefly at the end, but his voice really makes the caller scary and menacing.  Watch this highly entertaining psychological thriller.  You'll never want to use a phonebooth again.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>Joel Schumacher's "Phone Booth," delayed first because star Colin Farrell wasn't famous enough to open the film to substantial box office and then pushed back because the Beltway Sniper attacks made the film too topical to release, was compelling while I was watching it, but it has had no staying power with me whatsoever.<p>It's not a bad movie. It's very simple, very brief and occasionally thrilling. It goes exactly the way you expect it will, not needing to extend far beyond its simple premise of a morality play. A gunman, judging people at random from the sky, decides to make Farrell's tacky agent character face up to his sins. If he doesn't, he'll be dead ... or the friends who've gathered to watch his incident will be killed. So he stays on the phone and confesses to save everyone. <p>Of course, the people around him also think that he's a crazed gunman, and he can do little to convince them otherwise. Therein lies the most interesting aspect of the film, one that the filmmakers don't exploit near enough.<p>I remember an episode of "Homicide: Life of the Streets" that had a similar premise to this one, and I think the "Homicide" episode was slightly better than this movie.<p>But, compared to the travesties Joel Schumacher has subjected upon movie audiences in the past, "Phone Booth" was merely slight - not offensive.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A phone call can change your life, but for one man it can also end it. Set entirely within and around the confines of a New York City phone booth, thriller follows Stu Shepard, a low-rent media consultant who is trapped after being told by a caller - a serial killer with a sniper rifle - that he'll be shot dead if he hangs up.A sudden and shocking act of violence near the booth draws the attention of the police, who arrive backed with a small army of sharpshooters. They believe that Stu, not the unseen caller of whom they remain unaware, is the dangerous man with a gun.The senior officer on the scene, Captain Ramey, tries to talk Stu out of the booth. But unbeknownst to Ramey, his team, the media circus that has flocked to the site - and Stu's wife, Kelly, and his client /prospective girlfriend, Pamela - the caller has them all in his high-powered rifle sights. As afternoon turns into evening, Stu, the embodiment of an unethical, self-serving existence, must now undertake a sudden and unexpected moral evolution. He is emotionally stripped naked by the caller. Stu's lies, half-truths, and obfuscation no longer matter. Instead, he must dig deep into his soul, find his strength and attempt to outwit the caller, taking the game to an even more dangerous level. This movie is one of the best thrillers in years high concept, original, and completely unpredictable.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>"Isn't it funny? You hear a phone ring and it could be anybody. But a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?" This particular line, when used outside of the context of the movie, appears to be nothing more than a rudimentary observation of a typical human inclination. However, this very same line when spoken by actor Keifer Sutherland, with his distinctly recognizable voice that has instilled fear into many a terrorist on TV's "24", takes on a creepy and ominous tone. With this one line of dialogue the movie, "Phone Booth", quickly kicks into high-gear and embarks upon a taut, tense thrill ride that will no doubt leave most audience members questioning whether or not they will answer a ringing public phone ever again.<br /><br />"Phone Booth" focuses on one really bad day in the life of publicist Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) as his day goes from average to terrifying with one phone call. On the other end of the line is a deadly accurate sniper with a high-powered rifle aimed right at Stu. If Stu hopes to make it out of this ordeal alive he must do exactly what the caller dictates; if not, then his next breath could be his last.<br /><br />Making a movie where your main character is forced to spend the better part of 90 minutes stuck in essentially one spot would seem to not only be a hard sell to the actor or actress playing the role, but also to the director, supporting cast members, and any potential studio looking at bankrolling and/or distributing the film. I mean, seriously how can this premise actually sustain an audiences interest for that long, while remaining believable and on top of that, maintaining a high level of suspense? I suppose one could say that making a movie about a man alone on a deserted island with a volleyball for a companion is just as hard, if not harder to sell. Yet, that particular movie ("Cast Away" for those that either don't recall or weren't aware) actually did well with both critics and audiences, proving that this type of film can work when done properly. All I can say is that clearly director Joel Schumacher ("A Time to Kill"), along with his cast, crew, and screenwriter, knew precisely what they were doing, thus creating an incredibly intense movie experience centered around one of the most mundane locations known to man... a phone booth.<br /><br />Written by Larry Cohen, a writer who may have an affinity for all things phone related (another movie he wrote was titled "Cellular"), the story takes an interesting, albeit potentially boring and problematic, concept that could have been riddled with clich&eacute;s and unoriginality, and turns it into a sleek, inventive, fast-paced thriller. One particular aspect I enjoyed about this film's story is that it gives the audience enough of a taste of what Stu is like as a man prior to his ordeal, and then cleverly reveals more character details and flaws throughout the phone conversations. This method could have made the additional character development feel wedged into the story as an obvious means of exposition that would cause the pace to slow down; however, Cohen has weaved the details throughout the film in a way that never feels forced or unnatural within the context of the various phone calls.<br /><br />Another aspect of the story that worked really well (and increased the tension for the audience), was the realism inherent in the story. The fact that the bulk of the movie takes place within such an ordinary and mundane setting, like a phone booth, makes what is occurring all the more frightening because it actually could happen to one us. The best scares movies have ever given to audiences almost always revolve around events and/or settings that most of us either encounter or potentially could in our normal day-to-day lives. It is the familiarity of the surroundings and the realistic nature of the threat in "Phone Booth" that amplifies our dread to a much greater degree than anything most horror films can ever hope to achieve.<br /><br />Headlining this relatively small primary cast of characters is the ever-capable actor Colin Farrell ("American Outlaws"). Colin has proven over the course of several films during his relatively short career that he is an extremely talented actor and one that can hold his own with the biggest stars in the business. To my knowledge, "Phone Booth" is the first movie in which Colin must carry the lion's share of the film's workload alone. As with any actor or actress, a film such as this will test just how skilled an individual they truly are. With Colin's stellar performance in this movie he easily proves his worth to not only audiences, but critics as well.<br /><br />Alongside Colin in the supporting roles for the film are actors Forest Whitaker ("Phenomenon") and Keifer Sutherland (TV's "24"). Forest Whitaker brings more depth and believability to his character than the typical one-dimensional take the script seemed to provide. It is Whitaker's warmth that exudes from the character's initial conversations in the movie that makes him more relatable and balances out the otherwise cold and unforgiving nature of the rest of the police force depicted in the film.<br /><br />Keifer Sutherland delivers one of the most chilling villainous portrayals in modern cinema, at least in my opinion. What's most impressive about this performance is that it was acted predominantly through voice-over or in this case, phone calls. Surprisingly, this approach for showcasing the film's main antagonist didn't weaken the portrayal one bit. It is quite an achievement for an actor to make his presence feared throughout an entire movie without being seen for a majority of the duration. Keifer's gruff and menacing voice work in this film is unsettling enough, but his character's nonchalant approach to what he's doing is perhaps the most terrifying of all. Nothing is more disturbing than a villain that believes he or she is justified in whatever actions they may take, and Keifer's performance absolutely personifies that frame of mind.<br /><br />Lastly, actresses Radha Mitchell ("Man on Fire") and Katie Holmes ("Batman Begins") are left with little more to do than just look good on camera and provide some added tension to a couple of moments within the film. Between the two, Radha's character of Kelly, Stu's wife, is given a few brief moments of development and importance within the film; however, even then her scenes really didn't add all that much to the proceedings. Truth be told, I thought both actresses' characters, or at least Katie's character of Pam, could have been left out of the story and only be referred to in the conversations without sacrificing any of the intensity or excitement. In the end, both roles felt like nothing more than afterthoughts within the script.<br /><br />With a screenplay rife with tension, solid performances from the cast especially star Colin Farrell, and a real world setting that makes the whole ordeal all the more startling to the audience; "Phone Booth" is an excellent thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.<br /><br />"Phone Booth" is rated R for pervasive language, brief violence, and sexual references.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Wow, this was a lot better than I anticipated. Oddly, even though it's only 80 minutes long, I think this could have been better with about 10 minutes chopped off. It starts to repeat itself too much near the end. You have to remember, almost the whole film takes place within a phone booth!<br /><br />Colin Farrell does a super job playing a sleazy guy held captive in the phone booth by a threatening sniper-caller. The story, although simple, holds your attention because there is great suspense, innovative camera-work, an involving story that hooks you in pretty fast and some great sound. I hope you have a surround sound system because the caller's (Keifer Sutherland) voice on the other end of the line is something to hear!<br /><br />There is a big moral message in this film, too, about doing the right thing and paying for your sins, which Farrell sure did. It was really refreshing to hear that message, effectively told.<br /><br />Are there holes in this story? Sure, but it's still good and has a cool ending. The only warning I would give readers here is the language: this is a very profane film with Farrell going overboard on the f-word. If that offends you, then stay out of this phone booth; otherwise, it's pretty entertaining</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Phone Booth Colin Farrell is a suspensful thriller and of course more than half of the film is based aroung a disturibing phone booth call. Kiefer Sutherland supplies the creepy voice as the caller. Katie Holmes isn't the worst actor in this movie, the girl who plays Farrell's annoying wife, jeez she deserved a Razzie Award for that over-the-top performance! Forest Whitaker doesn't get to show his acting chops and by the end you never want to make a call again. This film is a mixed bag for me.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I always liked this movie. It's cool how a snobby publicist named Stu is cheating on his wife, then 'the caller' calls Stu at a phone booth, and if Stu hangs up, the caller will shoot him. The caller does shoot someone and everyone thinks Stu did it, then the police get involved. It's also cool that Stu confesses everything to his wife and everyone watching. I would have liked to see a sequel where the caller makes someone else confess their sins.

Phone Booth falls into the latter category and is well worth getting.<br /><br />OK the plot is very sparse, but what there is is well scripted by Larry Cohen. The film is short (81m) and packs a big punch in that time. The best thing about it is "the caller". Unlike all other sinister phone call films I have seen, the callers voice is crystal clear and this adds another dimension (even if it is a bit unreal).<br /><br />The confessional aspect of the film didn't quite work for me, and there were parts of the final 1/3 of the film that I found a bit contrived. However, the final couple of minutes were a brilliant surprise, especially if you haven't worked out who the actor is playing the caller! You might want to rent it first in case its not your sort of film, but I recommend it anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Let's face it, when Joel Schumacher makes a movie, he can either be pretty dead-on or just way off the page he's not even in the same book (read: Batman and Robin). Taking an incredibly flimsy premise and paper-thin plot and stretching it out to movie length should've been a call for disaster but the fact is that the movie ended up being so gripping makes one think it's anything other than a fluke. Is it Schumacher's direction? Colin Farrell's performance? Or is it that the premise is so original and even neat that it's hard not to be enthralled by it?<br /><br />Stu works in promoting clients in the Big Apple and often goes through rather misleading ways to get what he wants: promises a big bash for a restaurant he owes money to as payment, playing magazines against each other for bigger demand in his client and whatnot. He also has something he wants going on as well: a beautiful client, Pam, who he wants to be more than friends with. Instead of using his cell where his wife, Kelly, can check the calls, he uses a pay phone. Only after, he gets a call: a man(voiced by Keifer Sutherland of 24) is watching him and worse: he's got a sniper rifle. Stu has to figure out how to please the sniper and not get shot while also trying to do nothing that'll get policemen to fire at him.<br /><br />That's basically the entire plot: man in a phone booth talking to a sniper and on occasion people in the crowd such as Radha Mitchell of Silent Hill (Kelly) Katie Holmes (Pam) or the police captain played by Forest Whitaker. Why Keifer's character would spend his time on someone who hasn't committed adultery yet is strange but at least Colin acts his *** off and makes him completely likable by the end of the film. Known for a sort of intense whispering he does on 24, Sutherland basically unleashes his malevolence on Stu and it's so fun. Why they bothered though with Katie Holmes is beyond me since she barely has any significant lines and after awhile she just stares at stuff.<br /><br />Now of course the film has holes such as little plot holes or annoyances (a group of hookers needs a phone so they bother with the one Stu's stuck in...as the opening says, there's so many cell phone users or public phones and they just have to bug Stu about his?) But oddly enough the film is actually kind of short. I think my time code said something like an hour and 15 or 17 when the film ended and while there's not much to do with the premise, you get so caught up that you're like "whoa whoa, that's all?"<br /><br />Back in the old days of DVD, many were on what was called a "flipper" meaning one half of the movie on one side, other half on the other. Now, it's been used mainly to separate the fullscreen version and widescreen such as now. While I have no issue with this, the special features are unbelievably small. We get a pretty good commentary by Schumacher that talks about the film but that's it, no making-of's or interviews, not even those back scratching "I love working with that guy, he's so great" EPK's you see on HBO. I'm sure they'll be a double-dip in the future but since it's not a massively liked film I'm sure it'll be awhile.<br /><br />Is it worth your time? Surprisingly yes. It made not be the best film you'll see, but it'll probably be the funnest you've seen in awhile.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>This, along with CELLULAR and RED EYE, makes for a perfect trilogy of suspense.<br /><br />But this one has a style all it's own.<br /><br />Gritty New York Characters, Creepingly sinister voice on the other end, mastered by Keifer Sutherland, and suspense.<br /><br />This particular Killer likes holding a high-powered rifle in one of the surrounding buildings while his victum struggles to stay calm standing in one spot.

Hello, anything could happen! Which, consequently, happens in the film. Pick up the phone and it changes your life.<p>I've seen the trailer about a zillion times, if not more, so finally decided to get it. And despite getting told that it was rubbish, it's too short etc, I really enjoyed it! It's filmed practically in real time, there's not a lot of cast members, and there's not a whole lot of different locations to keep track of. And although I'm disappointed that Colin Farrell speaks with an American accent (I could just listen to him speak all day with his natural, 'Orish' accent!) And Radha Mitchell also appeared in Neighbours years ago, as Mal Kennedy's girlfriend, Catherine I think, and then wife.<p>There's never really a concrete reason as to why the sniper picked Stu - if anyone had answered the phone, would he still have attacked them verbally? Plus, Stu wasn't exactly having a hot, clothes ripping affair with Pam (Katie Holmes) now was he? He was merely fantasising about her - heaven forbid, he should be sent to hell for that! What guy doesn't fantasise about another girl when he's married/engaged/dating/single?<p>I wasn't sure about Kiefer Sutherland as the sniper. What was the point in him over the phone all the time? (I can't think of his voice, but it doesn't sound how I imagined him to sound) The finale seemed a little lame and unsatisfying to be honest. From the trailer, I honestly thought that something serious would happen to Stu. But it didn't. <p>But apart from that, I enjoyed the whole film! And if I ever am near a phone booth, and the phone starts ringing, I will seriously not answer it. Leave it up to someone else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Saw this movie on HBO yesterday, I will have to say the cinematography was a bit strange...but this film kept me guessing what was going to happen next...high action, and almost from the moment that it started!!

Colin Farrell, Forrest Whitaker, and Keifer Sutherland give great performances in this film.<p>I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat the entire time!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>You have to take care with Joel Schumacher. After all, he was responsible for the transformation of  the dark and gothic Batman stories into colorful little adventures (with nipples). In fact, after "Falling down (1993)", Schumacher's career seemed to be falling apart, even if he had opportunity to work with good scripts ("Time to kill" and "8mm") and good actors (Nicholas Cage, Robert deNiro, Anthony Hopkins).<p>The thing is, "Phone booth" worked very well with me. Up-coming superstar Colin Farrell, once again being comprehensible as an american character, is Stu Shepard, a busy PR in New York City. He's married, and has a girlfriend. So that his wife doesn't find out he's calling the girlfriend on the cell phone, he makes those "low profile calls" on a phone booth. The story of "Phone booth" develops as Stu is leaving the phone booth after calling the girlfriend; then the phone rings, and he's compelled to pick it up. After that, he's drawn into a nightmare appearently without any reason to be happening. <p>Simply made, filmed in only 12 days, "Phone booth" makes you seat on the edge of the seat the whole 90 minutes. Almost the entire story revolves around the booth. Schumacher uses a resourse you've seen plenty in Brian dePalma's movies: dividing the screen in aas many as four sections, so you can see different angles of what is happening at the same time. This works very well. Also, Kiefer Sutherland's voice as the sniper, the good performance by Farrell, together with good but smaller performances by Forrest Whitaker (as the negotiation cop) and pretty Katie Holmes (as Stu's girlfriend) make the movie go in a crescendo of thrilling sensations and exquisite feelings that are a pre-requisite for a good movie with the purpose of "Phone booth". <p>You will only be able to think after the movie. While you are watching, pay attention, so you won't loose anything. Schumacher got it right this time. <p>Grade 9.0/10</p></br></body></html>

The title is simply my very quick assessment of "The Host".  If you've already seen this film, you probably were nodding your head when you read my title (with a little luck, you giggled or snickered).  If you have not viewed this film before then you probably thought I was trying to be sublime.  Sorry about that.  I suppose the polite thing to do would be to explain;<br /><br />-COOL MONSTER<br />The monster is very interesting and well executed.  It is seamlessly integrated into the live action and very convincing visually.  Unlike many monster films, "The Host" does not have a monster theme song or warning; it usually appears when things are quiet.  In fact, the director did a good job of "zoning-out" the viewer when the monster appears.  Like in real life, when in a state of astonished shock, time slows down and everything gets numbingly quiet until we zone-in again.  On the downside, I thought that an aquatic mutation would not be quite as intelligent as this beast and it was just a little too indestructible for most of the film.  However, the overall execution was very effective.<br /><br />-SILLY PEOPLE.<br />First of all, let me state that I am an American.  I've never been to Korea nor am I an expert on Korean culture (I know very little).  So I can't really judge how typical these characters were.  That said, most of them were just a little overblown and hammy.  There was no attempt at camp, its all played pretty straight so this was a problem.  Good performances to lookout for are the little school girl whom I enjoyed quite a bit, and her Grandfather who at least seamed genuine.  Most of the other main subjects were sort of caricatures rather than characters.  The American characters were scripted and acted just horribly and the obvious villains (even more so than the monster who is played as more of a consequence of the evil Americans than an evil unto itself).  There is one American hero type but he's not very effective.  I must admit enjoying the family dynamics of the featured characters even if I didn't like them and despite a little too much of them.<br /><br />-BRIDGES AND TRAILERS<br />Again, I know nothing of life around Seoul, Korea.  I have to assume there are lots of bridges and trailers based on this film.  It was definitely an interesting backdrop for a monster movie; particularly the bridges.  The bridges were used mostly as artistic graphic elements; employing triangulation, perspective and geometry to create visually stunning imagery.  I have to give credit for top notch cinematography in this film.  It was a visual treat and actually above the story and characters deployed.  The trailers were effective in that they provided very little sense of security, being what they are.  The bridges get 5 starts, the trailers 3.<br /><br />THE DVD<br />-I bought the 2 disc set.  I have yet to watch disc 2.  However, disc one had quite a few extras itself including a bunch of deleted scenes.  The picture and sound were good So this is a pretty good value.<br /><br />-ADD IT ALL UP...<br />... and you have a strange mix of brilliant visual FX, beautiful cinematography, uneven acting and a slightly bloated story.  The idea of formaldehyde mutating aquatic life to such a degree is something you will need to overlook to enjoy this film(I did immediately) .  You also better be ready to see Americans stereotyped as despicable opportunists without a thought for the consequences of their actions.  I thought it was more comical than offensive.  I never found this film too scary or gory; it's more of a drama. It has some seriously slow spots and somewhat unnecessary character development and a rather heavy handed political statement (I think it was the Directors attempt at being sublime). I found the monster scenes to be enthralling and entertaining and the overall visuals worthy of a better script.  I thought it was ok.  I definitely recommend "The Host" as a rental at least.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>Let us be clear this is not a Hollywood-style action movie. So, if you're anticipating fast-paced action from the beginning till the end, you'll be disappointed. It does have a lot of action scenes, but they're not as fast and furious as American- made films. The special effect of the monster is very good (4/5) but it does not look as scary as the ones in other pictures. It's not a comedy or horror either. It's more like a drama.<br /><br />This film emphasized  family relationship. It depicts the strong bond between family members. It's so powerful that everybody was willing to sacrifice himself/herself  to save the other. In the film, you can see the grandfather, the aunt and other people did everything they could, including risking their lives to save the young girl from the monster. You will also see the father asking other members to love his brother who was intellectually underdeveloped. He said something approximately like this "Love him for who he is. Do not make fun of him".<br /><br />If your family already had a member with terminal disease or disabilities of any kind, you'll feel related to this movie. It will remind you how heart-wrenching it was to watch your loved one dying even though everybody had tried everything. Or it will make you recall how painful it was to struggle everyday to find a way to help your disabled relative to be "normal". This movie helped open up conversations between my family members, my friends and me. After watching it, we discussed how the characters treated each other and how we shoul treat our love ones. It warmed up our hearts.<br /><br />If you think movies these days just contain explosions, and nonsense killing, then this movie is for you. It's certainly worth buying. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />South Korea's highest grossing film of all time "The Host", a new monster film, takes this genre to levels unknown previously with films like "Godzilla" and "The Blob". It represents a significant advancement in the technology and a lesser advancement in narrative.<br /><br />Seoul, 2000. An American army doctor (Scott Wilson) orders his assistant, a native South Korean, to dump bottles and bottles of formaldehyde into the drain, a drain running into the Han River, the major river running through the middle of Seoul. The reason? The bottles are covered with a layer of dust and the army doctor really dislikes dust. The assistant protests, but soon relents. Six years later, a food cart operator, Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) falls asleep every time his dad, Hie-bong (Hie-Bong Byeon) is away from the stand for more than a few minutes. Soon, his daughter, Hyun-Seo (Ah-sung Ko) returns from school and they watch his sister compete in an archery tournament on television. Father and daughter are more like friends; Gang-du even seems to be a bit mentally challenged, like he is at the same level of maturity as his daughter. Then a monster appears in the river and starts to attack the people lounging by the side of the river. Gang-du and Hyun-Seo are chased by the beast and Dad tries valiantly to save his daughter, but the beast soon captures her and drags her away. Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae), the sister, returns from the tournament and they are joined by their brother, Nam-il (Hae-il Park), a young businessman annoyed at the distraction. They receive a call from the daughter's cell phone and try to rescue her, fighting the local authorities, the police, the US Army (?) and ultimately, against the large monster.<br /><br />Directed by Joon-ho Bong, the rights to "The Host" have already been purchased for an American remake, and it is easy to see why. The film's monster elements are well-done, interesting and exciting. But the film suffers from a few uneven performances and some heavy handed political statements which ultimately slow down the proceedings.<br /><br />From what I understand, the initial event is based on an actual event. The Korean government attempted to prosecute the guilty American, but the US wouldn't hand over the man in question. According to IMDB, he was finally convicted in 2005, but didn't serve a prison term. I always believe that a fantasy, science fiction, horror film, anything that is not normally something we would experience is more believable, has roots in reality. "Pan's Labyrinth" is a great recent example of this; the fantasy world was rooted in the very real world of Spain during the last days of the Civil War. These elements of reality help us associate the more fantastical elements of these stories, making us more willing to accept them. While watching the film, I didn't know that something like this actually happened, but I believed it, because it was convincingly done and seemed like something that could happen.<br /><br />The monster, created by a special effects studio in San Francisco, is a very unusual thing. Part fish, part eel, part guppy and part frog, multiplied by a thousand (the suckers big and looks like a large "Alien"), the Monster initially appears hanging from underneath a bridge. People notice the thing and, curious, move closer to get a look. Then it drops into the water and swims towards the people. Moments later, attack.<br /><br />The first time the Monster runs rampant is exciting and fun to watch. The beast moves fast and wreaks havoc on a small leisure area, where people are lounging in the sun next to the river. Naturally, Gang-du and his family will be in the center of the action, they are our entry into this world. The monster chases people back and forth, takes a few, but Gang-du tries to elude the beast, tries to keep his daughter safe.<br /><br />The monster is fearsome, and dangerous, making it a little scary. Because it is fast, this adds to the suspense. You never know when or where it will pop up. It also appears to be smart and has a voracious appetite, adding to the scariness of the beast. When it grabs Hyun-Seo, the drama increases because Gang-du naturally fears his daughter is dead, then they receive a cryptic phone message indicating she might still be alive. The family bands together and starts to hunt for her. This leads the individual characters on `hero's journeys' of their own, until they have to come together and work together to fight the beast.<br /><br />As the family comes together, and gets separated, during their battle with the monster, they face various obstacles. Many of these are also presented in a fairly realistic fashion, adding to the heightened level of suspense. Each is tested, some with frightening results.<br /><br />The film is less successful as a political statement against the involvement of the US Government in this country and in this incident. As soon as the animal runs rampant, it attacks a US Citizen who is vacationing. Then the news is filled with stories of a virus the man contracted through the monster. Soon, the US Army has quarantined people, hunting for others who have come into contact with the beast, closing off entire areas and plans to use a chemical called "Agent Yellow", not a very thinly veiled attempt to make a statement against Agent Orange. This is done in a rather sloppy fashion, and not fully integrated into the rest of the story. This brings the rest of the film down. In the big confrontation between the beast and `Agent Yellow', the Army intends to dispense the chemical using a large yellow plastic ball on the end of a crane, which shoots the chemical in a large plume. Hopefully, their targeting system is much more accurate than the contraption looks, it resembles a large tinker toy. Of course, the chemical doesn't have the intended effect and there are many shots of indigenous South Koreans suffering at the hands of the nasty American chemical.<br /><br />These scenes are really more of a distraction, not necessary and detract from the overall quality of the rest of the film. The monster is a neat, unique creation which is scary, threatening and fun to watch. But when the film gets bogged down with all of the politics, it loses focus.<br /><br />I didn't really get what Kang-ho Song was trying to do as Gang-du. Initially, we see he is lazy and more interested in cutting corners than helping to make a success out of the family's food van, very antithetical to the South Korean way of life. But when his daughter shows up, I initially thought he was an older, less intelligent brother. He seems to want to have this type of relationship with his daughter, but he really seems more mentally challenged than anything else. This is clearly done to make his actions throughout the rest of the film appear all the more heroic, but his portrayal is initially inconsistent.<br /><br />During the last act, when the family has to come together again to defeat the creature, the film shifts again, delivering on the premise of the earlier story.<br /><br />"The Host" is a good film, which benefits greatly from advanced special effects and suspenseful storytelling, but it suffers from an almost sophomoric attempt to make a political statement, slowing down the pace of the story, and interrupting the flow of horror, suspense and excitement.<br /><br />I wonder if the American remake will have some sort of reference to terrorists trying to take over the water supply of St. Louis and they inadvertently create this beast who roams through the upper Mississippi river.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Host" is an unusual, farcical monster movie that became the highest-grossing South Korean film ever. Inspired by the recent SARS panic and an incident of improper disposal of chemicals on a U.S. military base in South Korea, director and co-writer Joon-ho Bong has created an anti-authoritarian polemic exploring the implications of paranoia and regimentation in a free society, with a lovable dysfunctional family at its heart. "The Host" doesn't confine its parody to the bad guys. It skewers every stereotype it introduces, most obviously action movie heroes and the Korean model of order and efficiency.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to the citizens of Seoul, toxic chemicals dumped by an American scientist has spawned a strange creature in the Han River. It emerges from the water one day to terrorize and consume picnickers on the river bank. Gang-du Park (Kang-ho Song), the slacker, narcoleptic son of a snack food vendor, loses track of his daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko) in the hysteria, and she is carried off by the monster. Grieving families of victims are quarantined for fear they have acquired some contagion from the monster. After a phone call from Hyun-soe claims that she is trapped in a sewer, Gang-du, grandpa Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon), disillusioned drunkard uncle Nam-il (Hae-il Park), and archery medalist aunt Nam-joo (Du-na Bae) break out of quarantine and to rescue Hyun-soe.<br /><br />Unlike most monster movies, "The Host" shows us the monster up front. It's an ugly beast, but its grace and acrobatics make it very watchable. "The Host" doesn't try to be menacing or suspenseful, and it rejects many predictable monster movie cliches. It tends more toward allegorical farce than action. The family is searching for Hyun-seo; the authorities are looking for the fugitive family; and everyone is hunting the monster. Yet the bigger menace is misinformation wielded by fear-mongering bureaucrats to restrict the lives of the citizenry. Some scenes overstay their welcome, and "The Host" runs too long, but its funny and entertaining if you like farce and don't mind camp. In Korean with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2007 single disc): Bonus features are deleted scenes, deleted news clips, one featurette and an audio commentary. "Director Bong Joon-Ho's Reflections" (5 1/2 min) is, oddly, a series of apologies by the director to the actors whose scenes were cut, who were unrecognizable, who suffered discomfort, etc. There is an audio commentary by writer-director Joon-ho Bong and English friend Tony Raines. The commentary is in English, in interview format, with Raines asking Bong questions about the film. This works well and produces a constant commentary. They discuss actors, settings, characters, themes, the monster, plot points, and more. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in English.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Films that try to do too much either hit the nail on the head or miss it by a mile.  This ambitious work misses its mark by a few yards rather than a mile.<br /><br />I had read many glowing reviews for this film and I sincerely wanted to like it, but this film is such a diverse mixed bag that it just doesn't work for me.  While the comedic elements are hysterically funny, they seems far too slapstick and way out of place in this kind of film and it doesn't matter if the film is meant to be campy or not.  The satirical components of the film are just too strong when subtly would have had more of an impact.  The dramatic scenes lose their potency amid the humor and satire.  There are times when this kind of juxapositioning can work well, but this film's writer and director just aren't that polished to pull off this complex and ambitious goal of making us laugh and feel a sense of tragedy at the same time.<br /><br />The film's actors are okay, but nothing really memorable except the elder father who is completely likable in his role.  The effects are above average, but the creature is a bit funny looking.  I mean, I actually giggled at it.  It looked something like what would occur if a giant squid got it on with a steroid infected piranha somehow.  Needless to say it never came close to scaring me as much as the shark in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a> did in which this picture claims to be on par.  That was a poor marketing stragedy as very very few "us against it" films ever reach the "Jaws" level of filmmaking.<br /><br />Overall, this film was interesting if for no other reason than it tries to be different and attempts to include more and not less and that is a worthy goal; however, "more" should be attempted by those with more skill and finesse than those who made this effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A238M34Z3X2IBD.html">A238M34Z3X2IBD</a><br/><p>THE HOST has one thing going for it, an agile, almost logical, monster... and that's it.<br /><br />When it's on screen, when it's moving, when it's putting the bite on people or snatching the same people up and storing them in its own version of a CRISPER drawer, there is a lot to admire in this import.  The monster's first full on screen appearence is a marvel to behold, not only because it takes place during daylight hours (very rare for these types of films), not only because it takes place within a large crowd of people, but everyone and everything involved moves in a logical fashion.  From the frist sighting to final snatch and splash, it all looks like something that could very well happen.  Wonderfully done.<br /><br />As for the rest... get a pen, get a pad of paper and be prepared to take notes because little next to nothing makes any kind of sense.  The central players in THE HOST is a family seemingly put together from a series of other unproduced films.  There's the father who looks like a grandfather, two sons - one, a pudgy, bulky, slow witted father himself, the other a miracle of the Korean education and political system.  He's a lawyer in training, a corporate raider, a student, a eco/bio protester who's sister just happens to be a Olympic level athelete in the field of archery (taking the Bronze at the beginning of the film).  It's almost like a skewed version of the FANTASTIC FOUR, everyone seems to have some kind odd "gift" that sets them apart from the rest.<br /><br />There is also the daughter of the pudgy, bulky slow witted father who seemes to have gotten all her looks and good sense from her mother - which, for a film like this is a good thing.  It's her smarts that help her to survive and a mother's strength that allows her to make the ultimate sacrifice.  There's an unhappy ending here in THE HOST, but you'll have a hard time either understanding it, or feeling bad about it, because the rest of the film is mired in protest... against the government, against corporations, against posions, against any and everything it can lay its hands on.<br /><br />THE HOST is one busy film.  Actually, it's more like six films running at once and that's its main flaw, it doesn't know what it wants to say and instead of putting its focus squarely on a family in peril and a monster on the loose, it tries too hard to sum up Korea's political, social and corporate strife.  It's just too much of everything... and because of that THE HOST will go down as a missed oppurtunity to redefine the genre.  But, for the short time the monster is the star of the picture, it works... but not enough to earn a place on your shelf.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This is a well made Korean monster movie. It's got humour and lots of great scenes. This is topnotch sci fi really and it's a fast paced movie. This was a hit movie in korea and was good enough to be shown over here. We need double features back because good movies like this one need a outlet here. The acting is very good too. On blu ray this looks great and it's a newer movie and that helps. It harkens back to the old monster on the loose movies and in this case the monster just wants to live actually. A fine flick that the korean's loved and so do I. It has english subtitles as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>"The Host" reminded me of those Godzilla movies I enjoyed watching as a child.  Godzilla began his long, illustrious career as a bad lizard but later became a good guy when he battled giant, grotesque creatures, such as the Smog Monster, that were the products of man's pollution.  The special effects have improved since the sixties and seventies, but we still know the voices are dubbed.  The plot for "The Host" is just as comical and unrealistic as the Godzilla movies, but the heart pounding excitement during the creature attacks remains the same.<br /><br />  Most of the excitement, unfortunately, takes place near the beginning of the movie.  Once in a while we are treated with a creature attack but they are few and far between.  Family loss keeps the action moving.  A family's loss over their daughter/niece/granddaughter who was snatched by the creature and taken beneath the water.  However, there is light at the end of the tunnel (or sewer in this case) when the father receives a cell phone message from his daughter and the search begins.  The family must battle military police and doctors as they escape a quarantine and race for the sewers beneath a bridge where the creature was last seen.  There are moments of humor throughout the movie to prevent it from becoming too dark and depressing.<br /><br />  It is interesting to watch a foreign film, especially a horror one involving a monster.  However, the closed captions for the DVD did not match what the actors were speaking in English.  Neither did the English subtitles which, I assumed, were a more precise translation for the Korean language.<br /><br />  I would have given this movie four stars if there had been other creature attacks on large groups of people, such as a bus or a small cruise boat on the Han River.  The ending was disappointing.  Don't expect one that will shock and horrify you.  It ended on a rather dull, mundane note.  However, I do recommend watching this movie if you a fan of the nostalgic Godzilla movies, creature features, or "nature gone wild." genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Bong Joon-ho's The Host is undoubtedly one of the best and original monster movies to come along in quite some time.  Taking place in South Korea, The Host revolves around a lazy narcoleptic (Song Kang-ho) who, along with his father, alcoholic brother, and archer sister, unite to save his young daughter who was kidnapped by the giant, reptilian/amphibian mutant beast after it's initial rampage; which is also undoubtedly one of the most unforgettable moments to ever grace a movie of this type.  In between all of the slight cracks towards governments and frantic monster mayhem, The Host is a smart and frequently entertaining blast that surprisingly manages to deliver like no monster movie has before in years.  The CGI effects are mostly great, and the slight moments of humor offer a nice change of pace as well.  The only real flaw of The Host is that the film is too long for its own good.  It would have worked better had it only been an hour and a half as opposed to two full hours.  That aside, The Host is a real treat for monster movie fans looking for something surprisingly good, and by all means is more than worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>The host is not original but it is fresh compared to the torture horror of the last few years.  Fans of 50's horror movies, Korean cinema, Jaws, Godzilla, Japanese monster movies, and monster movies in general will enjoy.<br />Because of a superior officer (Scott Wilson) ordering an underling to dump tons of toxic chemicals down a drain which leads to the Han River, years later a creature appears resembling what James Cameron's "Aliens" would look like if they were amphibious.  Like this years Hills Have Eyes 2 this is a monster our government created like the mutants and like our real enemies in Afghanistan and now is our nightmare.<br />This creature appears on the shores and attacks the people capturing a young girl.  Her dysfunctional family ala Little Miss Sunshine set out to get her back while having to break free of soldiers themselves.  The Government claims this creature is "The Host" of an unidentified virus and wants to quarantine everyone, using the fear tactic which has become famous in our society over the years.<br />There are scares in The Host but nothing along the lines of the nasty torture porn there basically innocent in comparison.<br />Two questions come to mind while watching is this ghastly monster scarier then the monsters in the Government in the film, at times the Han River, home to a beast seemed safer.  The other question, and i believe a metaphor, is the U.S. Government's presence helping or more likely hurting the cause?

Some believe it to be one of the greatest foreign films in recent years, while others see it as one of the most influential monster movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I found this movie to be very mediocre. I didn't find the politics in the film distracting (the satire is pretty sharp here), but I did find the tone of the film very confusing. It tries to be a monster movie, a political thriller, a comedy, a family sitcom, and a drama all at the same time. It doesn't work here: these genres are all over the place, and it's a very unbalanced result. I did care about the characters, because they are really ordinary people like us. They act like how would really act when we come face to face with a dangerous beast. But the big problem here is when the young girl is kidnapped by the monster, and that was not a good idea. This plot thread has been recycled so many times in thrillers, action adventures, and horror flicks. And when it's used here, it feels very tired and uninteresting. The CGI effects of the monster itself look very realistic, and the monster itself looks really unique and threatening at times. It's proof that not ever monster has to be very gigantic like Godzilla. The best parts of the film occur in both the beginning and ending. Both are intense and dramatically powerful. Overall, I would like to have given this film at least four stars, but seeing how the story is a bit pretentious (and the tone of the film being unbalanced) it leaves me no choice but to bring it down a notch. I honestly didn't like the film very much, but it still kept my interest until the end.<br /><br />Grade: C-</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>One of the best monster movies ever made - up there with the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H30B2C">King Kong - Extended Cut (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a> - "The Host" is the kind of movie that reminds you why you love movies so much in the first place.  Successfully combining so many of the elements that make filmdom great - an engaging story, tremendous visuals, memorable characters, great thrills and horror, even a surprisingly large dose of humor - this is one for the ages, one that's still going to be vital viewing twenty or fifty years from now.<br /><br />  In Seoul, South Korea, the careless disposal of chemicals from a military base years ago - allegedy harmful-but-common substances like formeldahyde, but you have to wonder if that's really all it was - ends up creating catastrophic consequences in the modern day.  At a busy stretch of coast along the Han River, populated by picnic spots, bustling foodstands and the like, a crowd gathers, abuzz over a strange sight before them: something black, suspended from a large bridge, something that looks alive.  It's not really a good place to gather though, for the strange thing doesn't plan on staying immobile in its nook in the bridge's understructure.<br /><br />  What starts out seeming like a very charming, slice-of-life/comedy movie, takes on a much more serious tone with the monster's first strike.  The main (human) characters of the movie are all of one family.  A 13 year-old girl is one of the first victims in the attack - seemingly.  But when her devastated father receives a cellphone call from his still-alive child, nobody in authority believes his theory: that the monster - which seemingly ate the girl - swallows its 'prey' into some kind of non-digestive department, then returns home and deposits them in its lair.  The little girl is really the one link holding her family together; some of the family members are estranged from one another, but they all love the child, and all make the bold move of attempting to track her down as a group, themselves becoming fugitives from the authorities in the process.  Meanwhile, there are different groups of authorities - both Korean and international - with their own ideas on how to handle the situation, and there are some possible implications in there, not limited to the idea that some parties are more interested in hiding their own negligence than anything else.<br /><br />  Electrifying, heart-stirring and plausibly done, "The Host" succeeds on all counts.  If you haven't yet come into the world of Asian movies, this is a great place to start (and if this Is your first one, you've got a lot of other treats waitin for you!)  I'd recommend viewing this in the subtitled format, the way I saw it.  There's also an English-dubbed option on the disc, but I've heard that it's not a very good dub job.  Either way you watch it though, this really a major must-see, and one of the best movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>There were a lot of things that I really loved about this movie and a fair number that I did not.  All horror films work within a framework and the most successful of them are original within that framework, not by busting it up.  It is like a competitor in a high diving contest.  If you completely alter form you will get a damning grade.<br /><br />One reviewer described this as a satire.  I think he is mistaking comical elements for satire; the overall form of this film is definitely not satirical.  It is definitely trying to stay within the bounds of the horror film while trying to stretch some of its limits.  For instance, one of the rules in monster movies is that you don't show the monster too soon or too well.  But here the monster is shown only a few minutes into the film and then with great clarity.  You see exactly what it looks like almost as soon as you see it for the first time.  I wasn't too troubled by this because the monster was interestingly and uniquely portrayed.  I was a bit more bothered by the frequent injection of farce (which is what I think the reviewer I mentioned before mistook for satire).  I think comedy properly timed can do a great deal to ease tension and make for a better film, but at times this film almost degenerated into slapstick.  Another traditional element -- and one with which it clashes because of the farce, which almost seems to promise a happy ending -- is the idea of winning.  Every monster movie has to end with a sense of a win.  Few really great monster movies end with all the principle characters dead.  Here most of the characters survive, but the two we care most for in the course of the narrative do not.  At the end of the film it didn't, to me, feel like a "win."  I felt that the monster won.<br /><br />Still, there were a lot of riveting moments in the film.  The locale in Seoul was truly creepy and eerie.  The camera work was simply breathtaking and was as important in establishing the mood of the film as the locale or the special effects (it was shot in high def video instead of film, a practice embraced not only by a number of television series like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but more and more movies).  The monster itself was simply amazing.  I wasn't completely thrilled with its appearance, but there is no questioning how convincing it looked.  It was perhaps the most impressive large monster (except perhaps for Peter Jackson's Kong) that I've seen in a movie.<br /><br />Still, despite the good things, the persistent farcical elements and the "feel bad" ending kept me from liking this as much as I would have liked.  With some tweaking, it could have become a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>I know I've mentioned this to you. "Little Miss Sunshine" meets standard horror movie (except this time it was chemicals, not an atomic explosion, that made the over-sized bug). Really fun!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>Let us be clear this is not a Hollywood-style action movie. So, if you're anticipating quick-paced action from the beginning till the end, you'll be disappointed. It does have a lot of action scenes, but they're not as fast and furious as American- made films. It's not a comedy either. It's more like a drama.<br /><br />This film emphasized  family relationship. It depicts the strong bond between family members. It's so powerful that everybody was willing to sacrifice himself/herself  to save the other. In the film, you can see the grandfather, the aunt and other people did everything they could, including risking their lives to save the young girl from the monster. You will also see the father asking other members to love his brother who was intellectually underdeveloped. He said something approximately like this "Love him for who he is. Do not make fun of him".<br /><br />If your family already had a member with terminal disease or disabilities of any kind, you'll feel related to this movie. It will reminds you how heart-wrenching it was to watch your loved one dying even though everybody had tried everything. Or it will make you recall how painful it was to struggle everyday to find a way to help your disabled relative to be "normal". This movie helped open up conversations between my family members, my friends and me. After watching it, we discussed how the characters treated each other and how we treated our love ones. It warmed up our hearts.<br /><br />If you think movies these days just contain explosions, and nonsense killing, then this movie is for you. It's certainly worth buying. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>I usually rent, but i paid for this flick, cause it was advertized as on<br />par with other good monster movie.  The monster itself is good, detailed<br />and original and is a joy to look at, but the rest of the movie could have<br />been done better.

All horror films work within a framework and the most successful of them are original within that framework, not by busting it up.  It is like a competitor in a high diving contest.  If you completely alter form you will get a damning grade.<br /><br />One reviewer described this as a satire.  I think he is mistaking comical elements for satire; the overall form of this film is definitely not satirical.  It is definitely trying to stay within the bounds of the horror film while trying to stretch some of its limits.  For instance, one of the rules in monster movies is that you don't show the monster too soon or too well.  But here the monster is shown only a few minutes into the film and then with great clarity.  You see exactly what it looks like almost as soon as you see it for the first time.  I wasn't too troubled by this because the monster was interestingly and uniquely portrayed.  I was a bit more bothered by the frequent injection of farce (which is what I think the reviewer I mentioned before mistook for satire).

Stunning as monster movie adventure, the film is mostly a campy and satirical trek through a biological disaster of epic proportions.  Drawing from the recent SARS scare, the film reflects on the repercussions of the clampdown taken to eradicate the disease while keeping the victims under a martial law type quarantine.<br /><br />It all begins in a lab where a young subordinate is working with his older superior.  Noting the bottles of toxins are gathering dust, the elder orders the young man to empty the contents of the lethal substances down the drain.  While many of us would at least try to go over his head, we're not supposed to take it that far as the younger scientist objects to the procedural effects on the Han River.  The narrative then turns to a snack shop owner, Park Hee-bong (Byun Hee bong),  whose daughter, Nam-joo, is an archery champion and a son who is asleep at the counter during his absence.<br /><br />The events that transpire are a real awakening.  Down at the Han River, a mutant cocoon figure hangs by a bridge. People by the riverbank watch in horror as the mass comes to life.  Amphibious by nature (although most descriptions favor a scaly reptilian presence) the monster comes to shore and wreaks havoc throughout the land.  Panic ensues, and the monster either devours or captures its victims.  Tragically, it takes the snack bar owner's granddaughter to a sewer and keeps her captive in its lair.  The fast motion of film skillfully captures the victims in view of the monster as he hunts them down, but the silky smooth slow motion shots also resonate the key moments when the innocent are in peril.<br /><br />From here the narrative lightens up.  We have loopy scenes where those tainted by the monster have acquired a mysterious disease are treated like villains rather than victims.  Newsclips show how the South Korean and American governments clamp down on the affliction like a military conquest.  Becoming fugitives in exile, the family tries to escape quarantine and rescue the girl from the monster's clutches.<br /><br />Distinctive and unique, 'The Host' is thoroughly thought-provoking entertainment, even if it sometimes hits its satiric notes too long and too often.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>After all the great reviews I'd read -- including a particularly persuasive rave in "The New Yorker" -- I was primed to see this horror-comedy about a pollution-bred monster running wild in a Korean sewer system.<br /><br />But despite its smooth look and admirable camerawork, "The Host" is surprisingly uneffective. Aside from the moster's brisk initial attack, the action isn't exciting and the comedy isn't especially funny. In fact, large sections of this film are just boring.<br /><br />I'll take an anti-hero any day of the week, but the family here is so hapless and sad they quickly become maddening.<br /><br />It's great to see a thriller with ambitions beyond the typical PG-13 slasher flicks, or the hard R-rated torture chamber endurance matches, but "The Host" has a long way to go before it's in a league with "Jaws" or "Alien" as some have suggested.<br /><br />Disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>This movie started out great and then quickly fell apart on me. The first real monster scene was incredible. Everyone is standing around looking at this thing on a bridge... and it was pretty freaky. The monster looked great from far away as it dangled off the bridge and the next scene when we actually see the monster attack was awesome! After that it was pretty much downhill. It turned into a movie about the family, all of who were annoying except for the main character who was looking for his daughter. I liked him, but the rest of the family were lame. This movie tried too hard to be funny and to make a social commentary, but it didn't try hard enough to be scary. It wasn't scary at all after the first 30 minutes. The special effects seemed to get worse as the minutes ticked away and there were a few scenes of the monster where it looked so silly and fake that it was disappointing. However there were other scenes of the monster where it looked very cool and ultra creepy. This movie suffers from being uneven and scattered. I can't figure out in my head how to classify this movie... Was it a monster movie? Was it an action movie? Was it a black comedy? Was it a pandemic movie? I guess the answer is that it is all of these things to a certain point, but for my money a monster movie should be about a monster if you want a classic on your hands. This isn't a classic, but it is worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>A good way to judge a movie is to watch it far away from all the hype surrounding it at the time of it's release, especially when its being called just as good as Jaws or Alien (if the hype is that big, you had BETTER be good, or you are doomed).  Getting some distance away from it allows you to see the movie as it is, strengths and flaws, without the cloud of hype settling in over you.  With that in mind, I sat down to watch "The Host", knowing next to nothing about it, save that lots and lots of people were hyping it as the next great monster movie.  When the film faded to black and the credits began to roll, the first thing on my mind was, "That's it?  This is supposed to be as good as Jaws?"<br /><br />Not by a long shot.  Not even close.<br /><br />"The Host" tells the story of a South Korean family who are trying to rescue the youngest member of their family from a giant, mutated monster who has kidnapped and taken the girl to its lair.  With the government scrambling to contain and eliminate the creature, as well as a deadly virus it's carrying, it's up to the family to save the girl themselves.  In the right hands, it's a story that could have been incredibly powerful emotionally, yet falls flat on it's face, turning the film into yet another monster movie with great visual effects, but a dull plot and unlikeable characters.<br /><br />The family, the focus of the film, is a group of misfits, chief among them lazy and overweight dad Gang-du, who spends most of his time yelling, "Hyun-seo!" and running around.  His fellow family members poke fun at him for being an idiot, and he is.  When he's infected with a virus and told not to eat anything, he goes ahead and secretly scarfs down what looks like snail guts.  He breaks out of quarantine with the rest of his family, threatening to spread the infection to the entire city, threatening the lives of millions of people.  And at one point, his idiocy has disastrous consequences for someone else, and that point I just lost interest in him.  I don't care if his daughter is in mortal danger, this man is a complete idiot whom I wanted to die.  I didn't feel any sympathy for him in the slightest.  The rest of his family is a little better.  His older brother, who thinks going around monster hunting as a bad idea, at least has some common sense.  Gang-du's father just wants to get his granddaughter back, which I can understand.  Best of all is Gang's sister, Nam-joo, a national archer who is the most likable character due to the fact that she really doesn't do anything idiotic to begin with.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of the film is that it just feels very loose, and in need of tightening and focusing.  The tone bounces all over the place from horror to surprise to some weird comedy moments.  At times, it just seems to go on for too long and would benefit from editing and shortening the script, as well as cutting out a few characters (like the homeless boys, who's introduction into the story feels jarring and out of place).  The political subplots just don't work at all...the government seems well meaning and trying to take care of things, yet the film has a grudge against the united states.  Not knowing the inspiration behind the jabs at the united states, I found it even more bizarre when a government agent reveals a secret about the virus that left me scratching my head...even more so when a character undergoes completely unnecessary brain surgery that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Ditto for the scene of the armed forces having a barbecue.  I think the film is trying to poke fun at bumbling governments, but I never got the feeling while watching the film.<br /><br />The best thing that can be said about "The Host" is that the creature itself is very cool.  The visual effects are fantastic throughout, and the monster does feel like a creature that could really happen.  The filmmakers also deserve credit for having the monster appear so early and in broad daylight throughout many frequent scenes, and even more credit for making the beast look realistic.  I especially liked seeing a touch of personality in it during a scene in the sewers when Hyun-seo tries to escape.<br /><br />But despite the excellent visual effects, "The Host" fails to impress.  I was never scared or amused when I watched the film, instead feeling only disbelief and anger at how stupid the characters were.  "The Host" ultimitly ends up as yet another monster movie with great visuals but unlikable characters and a dull plot, joining countless other monster movies in the same boat.  The thought of this movie joining ranks with "Jaws" and "Alien" is highly amusing...those two movies have stood the test of time because of having tight, focused stories, and memorable characters who do logical things, both good and bad, in the face of monsters.  While the rubber shark and the rubber suited alien will continue to thrill and enjoy audiences for decades to come, this overgrown tadpole will best be remembered as another example of how a loose and unfocused plot with unlikable characters will kill a movie, no matter how impressive the visual effects may be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>I have no idea why this film is being compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDD">ALIEN</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">JAWS</a>. It is offensively inferior.<br /><br />Basically, there is a Korean family. Then there is this monster who captures the little girl. Family goes after the monster. Monster keeps the girl in its sewer hideout full of other victim's bones. Family finds the monster. Monster is attracted to the city where there's a trap. Monster gets killed.<br /><br />The effects are nicely done and the crowd scenes where the monster runs at large and eats people are very well staged (and must have been expensive to shoot). That explains why there are only two of those big scenes in the entire film.<br /><br />The rest of the film is just the family looking for the monster and little girl hiding from the monster.<br /><br />The film lacks more spectacle (although the little it has is very well done).<br /><br />And the acting is very strange. It is very histrionic... like if everybody were in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JU8H74">Masked Rider</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IU37TI">Ultraman</a> episode. In a way, it looked like those old Japanese TV shows... but made with CGI.<br /><br />I got very disappointed after all the hype.<br />I am sure it worked a lot better with Asian audiences who are more in tune with many elements... like the histrionic acting, some characters, the fact that one of the protagonists is an Olympic bow and arrow winner (a big sport in Korea)... and many other things.<br /><br />Rent. Don't buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this monster movie. Had an awesome monster and a pretty good story. The action scenes were the highlights. The way the monster moved, grabbed people was all very realistic. The monster itself could have used some more CGI work. When it was off in a distance it looked very believable. But when you saw it up close it looked like a cartoon.<br /><br />The story was well done but had a lot of plot holes. The acting was good but I watched it with the English dubbing which was terrible. The people they got to do the voice overs sounded like they belonged doing anime. It was really bad. And the English script didn't always make sense either. It's probably better to watch this movie in it's original Japanese with subtitles. For that reason, I'm giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />But it was really good.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I was one of the audience that's swept away by the hype of this movie.  It's critically acclaimed and also well received by audience world-wide.  The local newspaper stressed us to watch the movie before it's butchered by Hollywood.  So, I did just that.  Perhaps, I went to the cinema with over the top expectation and reality never managed to match that.  Yes, I gave credit to where it's due.  This movie came about because of one actual incident that happened in South Korea where poisonous pollutants were dumped into the Han River.  In other words, The Host was actually not an entertainment movie per say but a protest movie.  Surprise, surprise, the media & the Americans were branded as "villains" of the movie for building up a paranoia akin to the SARS virus that broke up in Asia few years ago and also of the Americans endeavouring to cover up the "problem" that it triggered at the first place, which was rather similar to Hollywood version of Godzilla storyline.  The Host was patchy at best and there were funny moments too.  Having said that, the focal point of the movie was a simple Korean Park family that simply went around living their own lives until they were interrupted by this monster that was a metaphor for the intervening factor in Korea.  Nobody would take heed of the ordeal & believed what they had to say about their missing family member until they had to resort to one another for support.  Don't expect a linear progression of storyline where the monster would be slain and everybody would live happily ever after.  The special effects was mediocre and critics specified that it's to pay homage to B-grade movies.  It's entirely up to audience to decipher what's real and what's deliberate.  Otherwise, a watchable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i really wanted to like this film.but it just wasn't meant to work<br />out.not only was it all over the place in terms of<br />tone.comedy/action/drama/adventure.some of which i'm not sure were<br />intentional.the comedy for instance.there are also couple of scenes<br />that don't seem to belong and are not explained,which really annoyed<br />me.but the biggest obstacle to engaging this movie was that it just<br />went on and on and on.i almost couldn't take it.i watched it to the<br />end.but it was a chore.that was what killed the whole experience for<br />me,was just how slow it was.it it hadn't been for that,i might have<br />enjoyed the movie.the actual creature itself was not that bad looking.i<br />have seen worse,and better.i did like the look of the film.it had a<br />certain style to it.and the ending was touching.i started to watch the<br />film in dubbed English but found the dubbing quality not so good,so<br />quickly switched to Korean with English Subtitles,which i would<br />recommend.i can't really recommend this film based on how long it<br />seemed to take to get through,but if you do choose to watch,just know<br />that you may need a great deal of patience 1.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I'd never heard of this movie so I thought I'd give it a rent.  Big mistake.  The movie is described as a thriller and a comedy, but there is nothing thrilling about it and the only funny thing is how bad the plot and acting are.  Within the first few minutes of the movie, we see the monster.  It looks like a giant tadpole.  There's no build up or suspense like in Jaws or Alien.  Then the troops come in much like a Godzilla vs Smog Monster movie.<br /><br />The rest of the time a family hunts the monster to recover a little girl.  The grandfather is the only decent character.  The brother and sister are mean, while the father of the girl is an annoying idiot.  Bad acting and plot aside, the movie is just plain boring.  I noticed 1 playback glitch on my Toshiba A1 with version 2.3 firmware.  It reminded me of a layer change on a regular DVD.  Otherwise playback was fine and picture quality was good.<br /><br />Next time I gripe about a Hollywood movie, I'll remember this turd and keep my mouth shut.  Don't waste your time on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I felt a bit of skepticism when I heard that the top-grossing film in Korean history was headed to a big screen near me--and (gulp!) it was a "Godzilla" type monster movie. And then the critical reviews started pouring in--let's just say, they're pretty impressive! So intrigued, but still very wary, I headed out to Bong Joon-ho's "The Host." After a brief setup and a quick introduction to an impossibly dysfunctional family, a creature emerges from the Han River and starts to terrorize the citizens of Seoul. And I was hooked! Frightening and funny, the emergence of this indescribable creature (part fish, part "Alien," part unmentionable) is so well staged--I was alternately shocked and amused. From that moment on, "The Host" never let go and became a wildly entertaining ride.<br /><br />The film introduces us to an unlikely group of protagonists--an inept and childlike man (played by Song Kang-ho), his put-upon father, and his school aged daughter. When the creature first attacks the city, the daughter is carried away. Grieving for her, father and son are reunited with Kang-ho's other siblings--a sister who is a competitive archer and a brother, college educated but unemployed. This quartet clearly has issues, and Kang-ho feels guilty for what has happened. After being isolated by the military for having been exposed to the creature (now being reported as the host of an unknown virus), Kang-ho becomes convinced his daughter is still alive. The family bands together and decides to break out and track down the creature's movements in an effort to locate the girl. Equal parts believable family interplay, genuine horror, slapstick, and harrowing moments with surprisingly real consequences--"The Host" is a multilayered film that works on many levels.<br /><br />One of the more questionable critiques that I've encountered about "The Host" is that its anti-American posturing is offensive. This being, first and foremost, a creature feature--I find this a tad oversensitive. The overt acts of villainy perpetuated by the Americans in question (such as the careless dumping of formaldehyde into the environment) are done with such a gleeful, over-the-top tone--it has more of a comedic effect than anything. In cartoons, these scientific or military "villains" would be twirling their mustaches and cackling at an evil plot. And, in fact, the first real "hero" of the piece is an American soldier who stands up to the creature to save others. It's a bit of a double standard, as well. How many times do American films cast another country in the same light (or much worse)? It strikes me as the "you can dish it out, but you can't take it" syndrome if Americans aren't able to take a bit of satiric poking every once in a while from someone else. However, in the main scheme of things--the characters within "The Host" couldn't care less about the political climate. Much of the international relations information is provided as background via TV reports that are generally being ignored!<br /><br />Now that I've made this film sound political, let me just reiterate--it's not. It's wild, it's fun, it's scary, it's unexpected--but most surprisingly, it's also genuinely moving. I actually cared about the central family in "The Host." Ordinary citizens, they are thrust into the role of heroes. They put aside their differences, come together as a family, and sacrifice everything they have for one another. Comedically complicated, they still convey real familial devotion. The forward momentum of the film is provided by love and a commitment to endure any hardship for those close to you. So this B-movie monster flick is grounded by, of all things, heart. I can understand someone not liking "The Host." A monster running amok in a scary movie is not for everyone (and, although, I mention comedic elements a lot--this is a scary movie). But adding the wackiness, the slapstick, and (most especially, for some) the subtitles--you're bound to have your share of detractors. But I found "The Host" great fun. The creature looks awesome and the action scenes, in particular, are riveting. Do yourself a favor, if you're into this type of film--check out "The Host." KGHarris, 03/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The Host is a South Korean film that contains a surprisingly strong sense of character development and even some emphasis on humor.  Ultimately though, The Host will be quickly recognized as one of the most effective monster movies in decades.  I'm not exaggerating; it is a shining example of a film that makes me wonder over and over again while watching it, why doesn't anyone make movies like this anymore?  Evidently, South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho (Memories of Murder) does, and The Host quickly became the highest grossing South Korean film ever made.<br /><br />The Host opens with an American ordering the removal of many gallons of formaldehyde.  He orders his assistant to pour the toxic chemical into the drain, which will ultimately place it into the Han River.  We are then introduced to the protagonists of the film, a South Korean family, two of which run a snack bar in front of the Han River.  A giant creature comes out of the river and snatches up a little girl who is part of this family.  The family grieves her loss while the government converges onto the scene and begins to indicate that the monster may be the cause of a new virus and that anyone who had contact with it should be quarantined.  The family receives some indication that the little girl is alive and so they opt to make an effort to save her.  Many scenes with the monster follow and it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Monster movies of old invoke feelings of fear, excitement, action, and suspense; but have traditionally required more imagination than other genres.  If there is mystery about the monster or we don't see it as much we quickly creep into the horror genre, but The Host does not do this.  If there is no mystery we run the risk of seeing something we don't believe and that is when our imaginations must take over.  The Host doesn't need its audience to do that either.  It is shear madness and we are compelled to believe this is real.  The drama assists tremendously and the comedic aspects serve to make the characters even more enjoyable while placing the film into a fairly convincing frame.  The first time we see the monster is in broad daylight and it attacks crowds of people along the shore, only to submerge again.  There is a moment in Jurassic Park where I felt an amazing sense of hope in great filmmaking combined with great technology.  It is the first time we see the dinosaurs.  Since that time I've grown a bit cynical toward technology's role in film, but The Host reinvigorates that hope.  It is great action, great drama, great comedy, and great horror all mixed together.<br /><br />The front of the box on the DVD indicates that The Host is on par with Jaws.  As someone who believes Jaws to be among the greatest films ever made it would take time to concur with such a statement, but The Host is definitely worth viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>THE HOST (original Korean title GWOEMUL) is a sneakily good film which was a hit in Cannes. Be aware that it contains an environmental message that isn't exactly subliminal and that, also, it shows the U.S. in a very dim light. Nevertheless, I easily got past all that and was soon very immersed in the movie. I really don't know how this film got past my movie radar, but thank goodness it did. I went into this not knowing much about it other than it was ostensibly a creature feature. But it's much more than that. THE HOST manages to integrate a strong family theme, an off the wall sense of fun, and an unpredictable, heartbreaking storyline which kept me on the edge of my seat. I truly did not know what would happen next, and that's a very good thing. As a bonus, this movie is also pretty funny.<br /><br />Some plot SPOILERS.<br /><br />It starts out in a U.S. Army Base morgue in Korea when an American lab technician has his lackey dump formaldehyde down the laboratory drains even though he knows that the toxic stuff will eventually flow into the Han River. Some years later, frequenters on the banks of the Han River witness a grotesque monstrosity shockingly emerge from the river and begin an all out rampage. Survivors of the attack are summarily rounded up by the government which, fearing a creature-initiated virus, then institutes a quarantine and hastily begins conducting tests on the parties involved.<br /><br />One particularly contentious family is very much involved in the doings. Held under quarantine, they are grieving the death of a 13-year-old girl named Hyum-seo, who was seen being carried away by the monster. Her father, the dim-witted Gang-du, receives a call on a cell from someone claiming to be Hyum-seo and that she's alive but being held captive in a hole under a bridge. Gang-du and his kin break away from quarantine and flee into the sewer system and begin their search for Hyum-seo.<br /><br />Meanwhile, time is running out for Hyum-seo. Lacking food and drink and imprisoned in a deep chasm, she knows that her chances are bleak as she now awaits her turn to become crunchy snacks for the creature. A further burden is laid on her shoulders when another survivor, this time a little boy, appears. At last, with hope dwindling faster and faster, she seizes one opportunity for escape.<br /><br />End SPOILERS.<br /><br />Absolutely, the film's star attraction is the beastie itself. But THE HOST focuses more on the quarrelling family members than on the monster, and this works to the film's advantage as we get the chance to know the characters and invest in what happens to them. The dysfunction in this family is never more strongly portrayed than in an early scene where they remain hilariously combative even as they mourn the supposed death of young Hyum-seo. Not to get all On-A-Very-Special-Blossom, but this film goes on to underline the power of kinship and how familial loyalties can overcome personal differences.<br /><br />The monster is part squid, part tadpole, and part Whatdaf--k!!. The thing shows up only sporadically, which serves to heighten the suspense and enhance its effectiveness. Its debut appearance is a freakin' doozy and quite surreal, done in broad daylight with its mangling and ravaging taking place out in the open. Usually, the monster is so huge that there's a sort of disconnect, what with the size differential between monster and man rendering man insignificant and ant-tiny. But this creature is only several sizes larger than a person, and so somehow there's more punch to its attacks and we get unobstructed views of various victims getting, well, pretty effed up. The creature, when it does get screen time, gallumps prodigiously, lending a convincing weight and presence. There's a fluid grace and ease in how it navigates the various bridge undercarriages. There's a sleek dexterity in how it scales walls. Me, I'm rendered pretty darn impressed. So, a well done to the CG work.<br /><br />THE HOST sows a lot of seeds: it subverts the monster horror genre and remains mostly unpredictable. Every so often it'll unleash moments of wicked slapstick humor and, later on, sober us up with scenes of poignancy. Oh, yes, it also calls out the U.S. military (Agent Yellow? I could see it). The scenes with the monster are spectacular. When watching THE HOST, prep yourself to be unsettled but then perhaps invigorated. You may even end up feeling sad. Be that as it may, THE HOST earns five formaldehyde-polluted stars from me.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>You throw enough things in a river and, eventually, something might crawl out of said body of water and have something to say about your methods. Everything from a three-eyed fish in The Simpsons introductions to a lovely little superstar named Godzilla taught me that as a kid, and the somewhat different style of The Host helped to reinforce that in a way that safety videos never do. Add in a family that doesn't quite get along, a government that doesn't really know what to make of something thrashing around in their rivers, men in bright colors, enough bones to make a fantastic roadkill mixed-media sculpture, and slap on a coat of comedy and you have a pretty little playpen that translates to The Host.<br /><br />While many people don't like to see The Host compared to Godzilla films, it really does have the feel of the late 90s Godzilla with a better budget, a REALLY nice monster, and something that might be pieced together better than some of those movies. The family REALLY evoked the comparisons, especially in the case of the son and the things that happen to him, and the point to the movie was similar to the core of the Godzilla theme. There were a lot more components than the monster in this as well, and the way they to fit into the fold actually surprised me because those things seemed like they would be secondary when I saw the previews and not such good primary focuses.<br /><br />If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that the monster made its guest appearance really suddenly, managed to get me really excited as it did what it did for about twenty minutes or more, and then became a pawn in a game much larger than the beast itself. I guess that was a misgiving of mine while going into the film - still, the way the film was marketed made me think an elderly man with a shotgun and a younger lady with a bow would be throwing down with a beast.<br />That KINDA happened, with a heavy KINDA rolling off my tongue, but not really.<br />In this case, the previews realllly stretch the "what is what."<br /><br />When you see this movie, keep that in mind and don't go into it with the expectation of a monstercentric core. Don't get overly excited when you see the monster, either, and remember that this is Korean Cinema and that it follows some of the same formulas - and flaws - that Korean films normally follow. Korean film reminds me of Hong Kong film a few years ago, when it was still finding strong legs to walk on, in the respect that they are a bit choppy sometimes but that they still haven't found a specific flow. That's good, too, because you don't want a centralized theme in all your movies you want things like The Host to be made. Also bear in mind that it IS also like a Godzilla film in the aspects mentioned earlier, and that those pieces genius when you have a director that knows how to make something great. Combine this with the monster, the mayhem, and a really nice twist and you have a movie that shouldn't be overlooked because it's slinky, sexy, and good.<br />O, and don't watch the dubbing no matter the temptation. Remember the sagely advice of mothers around the world; doing that'll make you go blind!!</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>In January of 2005, an American civilian employee at the mortuary of a U.S. military base in Seoul, South Korea, was sentenced to a six-month prison sentence for ordering subordinates to dump 227 liters of contaminated formaldehyde into a sewage drain, that flowed directly the Han River, the prime source of drinking water for the city's twelve million inhabitants. While the US military insisted there was no threat to public health, environmentalists worried that the toxic chemical would be deadly to marine life and could lead to increased incidences of cancer among humans. The case generated a great deal of local outrage including anti-American protests calling for the withdrawal of American troops.<br /><br />Bong Joon-ho's critically acclaimed international hit film "The Host" begins by recreating this scene almost word for word based on news reports. While the monstrous consequences he draws from this event are straight out of the pages of comic books and science fiction films, this film is really about the true victims of such environmental carelessness: the locals, who live close to the river, and who are powerless to protect themselves and their families in the face of nameless threats they are exposed to as a result of the carelessness, shortsightedness, ineptitude and even deception of the government, military, and industry.<br /><br />The film works on a number of levels, both as a family comedy and drama, a really scary freakout film and a conspiracy thriller, a showcase for ingenious use of animation, and even, I think, a serious meditation on the nature of families and especially on the role of fatherhood, but I want to focus briefly on the fact it belongs to a venerable (well, that's not exactly the right word), .... a fairly long and choppy tradition of "toxic monster" movies whose most iconic exemplar is Godzilla. The basic premise of such films is that a monster is created or awoken by human carelessness or greed manifested in the form of toxic dumping, nuclear testing, and other arrogant forms of intervention into the course of nature - and this monster goes on to terrorize the locals. The implication is, of course, that the monster is us: that human beings bring upon themselves their own destruction.<br /><br />Early in the film, in response to dubious military claims regarding a new and unseen threat that compounds the danger that had emerged from the toxic depths of the Han River, the elderly Hie-bong shrugs and states that "if the government says so, we have to accept it." In the end, and after an intelligently plotted and very funny and thrilling ride, it is this complacent and passive attitude that is most challenged by this film. The filmmakers suggest that such people (i.e. all of us) are at bottom mostly concerned not about big issues but about our families, our friends, and our way of life. "The Host" is a hopeful and deeply humanistic film in its portrayal of a few people who out of love are willing to face up to environmental terrors they did not have a hand in creating. Even where we do not care for or have the capacity to understand the issues related to the "environment" in the abstract, this film suggests, it is enough that we care about each other and about the places we call home, and if enough of us care enough to refuse to be complacent with the voices telling us there is nothing to be done, we can individually and collectively make some kind of difference.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>SPOILER<br /><br />An art-house re-make of Godzilla was always going to have long odds on working. HOST seems interminable and its stop/start rhythm irritates and bores quickly. When it eventually lumbers to a climax, instead of getting our pulses racing, the director decides to go for a molasses-slow elegiac sequence presumably critiquing industrial society and man's alienated place in it. One family tragedy was enough, I would of thought, and this second nose-dive into the maudlin is writing a cheque the audience just can't cash.<br /><br />Appropriately, this is a stinker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>I'm sure there are many fans of the Japanese film art that will disagree with me, but this film made little sense.  It skipped from here to there with little connection between scenes.  It was hard to follow and dubbed poorly.  The only positive note to it was that the monster was done with some very decent FX, looking like a carp with legs or some kind of mudskipper gone wrong.<br /><br />The film starts with the dumping of some very old formaldehyde down the drain and into the river.  What happens from this is our large and unfriendly mutated carp monster.  One sunny day, the monster jumps out of the river and wreaks havoc on the people enjoying a day by the water.  Some he eats and some he takes back to his "den" for later consumption.  Among those taken to the den is a young girl whose family won't give up on her.  (although there is a hilarious mourning scene where they all thrash around on the floor in front of her picture tacked up among the dead from the grisly attack)<br /><br />There's also a virus associated with the monster, and the government starts to spray people and takes one member of the girl's family into isolation to attempt to figure out the virus, since he seems to have no effect from it.  Meanwhile, the creature roams the sewers, and renegade bands descend into the sewers in an attempt to catch it, including the little girls aunt with her bow and arrow (she's recently been in an archery contest where she froze up at the critical moment).<br /><br />Though the monster is good, the movie makes little sense and there's a lot of scenes that "stretch" out a little too long.  I watched the movie with six other people and none of us could quite figure out what was going on.  It's an entirely different mindset from American movies.  It's a movie that will have to be watched more than once to figure it all out, if you have the inclination to watch it again.  I don't.  I just didn't think it was good enough for a second viewing.  My advice is to rent, not buy, and if you are really into Japanese films you will most likely love this movie more than I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>I cannot believe that reviewers have actually given this piece of junk more than one star.  It was horrible.  The "MONSTER" looked like a plastic toy.  The "PLOT" was pretty simple and plodding (as well as predictable).  I guess I could take one of my rubber toys, magnify it a couple of times and make a movie myself to much acclaim.<br /><br />By the way, why was this piece of junk called "The Host"?  Why wasn't it just called "The Fish" or something that made sense. What really got me was that a review on the cover of the DVD compared it favorably to Jaws. What a lie!!  Thank goodness that I borrowed it for free from my local library - if I had paid a penny, it would have been war.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>The Host is not the best monster movie ever made. It offers good times, but it really is a mixed bag film. Unfortunately I'd have to disagree with some of the critical acclaim on the box because this film is not at par with Jaws, and it certainly isn't scary. It is worth a look, but don't expect the greatest monster movie you'll ever see.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story begins in a morgue where two morticians are getting rid of dangerous chemicals by pouring them down the sink, where the contents went into the Han River. It takes the B-movie approach by having a dangerous creature morph into an abomination because of these chemicals. Then one day onlookers stare at a strange creature that is holding onto the bridge. It then jumps into the river, swims to shore, and then begins attacking people on the shore and eating them. When a girl gets taken by the monster, her family is determined to find her and kill the creature that the government claims the host of some kind of mysterious virus.<br />MUSIC: The score is excellent and superbly crafted, one of the best parts of the movie.<br />STORY: The story is uneven and riddled with holes and displays an overall sloppy presentation (Not to mention the awful ending). The lowest point of the entire film. Plus, there are some parts you can't take seriously because they are cheesy. This film's comedic humor manages to save some parts of the story but feel out of place.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: It all depends on how much like monster movies, you can like and you can hate it. It all depends on your preferences of films. I found it to be good, but flawed because of the storyline. This film will not scare you.<br />OVERALL: It's good, but flawed because of a sloppy story. But the great music, atmosphere, certain creature scenes, and a few extras keep things moving.<br />THE GOOD: Cool monster, great music, cool scenes, funny humor.<br />THE BAD: Sloppy story, some cheesy scenes, don't ever watch this in the English language; it's painful put on Korean and insert English subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>No, really, this is a drama about a family coming back together.  The monster, who is the title of the film, is the mover of the plot only in that it kidnaps the girl.  The father, and the rest of the family, spend the rest of the film trying to find her and save her.  Even the governments involved focus more on the virus the monster has than the monster itself.  In the end it seems like they're not even worried about killing it.  The cast is great and I plan to try to find more movies based on the stars and the directors.  In fact, I only do have a few.  The extras are fun, very interesting and go on forever!  Love the humor and the behind the scenes features.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>To be able to make both at the same time is something only a few directors can do. To do that, and still be able to make an emotionally sad movie is not something I have seen before. After watching this I thought it was a good genre-blending movie. Director Joon-ho Bong <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XRZQK">Memories of Murder</a>-(great film by the way) goes for a very character centric feel, using the Park family as the nucleus of the movie and not as you would expect the creature itself. In many ways the Host is more a natural disaster movie than a creature feature at times. Though like Godzilla, the creature is the result of man's disregard for the environment, that is really where a lot of the comparisons end. With this film being quite different from Toho's legendary suitmation icon's outings, which where all about the big G himself and humans merely incidental. Though you might be able to compare this a little more to the American Godzilla remake, if only to see how a CGI monster movie should be done and to remind yourself just how lame Roland Emmerich's movie really was. How ever when the creature does turn up in Bongs movie it does have a really good impact with several instances making me jump a bit, after being lulled into a false sense of security by the stretches of monster free screen time.<br /><br />The initial appearance of the creature under the bridge and the chaos that ensues is some of the best creature action put on film in a long, long time. The creature is well designed and for the most part the CGI is very good. The way it moves is great and very original. I think they might have gone a bit overboard on the mouth design as this is a mutant of some kind and not an alien, but really that's being picky about a great design. Personally I would have liked just a bit more creature action in the rest of the film, I appreciate the director's idea to give it a sense of the dramatic and the real, but I didn't care that much about some of the character interplay and subplots. That said all the cast where pretty good in their roles with Kang-ho Song holding his own well in the starring role and Hie-bong Byeon excellent as his father. Newcomer Ah-sung Ko as the young Hyun-seo does an amazing job in her scenes around the creature considering its all CGI. She has some really convincing facial expressions and manages to give a really natural performance a million miles removed from that horrible precious trained acting kid stuff we put up with from many western movies.<br /><br />"The Host" for the most part manages to be pretty successful at avoiding being as one dimensional as it so easily could have been (though that's not such a bad thing with creature features). Bong manages to balance comedy, terror, sadness and action well and create a believable human tale in amongst the unbelievable nature of the films theme. The film has a slightly, I won't say anti American, because that's not true, its more a slightly condemning look at the America's environmental polices or lack of them. One thing the story does present well is the way authorities so concerned with the big picture, will often ignore the individual. In this case leaving Kang du with only his family to turn to and the way the seemingly dysfunctional family without question band together to save Hyun-seo is great. The films finish is not anywhere near as strong as its start and though still good is a bit weak in my opinion, although it does manage to surprise in some ways. I'm sure this flick will be remade by Hollywood soon, though they may slightly alter the premise. "The Host" is the best creature feature in some time and its feeling of reality should appeal to a much wider audience than just fans of horror and sci-fi.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There are some things about this movie that I loved.  The cinematography is amazing, especially those crystal clear close ups that feel so glossed yet so dirty at the same time.  The score is marvelous, and really finds so much color and texture in so many different moments of the film.  The plot and actual pacing and the way that themes are presented with semi-originality is also a blessing.  But then there are let downs.  The acting as a whole is over the top, and not in a good way.  The film also suffers from lack of true focus in the thematic elements, getting serious then campy then serious and failing to blend the two in a way that feels complete.  I also found the graphics to be somewhat cheap and on the verge of `Sci-Fi Network' feeling, until the end where they miraculously felt more grounded and lived in.  That said, for what it promises to be (a monster movie), `The Host' delivers for the most part.  It is fun and it has so many rich elements at play here.  I wish it had been better, and it is nowhere near the creative splendor of some films it is attempting to compare itself to (seriously, `Jaws'...like, you're kidding right?) but it does offer something.  I enjoyed this and I'd recommend it to friends of mine who are into this genre.  In fact, MKIA, you should check this out since it does pay homage to the dated monster movies of old that you are in love with.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>The Host<br /><br />Not really sure what to expect, and seeing mixed reviews made me hesitant, but director Bong Jooh-Ho put together quite the monster movie show.<br /><br />The American stereotype and environmental message hits you with a sledgehammer right out the gate.  A doctor decides to ignore rules and protocol and orders a South Korean assistant to dump gallons of formaldehyde and other noxious chemicals down the drain, after all the river Han is "wide."<br /><br />The monster, kinda like a galloping tadpole, except it's huge, starts out eating beer cans and then raises his diet to South Koreans.<br /><br />We also meet the family that gets most involved, which is what the story is really all about.  The central focus on a different group, like in Cloverfield, is different than your usual "slow reveal" of the monster.<br /><br />Like in Cloverfield, the military and the medical communities are running things, despite protests and where the cure is worse than the disease.  Reflective of the SARS epidemic, the governmental cover-ups and both American and Korean screw-ups are clearly evident.<br /><br />The whole dad-son connection and their search for their child was heartbreaking and I was disappointed that the end didn't give us more hope.  The doctor and medical scenes were frightening - but how did the son survive a drill bit to the skull?<br /><br />He breaks out into the middle of a barbeque!  Funny stuff.<br /><br />And how the monster gets killed by a few ragtag citizens rather than the Korean army (which seemed more interested in martial law than getting the monster) was interesting and unfortunately a probable response.<br /><br />Different, groundbreaking, certainly not formulaic.

I probably lost that idea in the many, many comparisons that have been made to Jaws (which make no sense at all to me). All the hyperbole ("one of the greatest monster movies ever made!") aside, however, The Host is an amusing little flick, certainly capable of holding a viewer's attention for a couple of hours.<br /><br />The plot: after a number of toxic chemicals were ordered dumped into the Han River by a neglectful army higher-up (this part of the story, by the way, actually happened, though no giant monsters have yet cropped up), something very large and very hungry started growing in the Han River. One day, it wakes up and decides it's hungry-- and my, don't those folks on the shore look appetizing? So it goes to have itself a meal, and takes a snack for later-- Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Il in her first screen role). Her father, Gang-du (Lady Vengenace's Kang-ho Song), pursues the monster to no avail. Later, at the memorial service for the monster's victims, Gang-Du, his siblings Nam-joo (Linda Linda Linda's Du-na Bae, who's rapidly becoming Korea's It Girl) and Nam-il (Hae-il Park, recently of Memories of Murder), and his father Hie-bong (The Scent of Chrysanthemums' Hie-bong Byeon), into custody... after which they get a frantic call from Hyun-seo, who's still alive and hiding in the creature's lair. The family must escape custody and find Hyun-seo, helped and hindered by any number of odd characters. And, of course, the monster itself.<br /><br />Forget Juno-- The Host is the little movie that could. Nominated for seven Grand Bells (the Korean Oscars, essentially) including Best Film, it won two (Best Director and Best Editing), and estimates say that almost 20% of South Korea's entire population went to see the movie in theaters. Once it got out, it went on a festival rampage, taking awards at the Saturns, the Asia-Pacific Film Festival, the Asian Awards, and Fantasporto, among others. Needless to say, it also shattered South Korean box office records, taking in over ten billion (yes, with a B) won during its theatrical run. (To put it in perspective, that's about ten and a half million bucks... on six hundred seventeen screens.) But you have to ask yourself, given that the unbearably awful Titanic is still the top-grossing movie in American history, whether it's any good.<br /><br />And it is. The script is sharp, the acting is dynamic (and very tight; many of these performers have worked together on multiple movies in the past), the creature effects are some of the best I've seen in recent years. It's not a great film, by any means; it's a simple, straightforward monster movie that's got some added depth with the family angle-- but it's a lot of fun, and it's a movie that does stand up very well to rewatching, mostly because it's predictable without being boring and/or stupid. Fun! ***</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>**** 2006. Co-written and directed by Joon-ho Bong. Numerous awards throughout the world. The Korean director already responsible for the masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XRZQK">Memories of Murder</a> rewrites and rethinks the classic Japanese monster movie with an indisputable panache. Mixing comic scenes with dramatic pics, Joon-ho Bong is a future great name of the Asian cinema. A DVD for your library. Now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The obvious frame of reference is to say that "Gwoemul" ("The Host") is in the grand tradition of Japanese monster movies such as the original "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA4TLQ">Gojira</a>" from 1954.  But while the monster is indeed a mutant it is not in a rubber suit, this 2006 film comes from South Korea rather than Japan, and the climax does not involve a showdown between the monster and the army.  That being said, director Bong Joon-ho ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XRZQK">Memories of Murder</a>") has put together the best good old fashioned monster movie that I have seen in a long time, and one that is certainly going to erase the bad memories we have of the lamentable remake of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767817478">Godzilla</a>."  The result is not perfect, but this one certainly has its moments.<br /><br />Supposedly because his bottles are dusty, the pathologist at a U.S. military base makes his assistant toss cases of formaldehyde down the drain and into the Han River.  A short while latter a monstrous creature emerges in broad daylight and starts scattering spectators right and left.  Our unlikely hero is Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a Seoul snack vendor with a tendency towards narcolepsy, who likes with his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung), and his father, Hie-bong (Byeon Hie-bong).  When the monster starts attacking Gang-du and an off-duty American serviceman (David Joseph Anselmo) try to do something about it, without much success.  Then Hyun-seo walks out of the shop and into the madness and in a harrowing scene her father is unable to save her.  Mourning the loss of Hyun-seo are not only her father and grandfather, but Gang-du's brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il), an alcoholic, and his sister Nam-joo (Bae Du-na), an archery medallist.  But then two things happen: the family is quarantined by the government, who are worried that the monster has contaminated people who come into contact with it, and Gang-du gets a cell phone call from Hyun-seo, who says she is somewhere in the Seoul sewar system, apparently being kept as a snack for the beastie.<br /><br />It seems strange to say that "The Host" will remind you as much of "Little Miss Sunshine" as it will "Godzilla," but when you have a dysfunctional family in a van trying to band together for the sake of a young girl the comparison strikes me as inevitable.  The obvious thing to complain about here is the length because you have to think that less would be more with this film running 1:59, but it seems that in South Korea audiences expect their movies to run two hours long and that is what this one does (it is the biggest blockbuster in South Korean movie history).  But on the plus side the computer generated monster is pretty impressive, and that is half the battle in a monster movie like this one.  Still, regardless of length there is something of disconnect between the set up and the pay off in this film, which, despite the predictability what with an archer running around an all, will surprise you.  This is a film that wants to work comedy in the mix, and while it often works in the end I am not sure if it was appropriate.  However, all things considered "The Host" is definitely worth seeing for fans of monster movies and may well become a personal favorite in that particular genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>First of all, pouring countless bottles of formaldehyde down a sink drain is a bad idea. Especially when that drain runs into Seoul's Han River. And especially when said formaldehyde mixes with an existing creature in the river and mutates into a giant blood-thirsty crocodile-squid-alien that immediately begins to ravage the city. A young scientist learns this lesson within the first ten minutes of the pulse-pounding horror-comedy The Host.<br /><br />Unwilling to stick to the typical monster movie layout, The Host is two hours of almost constant, frenetic action sequences following the quest of one family to reclaim their youngest member from the mutant beast's lair deep in the sewer. After a brutal attack on a lakeside park, the government and U.S. armed forces descend on the city and quarantine everyone who was near the location, claiming that the creature is a host of a terrible virus that must be contained. But with young Hyun-seo still alive and trapped in the monster's hiding place, one family can't let government policy stand in their way, as they set out to find and free the young girl.<br /><br />The Host is an intriguing mix of strange comedy and frightfully scary horror sequences. With more shots of the creature than any similar movie to date, The Host gives audiences what they came to see: an expertly crafted and showcased horror monster running amok on the shore and then diving back into its home in the water. The gaping maw filled with razor-sharp teeth is reminiscent of Alien, while its size and swimming ability are like bringing Jaws onto the land.<br /><br />Sometimes the story gets a little confusing, but Eastern films have a tendency to do that to our Western minds, especially horror films that are based around scaring you silly rather than maintaining a solid through-line. Made in Korea, The Host manages better than Japanese films such as Ju-On and Ringu to follow a legitimate story through to its thrilling end. It's difficult to classify The Host as just one type of movie, considering it has sequences of action, adventure, horror, comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi, and the good old fashioned thriller mixed together into its own new breed of film (perhaps there's some formaldehyde thrown in there for good measure).<br /><br />Horror fans will find that there's more than enough to keep them interested and constantly impressed, while movie-goers who appreciate solid acting will also be able to enjoy the film. Overall, The Host is a solid recreation and rebirth of the creature-feature for the 21st century. With a bigger monster, more realistic story, and intense and lingering shots of the ferocious beast, The Host is sure to be an instant horror classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Reportedly the biggest box office hit in South Korean movie history, "The Host" is a fun monster-movie parody that is also a touching family drama and an indictment of the evils of modern science at one and the same time.<br /><br />The trouble begins when a U.S. Army mortician orders his reluctant lab assistant to pour mass quantities of spoiled formaldehyde down the drain directly into Seoul's Han River.  In no time flat, the toxic waste has mutated into a massive sea creature that can live both on land and in water and which devours any hapless human unfortunate enough to wander onto its path.  It also captures certain individuals and drags them to a sewer where he keeps them for later feeding.  One such victim is a young girl named Hyun-seo, whose family members - a kindly grandfather, an aunt and an uncle, and her own childlike father - after receiving no assistance from the governmental authorities, are forced to make a desperate attempt on their own to rescue her.<br /><br />Directed by "Memories of Murder"'s Bong Joon-ho, "The Host" is not a laugh-a-minute parody in the scattershot mold of the "Airplane," "Naked Gun," "Scary Movie" franchises.  Instead, it mocks the conventions of its genre while at the same time treating those conventions with seriousness and respect.  The characters may act in ways that are silly and goofy, but the threat posed by the creature is always real, so that we laugh at the same time we are awaiting the next suspense-filled jolt to come our way.<br /><br />The movie, in many ways, is really more about the dynamics of this one family than it is about a city coping with a man-eating monster.  Of particular interest is Hyun-seo's father, Gang-du, a kindhearted man who lives with his dad, sleeps most of the day at the store they run, and seems never to have fully grown into adulthood.  His idea of good parenting skills is playing video games with his daughter while handing her a freshly opened can of beer.  This puts him in direct conflict with his younger brother and sister, who continually berate Gang-du for being an irresponsible parent.  It is only in the midst of an intense crisis such as the one the family is facing that Gang-du finds the fortitude, courage and maturity he needs to be a true father to his daughter.<br /><br />As in most films of this nature, the scientists and governmental authorities in "The Host" are viewed with suspicion, if not downright hostility.  They spend most of their time lying to the general public in an attempt to hide their own inadequacies and incompetence.  The Americans come in for a particular black eye in this film, which prompts one to wonder just how favorably the United States government is viewed by the people (or at least the filmmakers) of South Korea.<br /><br />The performances are good, though "The Host" might have been a better film with a few minutes shaved off its running time. As it is, it runs a little long for a movie of this type, with most of the best laughs occurring in the front portion of the film.  It also has a tendency to take itself just a bit too seriously in its final half hour, blunting its satiric edge somewhat as a consequence.<br /><br />Still, this is a clever, entertaining film with cool special effects and an appealingly self-mocking tone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>When you watch the film like the Host, you're kind of reminded of just how fresh it seems even if the plot isn't exactly brand new. Sure the idea of a mutated creature running rampant has been done before (The Relic, Mimic), the political messages and a more family-oriented tone rather than just out-and-out carnage but somehow the film successfully brings all of these together with a film that, yes, while being not completely original and it does have a few minor flaws, it still manages to entertain.<br /><br />Park Gang-Hu is a concession stand worker living near the Han River. There with his dad Hie-Bong and daughter Hyun-Seo, he gets quite the surprise one day when a mutated creature from the river arrives and rampages through the park, eating and kidnapping some of the people including Hyun-Seo. But misinformation and an overbearing government declares the creature biologically contagious and can infect others, including Gang-Hu, Hie-Bong, university student and Hyun-Seo's uncle Nam-Il and her auntie, archer Nam-Joo. They 4 of them have to try and escape the authorities and save Hyun-Seo who's being kept alive by the creature for a future meal.<br /><br />The film starts out with an incredibly memorable attack as the creature first makes its appearance. And like one reviewer said, you're sort of taken aback by just how quick it's seen onscreen. None of that Jaws or Alien stuff where it takes so long to see the creature, it just shows it in full-view dropping into the river then as its running towards camera. Also I find the creature to be well-animated and doesn't look like a hideous blob like the crocodile in Primeval. One complaint is that it does look a bit too texture-y and very noticeable but as a whole, the creature is well done.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film after the attack, it's also just as good although some might feel it doesn't have that pull the opening did. You get quite sympathetic for the family and hope that somehow, this odd-yet-functioning family finds the daughter but you almost wish the creature would pop up more since we can go literally 20 minutes without even seeing anything and you kind of wonder where it went and why it's not doing anything. It's fine to slow the pace down and chat but it's not as tension-filled as it should've been. But the tone is quite well done such as the humor that comes in or the handling of the governments and isn't as bothersome as one might think.<br /><br />Whether or not it's on par with Jaws or Alien shouldn't even be an issue since all 3 films succeed on different merits. One's fun, one's scary and this one's kind of a blend of the 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />There's some illegal dumping going on, a little amphibious creature falls into a body of water and swim off, then a few years later on the shores of the Han River in South Korea, some onlookers see a strange creature hanging from a bridge, it drops into the river and soon after comes to the shore. This creature proceeds to wreak havoc, by knocking around the nearby tents and food stands, stomping and knocking people out of the way, killing a few and in this whole melee it takes the daughter of a young man named Park Gang-Doo (Kang-ho Song, "Thirst") and jumps back into the Han River.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie involves Gang-Doo and his extended family trying to find his daughter and kill this creature. There's equal parts comedy, drama and some good scares from the monster attacks on the locals, the dialogue which is mainly subtitled outside of a few american actors is pretty good and witty. The opening monster attack is probably one of the best sequences ever in these type of movies, it stays at a great pace and the creature is fairly unique looking (not an easy thing to do since most everything has been done to death when it comes to monster design).<br /><br />Loved the scenes too with the daughter and another captured boy as they were pretty much how any kid would try to deal with the horror that surrounds them. There's the underlying story in the movie about whether the government is lying about this monster carrying a deadly virus and that it needs to be avoided (cause the first thing any rational person would do is approach a deadly creature like that, right?).<br /><br />What makes "The Host", way, way better than most any monster flick is how layered it is, director Bong Joon-Ho keeps it balanced, the horror appears in good spots, the comedy is good and refreshing and the acting actually is pretty good, with most of the actors appearing quite believable. I highly recommend "The Host" to anyone that enjoys monster films, you just have to be prepared to read (if you watch the subtitled version that is, which is the best way in my opinion).<br /><br />The extras include: Deleted scenes, commentary from Bong Joon-Ho, making of "The Host", special effects featurette, cast interviews, a gag reel and much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I've been eyeing "The Host" for years, having heard it was the inspiration for several other "kaiju"-style monster films since, most notably "Cloverfield," but it took me years before I was finally able to make the comparison myself.  Although the two have some similarities - undersea creature mutated by modern living returns to ravage modern civilization - you could say the same thing about Godzilla. Fortunately "The Host" stands quite well on its own.<br /><br />It all begins with an urban myth.  An American military pathologist (Scott Wilson) supposedly dumped 480 bottles of dusty formaldehyde down the drain into the Han River. The facts behind this case have been monstrously distorted, just like the twisted beast in "The Host," but that doesn't stop the movie from telling a great tale.  The film implies that "the host" country (South Korea) is being taken advantage of the United States.<br /><br />But "The Host" is as much a film about (Korean) family values as it is about monsters.  The family in question is led by patriarch Hee-Bong (Byeon Hee-bong), his three children: national medalist archer Nam-joo (Bae Doona), former activist Nami-il (Park Hae-il), dim-witted snack-bar assistant Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho); and Park's daughter and Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-seong).<br /><br />To American audiences Park, who is comically narcoleptic, appears as a washed-up man-child dependent on his father's income.  But Park is also a member of a tightly meshed family unit and therefore the closest to his father despite his economic woes.  When Hyun-seo is kidnapped by the creature as a future meal, they band together to do what the government won't.<br /><br />Making matters worse is the suspicion that the beast is infectious and therefore Park, who came into contact with the creature, is a vector (another "host"), evoking SARS, avian flu, and "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms." Intercut between government suppression and the family's grief are scenes of suspicion among the civilian populace.  Masks are worn.  People who appear sick are shunned. And the media feasts on their fear.<br /><br />American audiences are likely to be turned off by the broad caricatures of incompetence and grief.  Park in particular is difficult to like. THE SPOILER: This is the kind of movie where a horrific lobotomy scene is played for laughs.<br /><br />Director Bong Joon-ho is familiar with all the typical movie tropes and tweaks them.  He introduces several Chekov Guns - Will Nam-joo finally make a critical bow shot after freezing up at the Olympics?  Will Nami-il use his guerilla tactics for good?  Will Park save the last bullet for the monster? - and then promptly teases the audience by having each character utterly fail, at first, to do what we expect.<br /><br />Like the other tropes that are averted in "The Host," the creature is hidden for a few minutes and then come barreling onto screen, in full daylight, amidst a crowd. This fact becomes a sore point with the military--the creature does nothing to hide and yet the government can't, or won't, find it.  The beast itself is a water pollution nightmare, part-tadpole, part-deep sea fish.  Milky white orbs serve as eyes, vestigial limbs jut at odd angles, and the monster lopes painfully on the land.  It is the sum of all our fears: our civilized world is so corrupt that even something as natural as sharing a drink at a watering hole has been violated.<br /><br />"The Host" has its flaws, but like the titular monster, it is far more powerful as a symbol of our worst fears than as a mere monster movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Since the days of King Kong and Gozilla, audiences worldwide have enjoyed watching millions be terrorised on the big screen by giant monsters. In Joon-ho Bong's The Host we have a similar scenario with an unusual monster terrorising locals along the Han River. This quickly became South Korea's most successful box-office hit, promising not just horror but a slice of drama with a rich topping of comedy, but how does it fare as a whole?<br /><br />The film begins with an American doctor informing his concerned Korean assistant to pour hundreds of bottles of formaldehyde down the sink which eventually drains into the Han River. Two fishermen later find a small but very strange creature in the water which they release without a second thought. Moving to the present we witness a man commit suicide by jumping off a bridge into the Han River but not before spotting something dark in the water. Curious locals soon spot something unusual hanging from the bridge and when it jumps into the river and comes towards them the city is soon being terrorised. Although the creature kills hundreds and leads to the army and emergency services being sent in to deal with it, the primary focus of The Host is on one family. Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) runs a riverside shack with his father Hee-bong (Byeon Hee-bong) and the family is left devastated when Gang-du's daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-seong) is seemingly killed by the creature. When she later contacts her father, Gang-du gathers his father and siblings in defying the authorities and leading a perilous mission to rescue Hyun-seo.<br /><br />That may have sounded quite serious until the latter stages and in many respects this is how The Host works. The creature is your typical, everyday monster, moving fast, devouring people, having a long tongue and growling a lot. Everyone seems helpless as it continues to terrorise the city though Gang-du and an American tourist do their best by hurling whatever they can get their hands on at it! When the American is wounded and later dies it leads to the US insisting they send their own forces to deal with the crisis as the South Korean government clearly has no idea what it's doing. These developments are merely in the background as we live through this disaster with Gang-du and his family. In the aftermath of the creature's first attack the family are reunited at a shelter for survivors and we get an amusing insight into their characters. While Gang-du suffers from chronic bouts of sleepiness, he is still a devoted but flawed father to Hyun-seo. Hee-bong tolerates his son's laziness and defends him against his other two children, both who also have their negative characteristics. Nam-joo (Bae Doona) is an archer that competed at the Olympics but is let down by her hesitation and slow reactions, evident in a brilliant moment when the family make a desperate getaway in a van and Nam-joo is almost left behind as she reacts too slowly and has to be dragged into the van by her brother! Finally there is Nam-il (Park Hae-il) who is a former activist and graduate who has done little with his life and laments the sorry state of South Korea. This seemingly inept family are our heroes for the duration and we are left to rely on them to take down the monster, something they seem far from capable of!<br /><br />The Host combines humour and drama very well. When Gang-du and his family are first reunited there is much arguing, pushing and shoving, before a group hug and later more pushing which leads to the quartet falling over in a heap. After being detained by the authorities, Gang-du is contacted by his daughter and his family band together to rescue her. Hee-bong ends up using most of his savings to orchestrate the family's escape and to obtain some weapons from what looked like members of the criminal underworld, but these are desperate times so it's perfectly understandable! While Gang-du and his family continue their search the film often switches to Hyun-seo who is trapped in the sewers close to the Han River where the creature brings victim after victim to be left for a grand feast later. Hyun-seo has to pretend to be dead whenever the creature pops back to its lair but all the time she is trying to find a way to escape.<br /><br />The Host isn't to be taken seriously and it's a lot of fun especially in the grand finale. Gang-du goes into battle with the creature armed with a street sign, Nam-il takes up some Molotov cocktails while Nam-joo is armed with her bow but so slow and hesitant is she that the creature often has time to push her out of the way. You won't know whether to be worried or just amused. Despite the laughs The Host has a surprisingly sad ending which I didn't see coming. There are no fanciful ways of defeating the creature in the end either, no cheap tricks just sheer determination from Gang-du and his family.<br /><br />As a monster film The Host ticks many of the right boxes for entertainment. This is not a perfect film, it's downright silly in places, and is unlikely to frighten you either given one of its tags as a horror film. However, if you have a sense of humour this is certainly worth considering.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>well I haven't received my Blu-ray i just ordered but since i have Mac i watched the instant video included with the purchase which was a nice feature, wish i could have downloaded somehow to my Mac. Anyway, the movie starts off great, but then by the time you get midway though, it gets way too overly clever and starts to use redundant plot characterizations over and over again. So in the end the beginning is great, then doesn't give a pay off until the end which is a novel twist at best for the sake of some sobering "realism" within the giant monster genre.<br /><br />I just ordered and watched a ton of Godzilla, Gamera movies prior to this, and they are stupid, yet typically much more enjoyable than this movie since your suspension of disbelief is non existent regarding those types of fun movies. The problem i found with this movie was that it TRIED to be more serious and most of the character actions were plain stupid. If you know you're dealing with this type of creature why act so stupid? And they showed almost next to no action taken by the military or local police in trying to strategize and capture, analyze of kill the creature at all.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, i'd suggest renting it or watching at a friends house before buying to own it. I was really excited to check it out but it comes up far short of what i was anticipating overall. Perhaps in time i'll find this fits a certain mood and i'll enjoy it more? doubt it, i'll just pop in King Kong Escapes and have a real good time laughing instead.<br /><br />Update: this movie grows on you, it's more moody and less predictable than most giant monster films... basically it's a more artistic approach to the genre. I'll add an extra star making it a 4 star rating for myself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>The pollution in the Han River gives birth to Korea's greatest terror: a giant amphibian monster that is the host to a deadly disease! When the monster strikes the Wonhyogyo riverbank and captures a young girl, it is up to her family to band together and come to her rescue. While it appears to be a monster movie on the surface, THE HOST is a touching family drama at heart that is filled with plenty of fun characters and light humor. The Park family is by no means perfect, but they must each put their differences aside in order to save their courageous daughter Hyun-Seo. Director Bong Joon-Ho takes a far different approach to the monster movie and opens with an incredible attack sequence that is beautifully shot and choreographed, revealing the monster to the audience very early on. From here, the beast becomes a background player that is simply a catalyst for the family's struggle. Also unlike most traditional Japanese monster movies, the slimy creature is rendered entirely by computer, but its sleek design and interactions with the surrounding environments give it a life of its own. Bong infuses the plot with a strong sense of satire and biting social commentary as well, but in a way that is both relevant and entertaining at the same time. THE HOST is one of the stronger Korean exports in recent years, and a worthy addition to the giant monster genre!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>The Host is an unlikely horror film that combines various elements that are generally not found in a horror film, love for the family, environment, critique on governmental policy, American military presence in South Korea, dark humor. All these elements were successfully incorporated in the film and that was what made it interesting to me.<br />The buildup is slow but then you have the finest destruction scene in recent years. I gave this scene a high mark because the monster does not get to topple any famous landmarks instead it rushes after people and you get to observe the emotions which are a combination of fear and helplessness on their faces in this chaos.  The news breaks to the media and the military is called to help provide medical care and then quarantine the citizens. You have the introduction to the characters who will be protagonists, a child like adult (Song Kang Ho ) his sister who is a archer, and brother who is educated but unemployed. This family gets together and goes in search of the monster.<br />One may think that this is a monster movie but in reality this movie is about family and turning to their help when everything else has failed.  The action scenes and the story line riveting. I liked this movie 3 stars 6/13/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>They sure don't waste any time getting to it in this one! The recipe for a monster is presented right away followed by immediate mayhem. The rollercoaster ride basically is peak-dip-peak, yet the dip has a few jolting bumps in it as well. Overall the film is enjoyable.<br /><br />So many funny moments, from the family reunion to the cross-eyed doctor! The bronze medalist daughter is cool, too. A great varietal mix overall.<br /><br />The monster is flat-out awesome...very acrobatic, too.<br /><br />As for the disc, the menu screen is a bit cheesy, but nothing that should influence a purchase either way. However, during the feature you'll probably notice a lockup [on the copy I rented as well as those of many whose reviews I've read] both as the authorities place a sack over Park Gang-du's head, as well as after the screen fades out from the final action sequence (there's still alittle bit of movie left after that point). I was able to fiddle around with rewinding it and fast forwarding it to just after the lockup and got things moving again, but how lame it is to have to do that.<br /><br />I don't really recommend "buying" this disc to own, but I do feel it is a must see - either rent it or if you can handle the quirks go ahead and buy it...it is a cool movie. In the stores, I've discovered two HD DVD versions: product number 10100 (this one has a blu-ray logo in the misprinted label on back) and number 10101 (with proper HD DVD labeling). I do not know if the mastering errors have been removed on 10101, but if you're going to buy this disc I would recommend making sure it's the later print.</p></br></body></html>

This rat can cook right along with the best of them. He learned his culinary talents from reading Chef Gusteau's cookbook. Then, after a sudden and unexpected relocation, he finds that his dream has come true and he is cooking in Gusteau's restaurant in Paris! His family has trouble accepting that he is a chef and the other chefs in the restaurant have some difficulty with it too, but seeing is believing. Ratatouille is a culinary delight for all.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I laughed until I thought I'd choke!!! This is one incredibly fun movie. You simply have to see it.<br /><br />Remy can cook. In fact, he's a real gourmet chef. Only one problem: he's a rat. Linguini, on the other hand, cannot cook. In fact, he's probably one of the clumsiest and most incompetent people you've ever seen. But he's a human, and a chef in a fine Paris restaurant has to be human, right? So Remy hides under Linguini's toque (Is that the word? His chef's hat.) and pulls his hair one way or another to direct Linguini's movements.<br /><br />The result is a fine adventure, a lot of unexpected plot twists, some incredible chase scenes, and a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I was afraid they had given too much away; there would be no surprises. Boy, was I ever wrong! Remy is not only a great cook, he's completely adorable and a bit of a philosopher. There's one scene where his father tries to convince him that life is basically a war between the humans and the rats, and says "that's just the way it is, you can't change it." Remy disagrees. "Dad, life IS change!" he exclaims. So as he turns to go, and his father asks him where he is going, he says, "Hopefully, forward." And he is.<br /><br />I will probably play this movie until I've essentially memorized it. I truly love it. Five stars, no question.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>I remember first watching this on the plane and I was blown away by it and so the moment it was released in Bluray I decided I had to get it.  I am one of those who dislikes having to pay for both a standard and bluray version when I just want one version and so it is great to get a package like this one where they don't force you to get both.  In fact, it is this reason that stops me from upgrading "Beauty and the Beast" for example among other Disney classics until I can get them on the one Bluray disc alone.  As far as this bluray release goes there is nothing not to like about it.  The picture quality in 1080p is stunning and the sound quality in uncompressed 5.1 surround sound is also excellent.  The bonus feature documentaries are great as well making this a great addition to the Pixar section of your video library.<br /><br />This great tale against discrimination and bigotry and about daring to rise beyond artificially constructed social barriers to achieve your dreams is timeless and makes this bluray watchable over and over again.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Ratatouille (animation, comedy, family)<br />Directed by Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava<br />Starring the voices of Patton Oswalt, Lou Romano, Ian Holm and Janeane Garofalo<br /><br />Disney / Buena Vista | 2007 | 111 min | Rated G | Released Nov 06, 2007<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: LPCM 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 5/5<br /><br />Remy (Oswalt) is a young rat with an enhanced sense of taste and smell. When he saves his dad from eating food laced with poison, he's given a job as food tester for the whole colony. Remy quickly becomes bored with the job and dreams of better things. After seeing a TV cooking show, he decides that he would like to be a chef. Unfortunately, he's almost killed by the TVs owner and the entire colony is discovered and forced to leave her house.<br /><br />Remy is separated from his family and talks to an illustration of Gusteau, the TV chef, because he's alone and there's nobody else to talk to. When he discovers Gusteau's restaurant, he finds that he knows the function of every member of the staff. Remy gets into trouble when entering the kitchen, but he adds ingredients to the soup and the customers love it. He's discovered when trying to leave and Linguini (Romano), the kitchen boy, is told to kill him. But the worried look on Remy's face stops Linguini in his tracks and he realizes that Remy fixed the soup. The two decide to work together.<br /><br />Although Remy can be understood by other rats, that's not the case with humans. Instead, he uses gestures to communicate and is very expressive. His tiny shrugs and nods are easy to understand. Quite by accident, Remy discovers that he can control Linguini by pulling at strands of his hair. The two practice at home and come up with a plan to do the same at the restaurant. He hides under Linguini's hat and continues to prepare food by controlling him.<br /><br />The story is well thought out and quite complex in places for an animated film. The 111-minute running time is necessary to show everything in detail. The streets of Paris look real and it's clear that the Pixar team researched the setting thoroughly.<br /><br />Linguini is trained by Colette (Garofalo) and starts to develop feelings for her, but it's Remy's skill that wins the approval of the restaurant's customers. Linguini is deeply resented by the Head Chef (Holm), who knows that Linguini is Gusteau's son and the restaurant's rightful owner. The problem is, Linguini doesn't know that.<br /><br />The film is full of peril, chase scenes and humor, and has a little action. The characters are well developed and Remy is easy to like. It's challenging to make a rat appear friendly and lovable, but Pixar somehow pulls it off. Remy is always happy and smiling and chooses to walk upright on two feet. I think that was done to make him appear more like a human and less like a rat. He's also very particular about cleanliness and washes his paws before preparing any food.<br /><br />The restaurant eventually captures the attention of food critics and is visited by Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), who is the most famous critic of them all. He's hard to impress and had written off Gusteau's as insignificant years ago, but decides to see why it's become relevant again. One of my favorite scenes happens in the restaurant when Ego takes his first bite of food, but I'll let you discover what happens for yourself.<br /><br />The film has a lot of important messages. It shows us that it's wrong to steal and that family is important. But most of all, it's about following your dreams. Remy is a rat. How can he possibly become a chef? Even if he did, how could he succeed? I imagine that children watching the film could be inspired by Remy's achievements. Maybe a few will grow up wanting to be chefs, and they are rarely out of work.<br /><br />I can't watch the film without thinking about Hans Landa's speech in Inglourious Basterds where he asks Perrier LaPadite what his reaction would be if a rat entered his home. How would that differ if a squirrel were to enter? It's true that humans often have a problem with rats, and many of us actually fear them. It's quite an achievement to invent a rat that we like and root for as he attempts to live out his dream.<br /><br />All of Pixar's movies are worth owning, but Ratatouille just edges out Up as my favorite. If they ever decide to do another sequel, I hope that we get another story about Remy. It's aimed at older audiences more than the likes of Cars and A Bug's Life, but children will still be able to enjoy it.<br /><br />Well done, Pixar.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />Ratatouille looks fantastic on Blu-ray. You can see the individual hairs in Remy's fur and the way it beads when he gets wet. The colors are striking and the sheer amount of detail in background scenes tells you all you need to know. This is a reference quality presentation that's ideal for showing off your home theater.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The lossless LPCM 5.1 track is full of subtle detail and delivers well during all of the louder scenes. Although there's very little traditional action, your system will receive a full workout during chase scenes and when Remy is trying to avoid being captured. The sound has good depth and you'll hear the surrounds highlight quieter effects such as vegetables being chopped or background conversation in the restaurant. Dialogue is crisp and clear throughout and there's really nothing that falls short of perfection.<br /><br />Special Features 3.5/5<br /><br />Lifted (5:02, HD) - One of my favorite short films from Pixar.<br /><br />Your Friend the Rat (11:16, HD) - Remy and Emil talk about the history of rats in an amusing way.<br /><br />Gusteau's Gourmet Game - Control Linguini and help him meet incoming orders.<br /><br />Fine Food and Film (13:54, HD) - Director Brad Bird and chef Thomas Keller talk about some of their ideas for the film.<br /><br />Animation Briefings<br /><br />Documentary Shorts<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (15:06) - Three scenes that were removed before they were finished.<br /><br />Deleted Shots R.I.P.

The Blu-ray presentations are all just about perfect and Ratatouille is no exception. The film has heart and warmth and is a fun place to visit. It doesn't have the constant action of some titles, but the story is gripping throughout. Adults will be pleasantly surprised at the depth of the story, although very small children may lose interest. That would be a shame, because I rank it as Pixar's best, and that's saying a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>For a long time my private mantra was: "Vouloir c'est pouvoir."  For me, this meant: "If you can think it, you can do it."  Ratatouille is a wonderful expression of this idea.  The audacious conceit is about a rural French rat who dreams of going to Paris and becoming a world-renowned chef.<br /><br />For a multitude of reasons, many aficionados of animation and great cinema still consider this the best film of the last decade.  The inspired direction is by Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava.  There are few perfect films; this is one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>I might as well come right out with it:  Any attempts to discount Pixar's absolute mastery of the craft of computer animated features are absolutely futile from this critic from this moment forward.  Until now I've been pretty consistent in giving their ballyhooed works 4-star ratings due to the sheer cleverness of their plots and the attention to detail of their visual prowess (sometimes even tainted in protest by Disney's habit of over-promoting) but 2007's Ratatouille has managed to so thoroughly touch upon every single element of what makes a classic film that it nearly single-handedly atones for every set of Toy Story bed sheets or Finding Nemo lunchboxes bartered the world over.<br /><br />Well I suppose as is customary, I should begin this review with a short synopsis of the story with one caveat: Ratatouille really doesn't lend itself to summation.  I knew this going in when all of the pre-purchase research I did led to the same shaky conclusion: Really, a tale about a cooking rat in France?  Never mind all that! This is to French rat chefs what Wall-E is to your trash compactor or what Monsters Inc is to applying for a job at the electric company.  In other words, Pixar takes a fairly mundane concept and packs it so chock full of charm and personality that we would be captivated just looking at an animated lamp.  Oh wait, they've proven that already but I digress.<br /><br />Ratatouille centers on the tale of Remy, a gray rat gifted with a sense of smell. With aspirations of using his talents to concoct gourmet dishes, he is instead given the most un-romantic task of sniffing out rat poison for his rodent colony.<br /><br />When his family is forced to abandon their home in the walls of a cottage in the French countryside, Remy is separated from his brood and ends up in the sewers of Paris. In hunger and desperation, Remy has a hallucination of his lifelong idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau. Following Gusteau's advice, Remy finds himself at the skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's world famous restaurant.  By fate, destiny or just good fortune, the wheels are in motion to put Remy in a position to showcase his repressed talents.<br /><br />Well if after having read all this, the plot sounds awesome to you, congratulations.  You are already ahead of where I was going in.  I really couldn't imagine a full-length animated feature film (and one at 111-minutes at that) about said topic being terribly intriguing and yet I was pleasantly surprised almost immediately.<br /><br />Like most Pixar pieces the exact source of the charm isn't even easily identified.  There is abundant attention to visual and textural detail on a near frame per frame basis, the voice acting is spot on and the character animations are, well, pure Pixar and yet even still I can't help but profess a certain degree of subtle wit and faultless timing that never allows the viewer to forget this is a high class Disney venture through and through.<br /><br />Pacing is downright spectacular with just enough character building and story-setting to establish the tone of what's to come.  The action wastes little time revealing itself and is remarkably satisfying throughout the multiple incarnations contained within.<br /><br />The scoring is Michael Giacchino, which, suffice to say, is downright spectacular with beautiful soaring compositions and personal mood-setters scattered throughout.<br /><br />In all it's difficult to adequately isolate just what it is that makes Ratatouille so wondrous.  I like to think that, like all of Brad Bird's works, there isn't a single factor that outshines the others so much as it's the culmination of years of lessons learned both in 2D and 3D animation mediums.<br /><br />The script contains the type of polish and fineness that comes only with years of tweaking and rewriting.  Scenes flow with deliberate prose, sequences form with near-poetic resolve, and the grand story arc is seamless in its delivery.<br /><br />About the only thing I can say that even resembles a complaint about this work is the simple reality that of all the Pixar pieces, a strong argument could be made that this one is the most adult-oriented of the lot.  Not that kids won't marvel at the bright colors, cute characters, and general onscreen action, it seems much of the subtleties, humor, pacing and gourmet food integration will certainly be better appreciated by the older set.<br /><br />In all I'm quite proud to finally slap a perfect 5-star rating on a Disney/ Pixar property.  This one finally delivers, for me anyway; the potential hinted upon in every Pixar film prior and since and does so with style, grace and humor.  Director Brad Bird concludes his interview on the disc by saying that he loves the medium of computer animation and that fact's apparent here from beginning to end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>This is a very well made story animation project where a picky rat who learns how to cook is discovered by a Paris restaurant garbage boy who uses the rat to present himself as the blossoming star cook. The startling thing about this project is the fact that the rats in the story are more loveable than the annoying humans. I cant think of one, not one, loveable endearing human in this movie, they are all despicable. Even the upscale food critic is a pompous individual who tries to stand in as a sort of villain figure but later becomes the good guy. Linguini drives me up the wall. His rants of "I'm insane, I'm insane, I'm insane!" only makes me nod my head. The chef is a bumbling idiot miniature monster, and the cook girlfriend is a domineering over eager woman in the field of men. Welcome to reality!<br />Remy is the only character that makes sense, a rebel with a cause. A cause to upgrade the status of rathood with choosing your food, and making it wisely. And he does, he uses his rat sense to make supreme cuisine, as well as his philosophy. His rat friends and family are all in this together, but it takes quite awhile to stir up the sense of togetherness, as most don't always agree with his fortitude. Fine job by Pixar, and just another well made nitch on their menu of animated pleasures.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Ratatouille, the second Pixar movie to be directed by Brad Bird, is some serious gourmet ______.  Allow me to go into reviewing this fine movie without having to resort to a cheesy intro filled with terrible puns related to food (nice cliched intro, eh?).<br /><br />Ratatouille's message is pretty simple, but like other Pixar works, they never turn into a preach-fest (which is something all movies should never do), serving up a mix of humor, some action, and people actually doing interesting things instead of just sitting around and talking.  Few things are more entertaining in the Pixar canon than watching a rat (which is somehow cute, but that's because animals are naturally cuter than humans because they are the ______) cook gourmet soup.  However,<br />Pixar is not often known for elaborate witty humor, as some of the slapstick in this movie is not my type of humor (yeah, my humor includes movies like Pulp Fiction and Dead Alive).  Thankfully, there is not a lot of childish slapstick, and even some of the slapstick scenes are kind of funny. And there is some sharp dialogue thrown in there ("Now shut up and eat your garbage".  "Don't be so modest your a rat for pete's sake" etc)I do however, think the Collete and Linguini relationship was just thrown in there to make the movie seem more intimate, but that is pretty much kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Of course, Pixar also is able to create a cast of characters that makes the entertaining parts actually entertaining, and characters you actually give a damn about.  The rat colony and family, the short, leering antagonist, and a colorful set of kitchen cooks (with one that has done time, no less)  And of course, an animated rat is proved to be likeable.  My favorite character is Anton Ego, the powerful food critic (actually pretty dead on description of critics) whom everyone fears, a leering intimidating man, but ultimately a bit good natured and actually humane (and no, he is NOT evil.  Watch the flashback you idiots).<br /><br />As usual, the animation is top notch.  Thanks to the flawless animation and an imagination, Pixar was able to recreate a fantasty version of Paris, somewhat romanticized, but brilliant nonetheless.  Remy's overhead look of Paris is dazzling, as well as the lush, homey country at the beggining of the movie.  Furthermore, it's got enough variety into the imagined version of Paris that's it's extremely believable and not just some choked up romantic version of Paris that exists in everyone dreams (which is somewhat true, but Paris obviously has plenty of bad areas with an abscence of lights).  There's plenty of grit and grime of a real city, which is pleasing to know so, and feels very Paris in the grit and grime way.  Also worth noting is the challenged they overcame by making the actual computer generated food look somewhat delicious, and it kind of does.  Everything else is wonderfully detailed as usual, from the water, rain, to the fantastically designed interiors (!).<br /><br />Voice casting?  Ratatouille doesn't have as many big names as Cars did (the number of special people on that movie were insane!), but I'm not quite sure if Peter O' Toole's voice isn't smaller than any of them.  Come on, this was the guy that was in Lawrence of Arabia and Caligula (Yeah, why the ________ am I namedropping a pornographic movie in a review for a family film) But O' Toole or not, the other cast memembers are no slouches either.  Other big names in the adult movie world include Ian Holm, who was in Alien and Brazil, as well as Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Is Ratatouille the best Pixar movie?  No, but it's definitely up there.  And to think that a movie studio that made such a milestone like Toy Story is still releasing movies that are still pushing the envelope in what they are doing with computer animation and storytelling (maybe not storytelling since not every plot they do is that interesting to me, such as WALL-E).<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing.  Isn't the comparison to food and music absolutely dead on?  Whoa!<br /><br />B+</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"Ratatouille" is a delicious musical treat for the whole family to enjoy. From Disney, the company famous for its mouse,comes a loveable rat Remy who wants to cook up a feast. It's an inspiring fairy tale about family, love, and the power of faith. From Michael Giacchino's bistro-worthy soundtrack to the tasty intrigues of the story, "Ratatouille" is a cinematic meal.<br /><br />In "Ratatouille",Remy the rat (expertly voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt) befriends the garbage boy Linguini. As in Cyrano de Bergerac, Linguini gets the credit for Remy's amazing meals. Linguini might also be the love child of Gousteau,the chef who inspires Remy in visions. Linguini himself is smitten with the no-nonsense chef Colette (a bittersweet Jeanne Garofalo) The devious Skinner (former Bilbo Ian Holm) plans to turn Gousteau's magical recipes into instant frozen meals (like "Tooth Pickin' Chicken" and "Haggis Wraps") There's also a health inspector who bears an uncanny resemblance to Walt Disney himself. Finally,the evil cadaverous critic Anton Ego (voiced by the equally cadaverous Peter O'Toole) comes to Gousteau's with a bone to pick.<br /><br />"Ratatouille" is a delicious mix of comedy,in-jokes,and visual wonders. It's an ode to the joys of cooking and the beauty of Paris,the City of Light. It has a moral without being ponderously moralistic. As Anton Ego learns his lesson from a delicious plate of ratatouille,so does this movie please the palate. Bon appetit!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I loved this movie and saw it last weekend for the first time. It is way too cute and adorable. Ratatouille is filled with a great cast of characters, wonderful plot and storyline that keeps your attention throughout the film, and great animation. A film great to watch for the whole family.... Who can ask for anything more?</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>I found there to be quite a difference between Ratatouille and the last Disney DVD I reviewed, "Meet the Robinsons." While they were both very good, "Meet the Robinsons" was a bit more cerebral and I thought its concepts of time travel may have been a bit much for younger kids to grasp. On the other hand, Ratatouille is a true screwball comedy, almost more in the spirit of old Warner Brothers Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny cartoons. It's a pure slapstick farce, and kids will have no problem laughing their heads off here.<br /><br />Comedian Patton Oswalt shines in the lead role as Remy, a rat with an acute sense of smell and a taste for fine food. When Remy and his clan are ran out of their previous home, Remy ends up in downtown Paris at the restaurant of recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Gusteau's will calls for his restaurant to go to a family heir and if none are found, it passes to the head chef, Skinner. Of course, he does have an unknown heir working right in the restaurant. Linguini (Lou Romano) is a shy young man without the slightest bit of skills in the kitchen. That all changes when he meets Remy who hides under Linguini's hat and controls his movements to create dishes that thrill the customers at Gusteau's and rankle Skinner who is determined to find out his secrets. Gusteau's spirit visits Remy, providing sage advice along the way.<br /><br />While Linguini is learning skills from chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), Remy runs into conflict with his father Django (Brian Dennehy) who shows in rather graphic fashion, what happens when rats get too close to humans. He wants Remy to return to the clan but Remy is determined to help Linguini win the restaurant from the evil Skinner. Peter O' Toole almost steals the film near the end playing a food critic named Anton Ego who is the scourge of fine dining. His column can make or break a restaurant. And now Linguini has to cook for him without a staff and without Remy.<br /><br />No offense to Patton Oswalt, but he was born to voice a rat. His light, enthusiastic voice was the perfect match for Remy. I laughed out loud several times when Remy was under Linguini's hat and pulling his hair to drive him like a horse. There's also a great scene when the Health Inspector walks into the kitchen to see hundreds of rats scurrying about, preparing dinner. Peter Sohn as Remy's brother Emile provided further comic relief as a fattened rat who never saw a piece of trash he wouldn't eat. All of the voice talent...even the usually annoying Garofalo...turned in strong performances. The only curious scene involved Skinner trying to get Linguini to talk by getting him drunk on wine. That's an odd scene for a Disney who normally likes to avoid the remotest chance of controversy.<br /><br />There are two weaknesses to the film and DVD. First, at 1 hour and 51 minutes, it's probably too long by about 15 minutes I think. It's hard to keep the interest of young kids for close to two hours. Secondly, the special features on the DVD were light. There is a 13 minute interview with the writer and producer, three deleted scenes, an instruction with Remy on rats as your friend, and a short animated film called "Lifted". A bit skimpy for a Disney DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Take a rat, add lots of wild and dangerous chase scenes, add a few recipes, finish off with a message that may be too deep for children and you might wind up with this film.  This film is somewhere in the middle of Pixar's output.  It is not the best but not the worst.<br />Our rat is unusual.  He does not like the standard rat diet of garbage.  He has a refined palette which his family exploits to check for poison.  But he is unhappy.  A violent episode lands him in Paris where he finds the restaurant of his chef hero.  Here he has adventures with avoiding the staff and trying to cook.  Add two villains (yes, two), the restaurant's current owner and a food critic and our rat's life gets very complicated.<br />This is a long film with much of it taken up by chase scenes.  The cooking scenes are fun and clever.  But in the middle we have the lone rat who does not fit in with other rats or with people as he keeps trying to be what he is not in order to please others.  It is only in the end when he finds a way to be true to himself that things begin to go well.  Great message but a little out there for the kids.  The understood the message in Cars and The Incredibles but they didn't quite get this one as it a more adult problem.  Still, it has plenty of the tings kids like while being intelligent enough for adults.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Ratatouille" is a technical tour de force, as one would expect from Pixar.  On top of that, the characters are well-drawn (pun intended) and interesting, and the story is engaging - hallmarks of Disney animation.  And, of course, this is a funny movie.  This film is billed as a comedy, and it does not disappoint on that front.<br /><br />However, "Ratatouille" has pacing problems, and one villain too many.  The first segment of the movie lasts way too long for the amount of exposition it provides, and could have been left out altogether.  Indeed, it's interesting to watch the deleted scenes and see how Brad Bird initially planned to start the movie in Paris - a choice that probably would have benefitted the movie.  And with two villains, there comes a point 20+ minutes from the end when you abruptly think the movie must be over - but it just keeps coming because there's one more villain to deal with.<br /><br />Nevertheless, "Ratatouille" will entertain both adults and children, as Disney films always do, and is at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>This movie has a plethora of characteristics that make it remarkable, an ultra-funny script, endearing characters, superior graphics and animation, and the fact that it can be shared and loved by the whole family. However, being someone that works closely with the restaurant industry and that is en route to becoming a foodie, I was surprised by this film in terms of how well it presents the stereotypes that you are likely to find in this world. The use of satire based on these characters left me satiated and happy to have sat through a wonderful meal...err movie :)<br /><br />Every possible stereotype in the food world makes an appearance, from the bitter and lonely critic, to the egotistical chef that is not as good as others think, and he knows it. In the middle of this, we find an aloof young man starting out from the lower echelons in the kitchen of a famous restaurant, who could only succeed with the help of a real gourmet. The fact that this food connoisseur is a rodent is just a minor kink.<br /><br />I believe that most people will agree that watching this movie is a great experience, but if you are a foodie, you cannot afford to miss it. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>To finish the thought of the title of the review, who would have thought that a movie about a rat would be so great?  Apparently the great minds at Pixar/Disney that's who!<br />This is a beautiful film.  Hands down one of the most impressive examples of video quality you can find.  Reference quality.  Demo quality.  (As in used to demonstrate high-def equipment to help sell it to customers in big box stores, appliance and electronic areas in department stores, etc.)<br />The color pops, the graphics are so stunning and impressive that words escape me for adequately praising the movie and the results obtained in watching this disc.  Just absolutely great work by Pixar/Disney on the Blu-ray version of this film.<br />The movie itself is unbelievably good also.  I'm not a fan of Patton Oswalt.  I find his voice to be grating and irritating to me, and yet he fits the role he plays here perfectly and doesn't irritate at all.  While I originally assumed that I'd find the thought of a rat chef disgusting, the story is great and so entertaining that you go past all of that in mere seconds of watching the movie.<br />Add this great movie to your collection now.  Don't hestitate!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Writer and director Brad Bird offers a hilarious, generous take on food snobbery in "Ratatouille". Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose discerning palette has earned him the derision of his fellow rodents and the wrath of humans horrified to find a rat plundering their pantries. Fleeing one of his kitchen adventures, Remy lands in Paris, food snob capital of the world and home to Gusteau's, the restaurant of Remy's culinary hero. The restaurant's reputation has dimmed since the great chef's death, and a garbage boy named Linguine (Lou Romano) tampering with the soup doesn't bode well. When Remy intervenes to save the soup, he enables an unprecedented human-rat collaboration that may restore Gusteau's to its former glory -if the Head Chef (Ian Holm) doesn't sabotage his success.<br /><br />The folks at Pixar have rediscovered how to make an animated film to please all ages. "Ratatouille" is Pixar's best animated feature since 2001's "Monsters, Inc.". Adults will find plenty to laugh at, and "Ratatouille" doesn't run out of steam in 1 hour and 50 minutes. The filmmakers consulted with chef Thomas Keller and hung out in Parisian restaurants to learn the ways of the professional kitchen. They must have gotten it right, since "Ratatouille" has received high praise from French chefs. The film venerates devotion to good food while poking fun at inflexibility. Remy's gastronomic passions delight and entertain. His ambition to be something more than a thieving rat inspires sympathy. And it made me hungry!<br /><br />The DVD (Disney 2007): Bonus features are 3 deleted scenes (15 min), one featurette, and 2 short films. "Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller" (14 min) interviews the director and the chef about where they get their ideas, spontaneity, their beginnings, how they inspire and collaborate with their staffs, and their goals. "Lifted" (5 min) is a short animated film about an apprentice alien whose attempt to abduct a sleeping human meets with some obstacles. "Your Friend the Rat" (11 min) is another animated short, hosted by rats Remy and brother Emile. Remy presents the history of the contentious relationship between rats and humans. Emile introduces some rat trivia. Subtitles for the feature are available in English.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Remy (voiced by Oswell Patton) is a special rat with a talent in cooking much like his hero who happens to be a famous recently deceased chef named Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett, he gets seperated from his family and friends in a drain all the way to Paris where he is destined to live out his dreams of becoming a chef. He goes inside the popular restraunt where Gusteau build that's now run by Gusteau's assistant Skinner (Ian Holm) and now a new employee named Linguini (Lou Ramano) joins in with the crew as a janitor, but Remy helps the talentless Linguini with the soup that he spilled accidently to improve on it and the soup becomes a success with the costumers. Together Remy and Linguini work with each other to help make the restraunt more successful until Skinner gets jealous and must do something to stop him, but will Linguini and Remy's friendship last?<br /><br />co-starring the voices of Peter O'Toole, John Ratzenberger and Brian Dennehy this is Pixar and Disney at their finest! the film is a slight improvement over their very good but not great "Cars". Brad Bird (director of "The Iron Giant" and "The Incredibles") with John Lassester have just made another Pixar winner much like their "Incredibles" and has stunning CGI with an original storyline and emotion helps makes this another magical animated movie for all ages.<br /><br />This DVD contains some fairly good extras like deleted scenes, two animated shorts and a behind the scenes look at hte film with director Brad Bird chef Thomas Keller.</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>"Ratatouille" was way above my expectations when I saw it the first time. The previews didn't do much for me, however, the initial buzz was favorable so I shelled out the bucks to watch it in the theater. Now with the DVD, I can enjoy it at home--the surround sound just jumps out - a very good dynamic mix with the excellent score by Michael Giacchino). There aren't too many extras, but what is there is enjoyable. The Pixar short "Lifted" about an alien in training attempting an abduction is cute; it amazes me how Pixar is able to capture the emotion and human movements of their 3D animated characters; something that the other studios don't quite have down yet. "Lifted" was the short shown with "Ratatouille" in the theaters. There is also a another short called "Your Friend the Rat," which is the story of rats through history, showing them not to be the despicable creatures that humans make them out to be. The style of this short is traditional animation (other than the intro/ending by Remy & Emile) and very well done. I really like the sketch-like style that is used here. The DVD also has a 13:53 minute featurette that cuts between Pixar's Brad Bird and French Laundry's Thomas Keller. It is truly interesting to hear the two discuss their respective fields, and seeing just how similar the creative process and philosophies are. There are also 3 deleted scenes; all of them in rough b&w sketch form. 2 ("Meet Gusteau" and "First Day") deserved to be deleted. The scene titled "Chez Gusteau" harkens back to Hitchcock, as the camera takes you to Gusteau's restaurant, through the front door and into the kitchen, all in one continuous "take." Even in the rough form, it was great fun to watch. Yet, I understand Bird's explanation that although a good scene, it didn't fit with the perspective he wanted "Ratatouille" to have. And that my friends is it for the extras. Not fantastic, but again, what is there is solid.<br /><br />Onto the movie--I found myself enjoying the characters. Amazon.com didn't seem to like the critic character, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole). Personally, I found him to be one of my favorites. He helped add a little dark "spice" to the movie that otherwise could have been too bland. Briefly, "Ratatouille" is about a rat who loves food, and idolizes the late Chef Gusteau. When he ends up in Paris, he teams up with a klutz, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano) and helps him become a great chef in Gusteau's restaurant. Skinner, the sous chef who is more interested in pillaging the Gusteau name by slapping it on frozen dinners, becomes the nemisis of Linguini and Remy. You can watch the movie to see how all resolves.<br /><br />In the end, I believe I still prefer "The Incredibles," but boy does this one come in a close second. Great fun for the whole family to watch, although at times the slapstick is a little violent at times (in a 3 Stooges way), there is nothing too offensive here.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>Considering the Disney empire was founded on a mouse, it would be harsh to dismiss Ratatouille simply because it's about a rat as even the most rodent-phobic will be melting for this charming dish.<br /><br />This is Pixar's second collaboration with Disney since it's fusion. And while Ratatouille may lack the pioneering invention and sardonic wit of some of Pixar's previous films, there is plenty to enjoy.<br /><br />Ratatouille has a culinary flavour as it tells the story of Remy, a rat with a passion for cooking. Much of the film is set in the kitchen of Gusteau's, a restaurant so realistically rendered it's possible to almost smell the mouthwatering aromas lingering around.<br /><br />Remy is possessed with a more sophisticated taste than his brother Emile and the rest of his rat colony. He is visited by the ghost of his cooking hero, Gusteau, whose motto is 'Anyone can cook' and encourages Remy to use his catering skills to rescue his restaurant whose reputation has floundered since his passing.<br /><br />Once there, Remy befriends Linguini, the garbage boy. Hiding under Linguini's chef's hat, Remy indicates the talentless boy how to create fabulous dishes, quickly raising both Linguini's and the restaurant's reputation. Ratatouille cleverly explores the restaurant world with its envious rivalries and turbulent kitchen politics. Through stories of jealousy, intrigue, friendship and love, Ratatouille tells us what it takes to overcome a lack of self esteem and to become the person (or rat) you were meant to be.<br /><br />Ratatouille is also filled with other life's lessons. How do you deal with family members who don't see the potential in you? How do you handle people who are emotionally close to you who want you to bend the law for their benefit? Do you become something bigger than you are, or can you achieve the same results by just being honest?<br /><br />Like any good story, this one operates at many levels. Children will love the simplicity of the message, the funny chases, while adults will love the complexity and reality of the relationships. Ratatouille is the name of a simple peasant food that if prepared with care, will rival anything you can serve in the best restaurants of the world. It is also symbolic of our own lives. It may be simple, but if we lead it with care, love and kindness, it will be as good and valuable as the life of the most notorius man in the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Ratatouille tells the most unlikely story of Remy, a rat who disdains garbage and wants nothing more than to cook and eat gourmet food. Ratatouille progresses at a good pace and it held my attention all the way! The animation is excellent and the voiceovers are very nicely done.<br /><br />When the action begins, we meet Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who must run for safety along with the other rats when they are discovered by the old woman whose attic they inhabit; and this is after poor Remy has already been "relegated" to food inspector to make sure that no food is poisoned. Remy's father only complains that his son Remy is way too picky about food; and Remy's brother Emile (voiced by Peter Sohn) "tolerates" Remy even though he doesn't understand Remy's desire for gourmet food.<br /><br />After a harrowing, close escape from the woman whose house they inhabited, Remy finds himself alone in the sewers of Paris. He has lost his way and he doesn't know where his fellow rats and his family are. However, he soon discovers that he is underneath the kitchen of his idol chef, Chef Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) who has written a book entitled "Anyone Can Cook." Eventually Remy wanders into the kitchen and risks his life to see what goes on there, although he is saddened when he earlier discovers that Chef Gusteau is now deceased.<br /><br />Things become even wilder! Remy saves the day for a young, newly hired garbage boy named Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano); Linguini cooks a terrible soup and Remy secretly adds a few things to make the soup even more then perfect. Pretty soon Remy and Linguini actually form a partnership with Remy hiding under Linguini's chef cap and tugging on Linguini's hair (either left or right with his rat paws) to tell Linguini what to put in the soup to make it wonderful. Linguini's subsequent success is extremely disturbing to the crude, bullying chef in charge Chef Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm). Chef Skinner tries to get Linguini to admit that a rat is behind his success; but Linguini never admits anything even when Skinner gets him drunk.<br /><br />Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Will Skinner be able to hide the secret that the restaurant belongs to Chef Gusteau's son--Linguini? What if Linguini and Colette (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), another cook in the kitchen, begin a romance--will this complicate things or help things along? What becomes of Remy--will he stay in the kitchen working with Linguini? Will Remy ever find his family? And what happens when the nasty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole) wants to destroy Chef Gusteau's restaurant's reputation? No plot spoilers here, folks--just watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has a plethora of extras. You get an interview with the writer and producer; and there are three deleted scenes. There's also a short animated film entitled Lifted.<br /><br />Ratatouille is a strong film from Disney and Pixar, although I do agree with other reviewers that the film could have been tightened up a bit to run a few minutes shorter. This is an excellent family movie but there is, of course, the possibility that some won't be enchanted by the images of rats running en masse through restaurant kitchens. However, all of this didn't bother me too much, so I heartily recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>This may very well be Pixar's best film and that's no small feat.<br />I can't believe they could come up with such and incredible movie based on quiet a disgusting subject matter but there is no question the people at Pixar have pulled it off.  Ratatouille and the Toy Story movies are the only computer animated movies I can remmember in which I've found myself smiling from begging to end. My favorite scene was probably Remy cooking two omelettes, a large one for his friend, a small one for himself.<br />I love the fact that, unlike every other animated movie today, Pixar's have no current pop references and also unlike them, they will stand the test of time.<br />To learn the insipid Shrek 3 made more money than Ratatouille is frankly puzzling and I for one can not find any explanation whatshoever.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Brad Bird's delightful "Ratatouille" has proven yet again what we already know. That is, you don't need a big name or catchy music to make a great animation. All you need is believable characters you can relate to and an interesting story driven by them even though one of the characters is actually a most incredible creation -- a French gourmet rat named Remy, who goes to Paris and establishes friendship with a shy boy working in the kitchen of a (formerly) five-star restaurant.<br /><br />Brad Bird, who scored a one-two punch by giving us two fantastic animations, anmely "The Iron Giant" and "The Incredibles," has created one of the most charming characters in the movie history in Remy, a rat who loves cooking more than anything. The lovable rat's colorful facial and bodily expressions of emotions are always amusing to see, with dynamic movements that only gifted animators can create. (Look close at the end of the film and its "No motion capture" credit.)<br /><br />Not many words are necessary to describe the pure joy of watching this amazing animation. Enjoy the unpredictable story of Remy's adventures plus colorful world of his kitchen. And the film concludes with a strong statement about critic's role, which is quietly done but most biting.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Websites that track positive and negative reviews from the major critics register a positive score of at least 95% for Ratatouille, clearly putting it at the top of the films of 2007.  Is it the best film of the year?  No, but it's the one with the greatest appeal, as nearly everyone will consider viewing it to be a positive experience.<br /><br />Ratatouille follows Remy, a curious rat who aspires to be more than a garbage thief.  Remy's acute sense of smell and appreciation for food attract him to the culinary arts.  By stealing what he can from a elderly homeowners appreciation for cooking shows and books, Remy becomes a devotee of one of France's most famous chefs, Auguste Gusteau'.  After Remy learns that Gusteau died years and he had been watching reruns of his television program, the little rat begins to be guided Ben Kenobi-like by the spirit of the dead chef.<br /><br />Following the spirit eventually leads him to Gusteau's former restaurant, which has been taken over by a artless capitalist who uses Gusteau's image to sell frozen burritos and corndogs.  By using a young kitchen worker as a medium, Remy tries to rebuild the reputation of Gusteau and return his restaurant to its glory.<br /><br />The resulting action is an often charming tale of a rat as much devoted to finding himself as achieving his goal.  Lots of laughs are found when his family shows up looking for handouts, and the chief antagonists (the owner and a food critic) create real dramatic moments of peril.  Remy is truly a film "hero", someone devoted to a cause that he believes will make the world a better place.  Although lacking the heart of the Toy Story films or the comic brilliance of the first Shrek, Ratatouille continues the trend of the animation renaissance that has provided some of the best films of the last decade.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>An astonishingly unconventional plot brings audiences to the streets of Paris where an anthropomorphic rat aids a floundering chef in cooking superlative cuisines in Pixar's Ratatouille. Thanks to director Brad Bird and his masterful direction, we're sucked into this exquisite story. With breathtaking animation as only Pixar can provide, nonstop comedy, James Bond-esque chase sequences, and wildly caricatured characters, Ratatouille is easily one of the best films of the summer.<br /><br />Remy the rat (Patton Oswalt) has an unusually refined sense of smell and taste and quickly aspires to eat only the finest foods as opposed to rifling through garbage and stealing food like his family regularly does. His father warns him of the dangers of humans (they are dangerous to rats as well as merfolk) but during a rapid escape from their compromised home, Remy is separated and lost down the unforgiving tunnels of a sewer. When he finally clamors to the top, guided by his role model's ghostlike guiding spirit (the late, great Chef Gusteau) he realizes he's in Paris and right next to Gusteau's five-star restaurant. Determined to live his dreams of becoming a chef, he saves a recently hired, bumbling garbage boy named Linguini (Lou Romano) from disaster and embarrassment, and forms an unlikely partnership. Remy puppeteers Linguini (while hiding under his toque) making him appear to be a talented chef. Linguini's suspicious and conniving boss Skinner (Ian Holm) and the specter-like food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) are the only two who stand in their way of living their dreams and proving to themselves and their families how the most unusual circumstances can lead to success - and that anyone can cook.<br /><br />A classic example of Pixar's signature ability to select the most inspiringly unique stories as well as to throw conventionality out the window, Ratatouille makes use of extreme contrasts in its principal ideas. A rat, typically despised - especially in the kitchen - unites with a human to live out his dreams as a chef. The plausibility of this contrary scheme is low, but with the amazing character development we're sucked into the fictitious world that is so vividly painted onscreen. On an unrelated note, Pixar once again tacks on an animated short film to the beginning of the feature, this time a science fiction piece entitled "Lifted", which beautifully sets up the mood for Ratatouille's stellar story.<br /><br />Several noteworthy contrasts and singular ideas surface consistently throughout Ratatouille. Similar to Toy Story, in which the toys don't allow humans to notice their anthropomorphic qualities, the rats in Ratatouille keep their actions out of sight. They squeak when they talk (from human perspective), yet they ride boats during an escape, and Remy can read books. Are they unable to achieve human characteristics when humans aren't present? Technical contrasts exist in the editing and cinematography, including humorous transitions from Colette's face to that of Ego's malicious grimace, and rapid night-to-day cuts. Often overlooked and yet perhaps the most stunning aspect of the film is the way the camera moves: dollies, pans, and chases that carefully follow movements perfectly mimic the way a camera is used in live action, yet there are no real cameras at all. This perfect mimicry of actual cameras allows the viewer to follow the events of the CG characters exactly as if they were real, which of course adds to the precision and naturalism.<br /><br />All of the visual aspects of the film are absolutely praiseworthy. The photorealism of textures and environments continue to be near perfection and, in typical Disney fashion, the lead characters are crafted as caricatures and have exaggerated cartoon qualities. Gusteau, Linguini, Colette and the rest of the kitchen staff are all creatively skewed from standard human dimensions and proportions, while the inanimate object all remain realistically fashioned. But this familiar contrast in animated films helps emphasize the nonstop comedy and cheerful tone that permeates every scene. And most often the comical scenes involve a frantic, fast-paced chase through sea, land and air, much like James Bond's notorious opening sequence stunts. Director Brad Bird's tight direction keeps the action as intense and unpredictable as the jokes are funny.<br /><br />Full of wonderfully inventive ideas, from placing a rat in the kitchen, using Gusteau's spirit as a guide (who regularly admits to being a mere figment of Remy's imagination), to the wonderfully caricatured cast, Pixar has itself another winner. Despite the unexplained language barriers and farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious film doesn't ever become too preachy or too immature and always maintains a high level of pure entertainment.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has a refined sense of smell and a love of good food.  His hero is the late, great chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), and thanks to his TV show and cookbook, Remy has the knowledge to be one of the best chefs in the world.  The only problem?  Remy's a rat.<br /><br />When Remy's family is forced to evacuate their home, Remy gets separated from them.  He winds up in Paris just outside of Gusteau's restaurant.  Since he can't resist seeing where his idol once worked, Remy sneaks inside.<br /><br />And that's how Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano).  Linguini is the new garbage boy at the restaurant, and he's something of a klutz.  When Linguini accidentally ruins a soup, Remy can't help but fix it.  The new recipe is a huge success, but only Linguini knows that a rat made it.<br /><br />And so beings their partnership.  Remy provides the cooking knowledge and Linguini provides the human form.  Together, they begin to turn the reputation of the restaurant around.  But can they keep their secret hidden?<br /><br />I have been a Pixar fan since Toy Story was released, but this was the first one I didn't love.  Maybe it's director Brad Bird since I didn't like his The Iron Giant, and I had to watch The Incredibles a couple times before I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Maybe I'll enjoy this one more after I see it a few more times because there are lots of things to recommend it.  There are some truly funny parts, especially the scenes where Remy is trying to control Linguini.  And their first scene working together is a riot as well.  The animation is wonderful with a few breath taking shots of Paris.  And I liked the fact that Remy could only talk to other rats.  The fact that the humans and animals couldn't talk is a nice twist on the standard animated film.  And the animators do a great job of using body language to convey their characters every thought and feeling.  And the voice cast of well knowns and unknowns does an excellent job.<br /><br />So where exactly did the movie fall apart?  It was just too busy.  Remy has a storyline with a couple plots.  Linguini has his own issues.  And neither one is really given time to develop fully.  We focus on one issue for a while, then move on to something else.  Item three gets resolved, then we get item four before going back to two, then five, then....  You get the idea.  If they had taken out one of the sub-plots, anyone of them, it would have allowed more time to better develop the plots that remained and even develop the characters better.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the movie really isn't aimed at kids.  I'm not arguing with the G rating.  There just isn't that much action to hold their interest.  Elementary age and above should be able to track the story, so they will enjoy it more.<br /><br />This is an entertaining movie that is worth seeing.  Just don't go expecting the great story telling that Pixar usually provides.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>Pixar and director Brad Bird hits another one out of the park with an entertaining, funny and even informative take on haute cuisine. Ratatouille combines themes such as a rags to riches story, father and son dynamics, living a double life, and of course rats and food. Pixar has always been good with smart family entertainment and this movie is no different. My four year old son loves it. My 20 year old daughter loves it. I love it. This is one of those films that will undoubtedly endure the test of time.<br /><br />The basic story is a rat with a keen sense of smell and a love for making food gets separated from his family and ends up at the restaurant of his favorite chef. In a strange turn of events Remy (the rat voiced by Patton Oswalt) creates a soup that everybody loves, but credit was given to the garbage boy. Remy and said garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) come up with a plan to keep Remy cooking with Linguini as the cover. From there you get plenty of hijinks, cartoon thrills, a little romance, some character development, and all around fun times.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how good the animation is on a movie. If the script doesn't deliver the movie won't either (just look at Final Fantasy). Ratatouille's is sharp. It hits all the marks in story development and gives a really nice pacing on events. My only gripe is there was an action scene or two that felt forced just to add some excitement while not really lending to the story very well. Other than that the plot was pitch perfect.<br /><br />While a great story is the backbone to a good movie good animation doesn't hurt. I can't really say much that most people who watch Pixar movies already know. The animation excels. The fine details from the hairs on the rats and humans to the look of the food to the stylistic backgrounds. It all shows quality. I can't help think a bit of The Incredibles theory is in the design, which would make sense considering Brad Bird directed that one too.<br /><br />Another thing that can make or break the immersion level of an animated movie is the sound and voice acting. Pixar always finds a way to get the best out of their actors and make them sound like professional voice talents. It's all great, but I would like to make note of my personal standouts. Lou Romano as Linguini gives a ton of character for somebody who doesn't have much of a voice acting background (he's a design artist). I didn't recognize comedian Janeane Garofalo as Colette she was so convincing. More so for Ian Holm as the main villain Skinner. He knocked it out of the park for me with that outlandish character. Then you have Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. This man steals the show with his voice and the subtle intonation in his performance resonates.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is a re-release of the 2007 Blu-Ray with an additional DVD version added. The special features are identical to the previous release. Here's what you get(* denotes feature on the DVD as well):<br /><br />Pixar Shorts*:<br /><br />Lifted - One of my favorite shorts about an alien abduction... final exam. The human character looks a lot like our human hero Linguini from the movie.<br /><br />Your Friend the Rat - This is actually a very educational and informative short on the history of rats and their relationship to human society. It's told by Remy and his brother and is very entertaining.<br /><br />Fine Food & Film* - Interesting featurette with Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller on the food designed for the movie.<br /><br />Cine-Explore - Tons of mini documentaries and interviews can be picked up while watching the movie. Just about everything you wanted to know. I believe you can get this stuff on the main menu as well without using Cine-Explore.<br /><br />Gusteau's Gourmet Game - Never played it. Supposed to be Linguini making food during an increasingly busy meal rush.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes* - Three of them, and they are not finished beyond rough animation. Interesting stuff, but nothing you would have missed.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes R.I.P. - More deleted scenes. I haven't seen them, but I heard they are better than the previous deleted scenes.<br /><br />I am assuming the Easter Eggs are also still in here. Wait for the rat to appear on the main menu and then hit the left directional key. You get five bonus items on an hidden menu.<br /><br />Ratatouille is an amazingly entertaining film and this release has a lot of great extras on top of a great movie. If you have one of those households that has both Blu-Ray players and DVD players (maybe in the kids room) this is a good buy as it keeps both version inside one case. If you are a BD or DVD only household it may be better for you to go for the 2007 release if it's cheaper.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>When the trailers for this film first started their television run, I had some reservations about it.  Here we have a movie about a rat, the most disgusting of creatures, with culinary ambitions in France!!!<br /><br />Heaven forbid!<br /><br />However, after having seen the film, I had to change my tune.  "Ratatouille" is a thoroughly entertaining movie that is perfect family fare for the summer.<br /><br />Of course, some of the storyline is bit above the heads of the real small fry (They need a little more appreciation of the restaurant biz).  However, that aside, the movie carries on the tradition of wholesome entertainment, started by the late Mr. Disney.<br /><br />In fact, "Ratatouille" probably comes closest to being in the Disney mold than any of the previous Disney/Pixar collaborations in terms of story, attention to detail, scoring, and inspired casting.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole and Brad Garrett are fantastic in their small but significant roles.<br /><br />And the scenes of Paris: "Tres magnifique!"</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Remy (Oswalt) is a rat who wants to be a chef.  He has refined senses and refuses to eat the garbage that other rats eat.  They use him as a "poison detector", a job which he despises.  One day, he meets Linguini (Romono), a janitor at Gusteau's, a famous Paris restaurant.  Hiding under his hat, Remi can manipulate Linguini into creating amazing dishes.  Soon, everyone is talking about this new chef, but the chef whose position he has usurped (Holm) wants revenge.  Renowned food critic Anton Ego (O'Toole) is also reviewing the restaurant, and Remi and Linguini may be in over their heads.<br /><br />"Ratatouille" is the latest in the string of great movies from Pixar.  It's a notch below last year's "Cars", but still better than the majority of animated movies that have come out in the last decade.  The humor works on two levels as has become Pixar's standard.  Kids and adults alike will enjoy this film.  The voice talents are mostly lesser names, and that works fine; they all suit their characters.  "Ratatouille" is a great film that young and old can enjoy together.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>Before I saw The Incredibles all I knew about Brad Bird was that he was a character designer and animator for The Simpsons and he made the very underrated The Iron Giant. After I saw what he could do with CGI animation I became a Brad Bird believer. You can guess that I was excited to see Ratatouille. Bird is a writer/director that doesn't dumb down animation. For some reason it's believed that animation is for kids only. Television has proved that there is an audience in the key 18-49 demographic for animation. Brad Bird makes movies that can be viewed by anyone, and Ratatouille is no exception.<br /><br />Ratatouille is the story of a rat named Remy who lives with his father and brother and their colony. Remy enjoys good food while his family enjoys eating trash. He wishes one day that he could leave the gutters and go out in the world to cook and create different flavors. After a near-death incident he is separated from his family. While he is alone he conjures up in his imagination the spirit of Chef Gusteau, his idol. Gusteau basically acts as Remy's conscience for the duration of the movie. When Remy discovers he actually lives in Paris he accidentally gets trapped in Gusteau's former restaurant. Linguini is our human protagonist and was just hired as a trash boy for the kitchen. When Remy creates a brilliant soup it is Linguini who gets credit for it and now the two team up to become the best thing to hit Paris. The film is full of colorful characters that are not empty or dull. Every character is developed and completes some journey in this film, which you don't usually see. Usually only your hero goes through the journey, but we come to terms with every fantastic character in the film.<br /><br />The great thing about Ratatouille is that Brad Bird does not dumb the story down just because it's animation. He plays everything for real even though his main character is a talking rat. You see other movies like Meet The Robinsons which have clich&eacute;d characters and humor dumbed down for kids because it's much easier that way. What Brad Bird does is he crafts a story that is simple enough for children to follow and enjoy but he delevopes it in a mature way that an older audience can watch and relate to. During my screening I heard countless of kids asking their parents "what is going on"? So, there are things here that may fly over a child's head. Things like flashbacks to the childhood of an evil food critic that awakens the life inside of him, blossoming love between two co-workers, or Gusteau's replacement hiding from Linguini that he is the biological heir to the restaurant. The way I saw it is that Remy's story was for the kids. He is a rat who wants to cook and has to overcome society's view of him in order to make it. Linguini's story is for the older audiences as it deals with more real life things kids can't relate to yet. Overall this is a brilliant animated film that makes me love Brad Bird as a filmmaker even more.<br /><br />Another aspect that has to be admired is that the animators have done a wonderful job creating a believable environment. Character design is one thing in animation, but it's the stuff that you don't notice that is the most important. The design of the interiors, the walls, the doors, the floor tiles, the clothing on the characters, the streets, the way the light falls and everything else. I was just amazed at how much detail went into this film. I tried to imagine this as a small budget romantic comedy and felt like the sets were real. The majority of the film takes place in the one restaurant, but the restaurant feels like a world in itself. The film was just simply amazing to watch.<br /><br />One thing that I still remember about The Incredibles is Michael Giacchino's incredible (no pun intended) score. Giacchino has come a long way from scoring video games and thanks to his work on the show Lost he is finally getting some recognition. The role Giacchino's score plays in this movie is indescribable, and it should be since its music and music needs to be heard. It completes the atmosphere that Brad Bird has created. It gives it that French flare that makes you believe you are in France. The score is quiet at times but will kick it up in a jazzy way from time to time. Giacchino composed a song with singer Camille that plays halfway through the film and during the end. It is a perfect incorporation of the themes and gives the film that perfect flavor. I don't speak French so I don't know the vocals, but it's a beautiful piece.<br /><br />We also get some great voice acting. Patton Oswalt was a delight as Remy. Ian Holm played the evil cook, Skinner and you would never know it was him hiding his British accent with a French one. Brad Garret plays the spirit of Chef Gusteau while Janeane Garofalo plays the voice of Linguini's love interest. Linguini himself is played by voice actor Lou Romano. Rounding out the great cast is Peter O' Toole as Anton Ego the evil food critic.<br /><br />The film was a delight. It was beautiful and heartwarming featuring a brilliant story about finding one's self, but most importantly it was original. It wasn't like the rehashed crud you usually find in theaters, and I'm speaking on behalf of both animation and live-action. Brad Bird is a grand talent in the world of animation.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>"Ratatouille" is not just the best animated film directed by Brad Bird, whose previous efforts include "The Incredibles" and "The Iron Giant". It is a hilarous, heart-warming comedy about life, love and friendship which will leave both a warm glow in your heart and stomach long after you leave the movie theater. Pixar Studios has wrought in vivid animation, a wonderful valentine to Paris and to the art of fine cuisine, using state-of-the-art techniques that provide this exquisite animated film a grand sense of realism which I've found lacking in many of the recent cinematic summer blockbusters of 2007; if there is one film from this season that will be remembered as an enduring cinematic classic, then I strongly suspect that film will be "Ratatouille".<br /><br />"Ratatouille" is more than an intriguing Gallic twist on the time-worn tale of the country bumpkin who arrives in the big city, and unexpectedly, becomes someone recognized for his superb artistic craft. It's a hilarious look at friendship and personal relationships seen largely through the eyes of the French rat Remy (well-voiced by Patton Oswalt in a truly significant performance) who transforms both his excellent sense of smell and devotion to the culinary art of the late great French chef Gusteau (who also becomes quite literally, Remy's personal muse in brief appearances which resemble either Obi-Wan Kenobi's or Michael Behe's "Intelligent Designer"; I'm more inclined to think of Gusteau as a culinary version of Kenobi.), becoming the "Little Chef" of the befuddled young garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano), the newest employee of Gusteau's once posh Parisian restaurant, now under the strict thumb of the meglomanic head chef Skinner (Ian Holm). A dazzling set of spectacular adventures await both Linguini and his rodent friend Remy, culminating in a final culinary showdown with Skinner and Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), Paris' legendary restaurant critic, set largely in some of the most authentic-looking depictions of a restaurant's kitchen that I have seen either in animation or live action. With "Ratatouille" director Brad Bird and his crew have crafted an animated film which continues the Disney tradition of great animation, and a state-of-the-art example of animated cinema which will be recognized for years as one of the artistic landmarks of this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Ratatouille" is brilliant!

This is brilliant and different than any animated film out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>Being a rat doesn't stop young Remy (Patton Oswalt) from knowing good food when he sees it. In fact, while his family and other rats are content to gnaw at whatever they get--literally including garbage, our young protagonist seriously dreams of becoming a famous chef!<br /><br />Unbeknownst to his family, Remy had been sneaking into the kitchen of their 'house'. He was studying the French cookbooks of the departed Auguste Gusteau. Diligence pays off when Remy helps the son of the deceased follow in his fathers' footsteps.<br /><br />Remy receives the dream of being able to cook, but the road to culinary fame is not without its bumps and internal squabbling from the chef and the human beneficiary of those talents. Remembering who your friends are is very important as is not leaving them when they have helped you achieve the success you always wanted.<br /><br />Those dramatic elements made the consistency of this family film much more appetizing for an adult palette in contrast to a screenplay where all of the 'good' characters conveniently have worked out issues before we see them. I had honestly thought the idea of a film about a rat cooking food was gross upon first hearing, but this multi-layered plot humanized the main character to the point where it became a non-issue.<br /><br />The animation and graphics are okay. Early in the screenplay, I figured out that it really wasn't the reason why I and other patrons need to be watching this film. Pixar's made lots of progress, but special effects ultimately were not the focus of the production team.<br /><br />Some people are going to find this script political/preachy (and could be offended by it). The studio is trying to encourage audiences to not give up on our dreams, regardless of the size of our obstacles or even what our family initially thinks of us for pursuing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Anytime Pixar releases a new film, the question is: Have they done it again? They have raised the bar so high with their string of inventive, imaginative, beautifully animated films they are now in competition with themselves. So when "Cars" came out, it was a fun film, but it was no "Toy Story". When I told a co-worker that I had seen the sneak preview of Pixar's newest "Ratatouile", they immediately said, "Don't tell me they did it again?"<br /><br />Yes, they have done it again. "Ratatouile" is a great animated film. It isn't their funniest film, but it is one of their best. It seems like director Brad Bird is trying to create a more film like animated feature. His film just happens to be animated and have talking rats.<br /><br />"Ratatouile" is fantastic. And for many reasons.<br /><br />First and foremost is director Brad Bird. Bird worked for a while on "The Simpsons" and then went on to direct an animated film called "The Iron Giant". "Giant" tells the story of a young boy who finds a robot who looks like he was transported from a 50s Sci-Fi film. Because of this, the film has a decidedly retro look and appears very traditionally animated. As a result, Warner Bros. buried the film and it never achieved the audience it deserved. Then Bird moved on to Pixar and directed "The Incredibles". In one word: Incredible. This was the animated version of a James Bond film and a super hero film all rolled into one. Great characters. Great animation. Great story. "The Incredibles" is one of my favorite films of all time.<br /><br />Now Bird returns with this very different film that shares one similarity. In both cases, Bird seems to be making films that just happen to be animated. He crafts the story and the characters with such remarkable ability, making them appear as though they are human actors. And I think this will help his films transcend and become classics remembered by future generations.<br /><br />The beauty of "Ratatouile" is that it takes our misconceptions, our prejudices and some of the reality of life in Paris, and a gourmet restaurant, and combines them into a very amusing mix. It continues the Pixar tradition of building real worlds, real environments for these characters, making the films a little more genuine in the long run. As with all Pixar films, the animation is stunning, but in "Ratatouile", they have gone even one step further. The backgrounds, the textures, the appliances, Remy's fur, are almost photo realistic. Even the facial expressions and mannerisms of the characters seem real and if they didn't look like cartoon characters, you might think they were human.<br /><br />Remy (comedian Patton Oswalt, who has a lot of television work to his credit) is a rat who lives with his father and the rest of their large clan, in the French countryside. While his father, his brother, Emile (Peter Sohn) and the rest of the clan are happy to eat garbage, Remy aspires to something greater. He sneaks into the cottage of an old woman and learns of a famous chef, Gusteau (Brad Garrett, TV's "Everybody Loves Raymond"). The chef is on the old woman's television set and his bestselling cookbook, "Everyone Can Cook" is on her shelf. Remy steals the cookbook and one thing leads to another and he ends up in Paris. When he arrives at Gusteau's, the famous chef has passed away from heartbreak; one of his famed five stars was recently taken away by the evil food critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole). But the famous chef appears as Remy's alter ego when the rat gets trapped in the kitchen. Linguini (Lou Romano) is hired to be the new garbage boy despite the misgivings of the new head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) who regards the boy suspiciously. After Linguini ruins a pot of soup, Remy can't resist sneaking up to the pot and creating a masterpiece. But Linguini is given credit for the soup and the garbage boy soon realizes the rat made the soup and they work out a deal. But Skinner becomes suspicious and is convinced there is a rat. Linguini meets the one female chef in the kitchen, Collette (Janeane Garofolo) and she resents that she has to teach the new boy about the kitchen. When word of the new soup meets Ego's ears, he decides to review the restaurant again, causing everyone to panic.<br /><br />Incredibly, there is a lot more to the story that I haven't even touched.<br /><br />I wouldn't recognize Patton Oswalt if he was standing directly in front of me, but he does a great job providing the voice for Remy. He has a lot of television work to his credit and has been around a while. Oswalt brings a quiet angst to the role; Remy wants to be so much more than he is and all of the people around him aren't willing to support this, so he becomes frustrated. He knows there is more to the world and it is inconceivable that his family isn't interested in finding out more.<br /><br />Throughout the film, he talks to Gusteau, who becomes his alter ego. Their conversations are funny and help to create one of the most unusual animated duos to appear on screen in some time. Gusteau actually wants to help Remy become a chef and this rings very true. For a famous chef, who wrote a cookbook called "Anyone Can Cook", it would be natural for him to want to help anyone or anything that even expressed a desire.<br /><br />Brad Garrett is great as Gusteau. It takes a lot of work to even identify the voice as Garrett, and really the tell is the deep timbre of Gusteau's voice. Garrett doesn't play the role like a French Caricature, which helps to balance the film a little. He is merely very enthusiastic and the enthusiasm shows throughout.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance of "Ratatouille" is how the film plays with both the stereotypes and misconceptions of the French and some of the more realistic aspects of life in Paris. The film begins with a prologue setting up the status of Gusteau. A news story talks about his life, his bestselling cookbook and his famed restaurant. It also introduces the food critic, Anton Ego, when the story reveals how Gusteau's restaurant received five stars, then had one taken away. I have seen many articles about famous French chefs who have become suicidal when one of their Michelin stars was taken away. This is the type of detail the little kids in the audience would never get, but some of the adults might, and it helps to make the experience more interesting for them.<br /><br />Because Gusteau is so natural and seems so realistic, this provides a nice counterpoint to Skinner, the sous chef who takes over when Gusteau dies. Skinner, played by Ian Holm, is the complete opposite of Gusteau. Nervous his new empire might be taken away, scheming to make more money, and going a little crazy because he believes Linguini has a rat in his toque, Holm plays the character very broad but it works very well. He has the energy level and instincts of Wile E. Coyote. It is a fun performance and the character is great.<br /><br />Janeane Garofolo plays Collette, the one female chef in the kitchen. Because of this, she is very tough and protective of her position. So, naturally, she resents having to baby-sit the new chef. But she also becomes Linguini's friend and ally, until she feels she has been betrayed. It is a nice performance, one that could easily be found in a non-animated film. Because it is fairly realistic, it helps "Ratatouile" seem more believable, more natural.<br /><br />The big surprise for me was Peter O'Toole. I didn't realize the actor was even involved and it took me a while to place him as the food critic Anton Ego. O'Toole brings every nuance of his voice to the evil, stern character. Tall, with a hawk like nose, Ego walks into a room and expects to be noticed, but he doesn't acknowledge anyone who does notice him, which makes him all the more menacing. O'Toole does a great job of giving the character a lot of depth and menace. There is a brilliant scene late in the film which helps to make the character all the more believable.<br /><br />There are so many levels at work in "Ratatouile" I have only managed to scratch the surface. Brian Dennehy plays one of the characters and John Ratzenberger also provides a voice. It wouldn't be a Pixar film without him, would it?<br /><br />"Ratatouile" is a great animated film.<br /><br />As is the tradition with Pixar films, they are showing an animated short before the main feature. "Lifted", directed by Gary Rydstrom (an Oscar Winning sound engineer many times over for many feature films) tells the story of an alien cadet who is trying to pass one of his tests. The test? To extract a sleeping farmer from his bed in his farmhouse and bring him up to the spaceship. His instructor looks on with great displeasure. This is a hilarious delight and a great way to set the mood for the rest of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>That wonderful company Pixar gambled on a Parisian rat with big dreams, and it scored big time with audiences(gross: $200 million) and critics even loved it!!!!!!!!!

Good, clean, laughable fun for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Rats and mice and rabbits make favorite characters of many movies, both Disney and non-Disney.  Whether it be Mouse Hunt, Stuart Little, or the various Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny cartoons, they range from average to good, with an occasional cult classic like Mouse Hunt.  Then Pixar came along with this full-length feature, Ratatouille.  Packing romance, comedy and a little suspense into the streets of Paris with a prologue in the French countryside, this is my favorite movie by Pixar so far.  Several strands of the movie pick up from previous Pixar releases, the key one being the dual male leads, Remy and Linguini, which is found in Monsters Inc, Cars, Toy Story, and Up.  Another feature shared with previous Pixar films is the seamless and flawless interactions between the human characters and the non-human ones.  In this case, the relationship between the rats and people as shown in this movie look so real and logical, with perfect animation of facial expressions and movements.<br /><br />Now to the package.  Like other Disney releases, we get a Blu-ray and DVD containing identical features; the film, deleted scenes, the Pixar short, and the extra film that comes only with the package.  In this case, the latter is a "documentary" narrated by Remy about the relationship between rats and people over the years.  This extra film is actually funnier than the Pixar short and the feature film itself.  The deleted scenes are all partially animated, and nothing noteworthy to speak of.  All in all, a great buy for the family.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Like every single one of Pixar's films, this was witty, beautiful and genuine, but in the end felt like light fare compared to some of the studio's masterworks. It didn't have the suspense of The Incredibles, the heart of Up or the scale of Wall-E, for example, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. The script had a few legit family-friendly laughs and the animation had some moments of inspiration, (I really liked the visualizations of competing/combining flavors) and it gets points for trying out a unique setting but this never really had that moment where everything shifted into overdrive. Ah, well. My least favorite Pixar effort is still better than most of the competition.</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>I very much enjoyed this movie, as I like just about anything French.

The story's funny, the CGI is gorgeous, the relationship between rat and cook is endearing, and the villain and his motives believable. Overall, I can't really complain about this movie, so two thumbs up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>I wondered why Pixar picked this as a title for their new movie, considering that it's a French dish and you need to educate people how to pronounce it on the movie poster itself; but by the time you've seen the movie to the end it becomes apparent why it could not be called anything else. Pixar seems to have been making kids movies that adults can enjoy, but this seems to me to be the first time they've made an adult movie that kids can enjoy.<br /><br />I was a bit sceptical about this film at first, since the trailers didn't make it look very interesting - sort of ho-hum like Flushed Away or something - but the reviews were all so glowing (the Rotten Tomatoes critics poll gave it a 96 percent approval) that I had to see it. And it really lived up to those reviews. The film is about a rat that wants to cook, and while the UB40 song "Rat in the Kitchen" is never used, the idea of rats being icky creatures to be banished from the kitchen is a sqeamish thought that's... never really addressed here.  It kind of makes me think of an essay I read in Esquire in the mid-80s about the 50 most influential people of the 20th century (so far).  One of them was Walt Disney, and the hypothesis of the essay is that Disney could take a story like Franz Kafka's the Metamorphosis and turn it into a song and dance with a cute cockroach and melt everyone's hearts (which they tried to do with "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"). Well, Disney put clothes on a rat and called him Mickey, but Pixar pushed the envelope a bit by putting a real, raw rat in the kitchen and asked us to be happy that he's handling the foodstuffs without a proper de-lousing.  And we fell for it.  Does this mean that Pixar is clever, or does this mean that we're idiots?  Well, Disney was never as bold, and now Pixar has taken the step that that Esquire article warned us about.  Hilarious.<br /><br />As good as Pixar is, it has gotten a bit derivative recently - the Incredibles, as good as the film was, ripped off both the Watchmen (plot) and the Fantastic Four (powers, villain).  Cars was a rehash of "Doc Hollywood," but with automobiles.  But Ratatouille is something different.  There are bizarre non-sequitars: where are the female rats in all this, why not show more of Remy's childhood to understand how he became so interested in cooking rather than introduce him as if he were a character in "Trainspotting"; and Linguini's abrupt romance is a bit difficult to understand.<br /><br />But never mind, the story of the little restaurant that could... then couldn't... then could again is quite a lot of fun.  Sure there's that icky part where the friends' conflicting emotions cause them to momentarily betray each other (every movie needs its movie cliche), but the way the ending is wrapped up is quite impressive.  I don't remember the last time an animated movie about rats that cook brought a tear to my eye either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>Remy is an ordinary rat with extraordinarily acute senses. This leads him to a love of the finer flavors food has to offer, much to the puzzlement of his garbage eating brethren. His father has made him the clan's rat-poison detector, but Remy secretly yearns to become a great chef, and he risks life and limb to learn how by getting dangerously close to the human world. One night, however, things go horribly wrong and the whole group is forced to scatter from the cottage they have been furtively inhabiting. Remy soon finds himself separated from the others, being swept away through the sewer system and coming up under a fine restaurant in the heart of Paris. It's a dream come true for Remy, but when he can't control his urge to tamper with the dishes, he soon finds himself in a deceptive partnership with the hapless new garbage-boy, Alfredo Linguini. With Remy literally under his hat, Linguini quickly becomes the hot new chef in the city of light! But his boss, head chef Skinner, smells a rat, and the famed food critic Anton Ego poses no less a danger; not to mention the health inspector!<br /><br />To the Disney animation fan, "Ratatouille" may evoke memories of a cartoon short called "Ben and Me," or even the classic story of Cyrano de Bergerac. But, don't sell this film short based on that. It's full of originality, heart, fun, excitement, and charm! Heavy on the Euro-atmosphere, and appropriately so, "Ratatouille" dives deep into the world of the culinary arts, making it a perfect film for an age when Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray are household names and shows like "Iron Chef" are hot stuff! Patton Oswalt is the star of the show as the perfect voice for the endearing Remy the rat, whose desire to be a great chef fuels his hope for a world where humans and rats can live together with mutual respect. The entire film is a feast for the senses in itself, as one always expects from PIXAR, and I definitely would call it several steps up from their last offering, "Cars," which I found to be enjoyable, but not quite up to expectations (storywise). "Ratatouille," on the other hand, is fairly unpredictable, smart, and thoroughly enjoyable, and, in my opinion, among PIXAR's best stuff. Director Brad Bird's animation track record remains excellent!<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is the deeper level to the film's story that may click with animation fans if they dare to take a closer look. "Ratatouille" could almost be called PIXAR's autobiography, telling the story of how a little studio that was bringing something new to the table had to stand on the shoulders of a giant and struggle to earn respect and a following amidst doubting peers, patrons, and critics. Deceased master chef Gusteau is clearly a take on the great Walt Disney himself, with his restaurant representing the Disney Studios trying to keep the magic going without him (and sticking to his proven recipes). Of course, looking at the film in that light puts an entirely different spin on it and opens the gates to all sorts of fascinating ideas as to just what PIXAR is saying about whom.<br /><br />This thankfully widescreen DVD edition, unfortunately, is less than worthy of the masterpiece it holds. Probably in an effort to encourage upgrading to Blu-Ray, but perhaps for other reasons, PIXAR has really gone downhill in the extras department. There are some sweet ones, but so few in comparison to previous releases, particularly those two-discers that came out prior to the "Cars" DVD. All this edition offers are 3 deleted scenes (though nicely put together), 2 Easter Eggs, a featurette where director Brad Bird and chef Thomas Keller talk about their passions for their work, and the highlights, two original animated shorts. The first short is "Lifted," the theatrical short that was shown with "Ratatouille." This is a cute, physical comedy short about an alien abductor in training who is having trouble beaming up his sleeping victim. The second one I found HIGHLY enjoyable. It's called, "Your Friend the Rat," and is a hilarious lesson in rat-history hosted by Remy and his brother, Emile. What makes this particularly enjoyable is how its random art styles hark back to the days of Ludwig Von Drake and shorts like, "It's Tough to be a Bird." A wonderful treat for the fan of classic Disney animation, and a fine compliment to another outstanding PIXAR feature achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>This is the best movie Pixar has done since Toy Story, not only taking computer animation to the next level, but returning to the fun story telling that propelled Toy Story.  I hope that Pixar includes a couple shorts with the movie, like the amusing "Lifted," which served as a prelude to the movie in the theatres.  I think the creators owe a big debt to The Triplets of Belleville and French animation in general for the visages of their many characters.  The restaurant critic was great, captured to sublime perfection, right down to the change of expression on his face when he sampled the Ratatouille.  A voice only Peter O'Toole could do. Janeane Garofalo was great as Colette as well.  But it was Remy who stole the show, a rat with a great nose for food, guided in his search for the ultimate cuisine by the ghost of the consumate chef, Gusteau.  Remy gave the young Linguini (Lou Romano) a decided advantage, while the hilarious Skinner (Ian Holm) smelled a rat in his kitchen.  Lou Romano seems to have found a home with Pixar.  The movie is great fun for everyone!</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Pixar and Disney have made a film that is truly visually appealing. In this movie we follow Remy the rat who has a unique nose for food. It is so sensitive that he can even detect when the food contains rat poison. His sense of smell leads him to a world of flavors and a love of great food. Though his family looks at any scraps as just energy to fuel the body, Remy has other ideas. So ignoring his father's advice he sets out to fulfill his dream of experiencing great food. Once he finds out he is actually living below Paris, he decides he must become a chef and fulfill his greater desire of creating great food. And it just so happens that he is living beneath the restaurant of his culinary hero, Augusted Gusteau. Remy quickly forms a bond with the garbage boy, Linguini. This leads to an adventure that has a story line that is worth watching. Like an old Disney movie we have a real storyline where we follow our little hero as he learns about what is important in life; family, friendship and striving to be the best you can at what ever you try. You also actually learn what it is like to work in a kitchen of a restaurant and the role that food critics play. This is a movie for those of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>RATATOUILLE is a Pixar picture.  That's all that one needs to know.  However, if you want some details about the film and some other (though highly unnecessary) reasons to watch the movie, keep reading.<br /><br />RATATOUILLE is a story about a French country bumpkin, named Remy (Patton Oswalt) who discovers that he not only has a nose and taste for fine food, but that he can cook great meals as well.  The only problem is that Remy is a rat.  Most people don't even like rats and since they carry and spread more diseases than almost any other animal in the world, it's not usually healthy to have one near a kitchen.  Remy finds himself literally swept away from the country to the streets of Paris.  He sneaks into the restaurant that is named and was once owned by a famous cook who Remy used to watch on tv and who believed that "anyone can cook".  Of course, no one actually believes that and after being caught, the kitchen's new scullery boy, Linguini (Lou Romano), is sent to drown Remy in the river.  Of course, Linguini can't bring himself to do it and when realizing that Remy can understand him and that he can cook, too, he brings Remy home.  A partnership is formed and the duo soon become the talk of Paris.  But the current chef and owner of the restaurant hates Linguini and smells a rat.  He tries to find out if there's someway he can keep the shining star from rising any higher, but his plans are nothing compared to the trouble that a deepening relationship between a rat and a man and the kindness that a rat shows towards his family.<br /><br />The film was written and co-directed by Brad Bird, a former animator of THE SIMPSONS and the guy who wrote and directed THE INCREDIBLES.<br /><br />You really shouldn't need any more reasons to see this movie, but I'll give you some more.  The film is mostly set in Paris and RATATOUILLE presents some of the most authentic animation of Paris ever seen on film.  If you've never been to Paris, you'll actually come away with a feel for the city after seeing the movie.  I know because I've never been to Paris and after the film some friends I know who have been there said, "Now you have an idea of what Paris is like."  Besides Patton Oswalt and Lou Romano, the movie also features the vocal talents of Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Will Arnett, and John Ratzenberger.<br /><br />Lastly, the other reason you should see RATATOUILLE is for the water animation sequence.  Remy is separated from his family and taken to Paris by the waterways in the streams and sewers that run from the countryside into the city.  I knew I was watching a cartoon during this sequence.  I kept telling myself that over and over and over. "This is animation."  The reason I did that is because the water looks so real.  It looked so real that there were times that it literally looks as if it is splashing off the screen.  Even if this wasn't a Pixar picture or had any of the other fine things going for it, RATATOUILLE would be worth seeing for that one sequence alone.<br /><br />Toddlers and younger kids will probably be enthralled with the colors.  Older children will probably love the physical comedy.  Adults will enjoy the story and the few allusions laid out for them throughout the picture.  RATATOUILLE truly is a picture for the whole family to enjoy and one of the best, if not the best animated film of 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>I've long been of two minds about Disney animated films -- they're often overwritten, sappy, and don't come even close to the fairy tales on which they claim to be based -- but this one is indeed very enjoyable, as shown by the Academy Award it won as best of the year. The story line is original, too: Remy is a French country boy with the makings of a great chef, but there's one big problem. He's a rat. Having found himself in Paris at the restaurant of his late hero, Chef Gusteau, Remy meets up with Linguini, the restaurant's new scullery lad, who has zero cooking talent. But by combining the rat's genius in the kitchen with the young man's human-ness (and his ability to be puppet-controlled by having his hair judiciously yanked beneath his toque), they set Paris on its ear and attract the attention of the city's greatest food critic, Anton Ego (the voice of Peter O'Toole). The characterizations are terrific, the dialogue is fun (especially Lou Romano as Linguini), and the humor is generally subtle. And, like nearly all successful "kid's films," it also has a lot for adults; my six-year-old granddaughter and I both enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Rats! That is what the folks at Pixar threw at us for the delightful "Ratatouille," the anti-Willard of kids movies. Filmed in a sweeping style (the visions of Paris after dark are almost dreamlike in their beauty), the story of Remy, the Rat who would be Chef, is the kind of Disney "can-do" movie that they've been making for years. But this is easily the best they've done since the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MAO46">Toy Story.</a><br /><br />Remy has to overcome his upbringing and his species after he gets separated from his clan. A series of events leads him to Linguini, kitchen help at a famous but downtrodden French Restaurant. From there, Remy and Linguini form an alliance and taste success. But they still have a big obstacle to overcome, food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole, "Ratatouille's" only celebrity voice-casting). How they manage to warm his heart and save the day is fun and funny, only leaning into mean-spiritedness once or twice. (Unnecessary French bashing, Remy's Dad seems too simple a character).<br /><br />The animation is way beyond average. Remy is fluid and lifelike...conveying more with a shrug or shimmy than most live critters (including two legged ones). His ride down the stream is breathtaking, as are the visions of Paris. (For Purists: there's a disclaimer at the end of the movie that 100% Animation - not motion capture, etc - was used to create "Ratatouille.") The story of being who you are despite what others expect is positive, even coming from a hoard of Rats. What they have in "Ratatouille" that gets a bit different is that there isn't any stunt casting, the cast doesn't suddenly break into song, and the language doesn't revert into cliche of the day. It just starts a good story and follows it though to a happy ending. One you can watch with anyone, any age, and likely, for repeat servings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Ratatouille is such a cute Disney/Pixar film.

This is certainly a good film that has its entertaining moments and is quite memorable; however, it's nothing groundbreaking and certainly not a film that's worthy of 5 star status.<br />Remy is a sewer rat who's told by his family and friends that he must live off scraps of any food he can find. His family and friends can live this way without a problem, but Remy has a problem, he has an excelled sense of smell which means he can't bare to try the scraps that he's taught he must eat to survive. Remy, against the wishes of his Father, Remy endeavours to find new flavours by smelling and mixing different foods, but to do this he must enter the humans territory. He constantly enters the home of an elderly woman to borrow some flavourings, On his numerous trips there he reads a recipe book by a nationally famous French Chef, Gusteau. Gusteau inspires Remy to keep trying new mixtures of flavourings and ingredients. During one of his regular trips to the humans home, Remy brings his brother along and the woman wakes up to spot the rats rummaging through her cupboards. She brings out a gun and starts shooting at them both, which leads to her ceiling collapsing revealing hundred of rats who have been living in her attic. While all the rats are running, Remy is left behind and goes the wrong way down a sewer which leads him to Paris, right outside Gusteau's restaurant.<br />Gusteau's restaurant is in trouble as due to a recent negative review from a really tough critic the restaurant is bumped from 5 stars down to 3 which leads to the death of Gusteau. Remy finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's fixing a soup that was accidentally ruined by the Garbage Boy Linguini who's the nephew of Gusteau. The soup becomes a success and Linguini takes the credit as the minute Remy was spotted he was taken away by Linguini to prevent him being killed. They form an unlikely bond that leads them down a slippery slope filled with comedy, love and revenge.<br /><br />Now, like I said this film is a pretty good movie but it's nowhere nears the greatness that it's been described as by many critics. To be honest it's the typical Disney plot line sugar coated in a new story and new characters; to some this may be fine and you may still enjoy the whole "facing tragedy we all come together and make it work" story, but quite frankly I'm finding it dull. Unlike others I didn't buy this right away as I knew what to expect, I knew I would only get a new storyline, but before I'd even bought it I had worked out the ending. I love the Disney/Pixar films and I'm a big fan of The Incredibles, Cars and Monsters Inc. But this film, I just didn't see the magic that I felt from the three aforementioned movies.<br /><br />My little niece watched this film with me, and naturally she loved it, but I felt robbed. I know it's a kids movie, but I still expected to like this film as much as I did the other 3 Disney/Pixar movies especially considering how good some of the reviews were.<br />If you're thinking of buying this for a young relative then I would highly recommend it, but if you're looking for an innocent film that's going to recapture the magic of any previous Disney/Pixar collaborations than this is something that you should stay away from</p></br><a href="../users/A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB.html">A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</a><br/><p>Ratatouille, from Pixar and Brad Bird (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009M9BK">The Iron Giant (Special Edition)</a>), is a rat's-eye view of the gastronomic delights of fine cuisine (the name itself is a pun on the classic French roast vegetable dish ratatouille). Remy is a young rat who discovers that he has a heightened sense of taste and smell, and becomes inspired by the late television chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), whose motto "anyone can cook" now extends to rats, too. Remy begins to experiment with combining classic combinations of flavor and texture, herbs, and other ingredients, until his clan is forced to flee their country safehouse.<br /><br />During the traumatic escape, Remy is separated from his family. The ghost of Chef Gusteau appears to Remy when he is discouraged, inspiring him to cook at Gusteau's formerly-five star restaurant. The acid restaurant critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) made it his personal mission to write a scathing review of Gusteau's that stripped it of one of its Michelin stars, consigning it to the tourist trade. Now, the restaurant is under the iron fist of the shady, domineering Head Chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Remy befriends the bumbling, couldn't-boil-water-if-his-life-depended-on-it Alfredo Linguini, whom Skinner grudgingly adopted as the new garbage boy, and Remy and Linguini team up to create culinary delights that astound the normally staid French restaurant critics. Remy controls Linguini by hiding under his chef's toque and tugging on two strands of hair (the scenes of Remy perfecting his technique with a blindfolded Linguini wielding dangerous tools and messy ingredients are priceless). Toss in a handful of intrigue, kitchen highjinks, father-son bonding, a dash of romance with the formidable chef Colette, and plenty of culinary delights, and you have Ratatouille.<br /><br />The 3D animation is photorealistic, and 360 shots of nighttime Paris entrance. Small touches really capture the Bohemian feel of the Montmartre district, and the soundtrack features (brief) snippets of La Marseillaise, light and airy French themes, and French-language vocals by Camille (the standalone soundtrack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PKG7HK">Ratatouille</a> is available for purchase). As with The Incredibles, there's lots to keep kids engaged (although the scene with the window full of dead rats might be traumatic for very young kids), and a whole other layer of adult humor bubbling under the surface, so mom and dad will be able to enjoy Ratatouille with gusto.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Wow.  For a Disney cartoon, this sure packs a lot of information into a short 90 minutes.  This is probably the most contemporary of all the Disney films to date with a plot semi-complex for some kids.  Adult will understand it a little more, but as always, Disney's attention to detail and the minutia in their animation is mind-blowing.  Pay particular attention to the cooking utensils and kitchen as well as the panoramic view of Paris.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>When "Ratatouille" (2007) was released last summer, I was not too eager to see an animated 106 minutes long film about a rat in a kitchen of a five-star Parisian restaurant. The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that "Ratatouille" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, "little chef" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. "Ratatouille" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: "How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it." Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw "Ratatouille" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a "grim eater", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.<br /><br />Not every year, an animated film is nominated for five Academy awards, and I wish "Ratatouille" victories in every category. It deserves them all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>A very cute, family friendly animated movie about a rat who loves to cook.

Director/writer Brad Bird has created a paean to the artistic impulses.  His story revolves around Remy the rat, who is blessed with a fine palate but cursed by being born, well, a rat.<br /><br />Look for plot summaries elsewhere.  Suffice it to say that Pixar's animation has never been better, and both the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant and the streets of Paris shine.  But the highlight of this film is its wonderful story, capped by a speech by food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) about the flaws of being a professional critic and the struggle to create.  O'Toole's speech should have every half-baked film critic second-guessing every review ever written, but gives hope to every struggling artist - including chefs.<br /><br />The movie's theme inspires me to try to pair it with another, like pairing a fine wine with the right food.  I'm not sure what movie would make a better pairing with "Ratatouille" - perhaps Stanley Tucci's "Big Night," or perhaps "Amelie," or perhaps "The Incredibles."  The possibilities are endless, but the result would always be deeply satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Ratatouille is a French dish of stewed vegetables that plays a delicious role in resolving the plot of this movie, thanks to a remarkable rat called Remy. Remy is a quintessential foodie. He raids shelves for saffron, picks fresh mushrooms, and watches his favorite chef on television, Auguste Gusteau, the deceased owner of the famous Parisian restaurant of the same name. But there's heat in that famous French kitchen after it's taken over by a new, very mean, owner after a bad review. Much to the horror of the new owner, Skinner, did Gusteau really leave the restaurant to his son and dish washer, Linguini? What will become of the romance between Linguini and the sous chef Collete? Will Remy ever reconcile with his family who can't understand why he's not satisfied to eat out of the garbage and serve them as their poison checker? Will the humans ever accept a rat in the kitchen? What will that imperious food critic, Anton Ego, think of Remy's dish of ratatouille? And just how will Remy, Collete and Linguini live happily ever after? Grab the family one Friday night, pop some popcorn, and tee up this great film to find out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>'Ratatouille' ranks, in my mind, as the best Pixar film since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>.  It's no surprise that writer-director Brad Bird, possessor of long-standing Disney roots, shaped and directed both of these masterpieces.  It's also thrilling to know that 'Ratatouille' earned not only the respect, but also the glowing admiration of both the French public and its gastronomic elite.  This is a movie that took the time to get the details right and present the French in their rightful role of world leaders in culinary achievements.  If you doubt that, watch the DVD extra with Thomas Keller (a consultant to the film) and note how all his career- and idea-forming experiences were all based in France or of French origin.<br /><br />'Ratatouille' is a movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  In fact, it seems - by a long stretch - to be the most adult-targeted of all Pixar's works to date.  For example, critic Anton Ego's pronouncements (fleshed out with an amazing voice characterization by Peter O'Toole) are something that would fly 100% over the head of your average eight-year-old.  The single best scene in the movie is when Ego tastes Remy's Ratatouille and is immediately transported into a warm reverie of his mother's similar dish.  That scene gave me goose bumps.  Fantastic stuff from Brad Bird and the whole Pixar team.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I had mixed feelings going into this movie.  On the one hand I had `The Incredibles' in memory, one of the finest cartoons ever made.  On the other I had `Cars' still in recent memory, one of the most overrated, over hyped pieces of cartoon garbage I had the horror of having to sit through.  Thankfully `Ratatouille' leans towards `The Incredibles', delivering one of the most refreshing and entertaining cartoon experiences in recent memory.  Cartoon's as of late have been on the dull side, none really jumping out and saying "I am the next classic, I am the movie your children and your children's children will love forever", until now.  Now, this isn't to say that `Ratatouille' is perfect, because in my opinion `The Incredibles' is a better all around film, but `Ratatouille' is the finest film to be released in cartoon form since it's glorious predecessor (I know, I really need to see `Persepolis', and I will eventually).<br /><br />`Ratatouille' revolves around Remy, a young rat who, unlike the rest of his pack, really cherishes food.  Sure, his fellow rats love to eat, but they'll eat anything.  Remy only wants the best food he can attain.  He's picky.  Living in France Remy has become fascinated with the famed chef Auguste Gusteau and is brokenhearted to hear that he has died suddenly upon receiving a scathing review by food critic Anton Ego.  Auguste firmly believed that anyone could cook and even wrote a book to that effect, a book that Remy would sneak out to read.  When an unfortunate event separates Remy from his family he finds himself in Paris with the most desirable of opportunities at his paws.<br /><br />Remy finds the late Gusteau's restaurant, now run by his sous-chef Skinner, a man who is as intolerable as he is feisty.  He is soon propositioned by a young garbage boy, Linguini, who, thanks to Remy, has been mistaken for a chef with talent and been promoted to the important position.  With Remy's talent and Linguini's human looks they pass off as the best chef Paris has ever seen, but a secret that Skinner is privy to leads him to work his hardest to thwart Linguini's progress.<br /><br />`Ratatouille' does a brilliant job of not only delivering state of the art animation (the movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at) but delivering a warm and touching story that gives real heart to these characters.  Remy's love for food, his passion and his determination to be himself despite the disapproval of those closest to him (namely his father) is admirable and teaches us the importance of fighting for what we believe in, for what we know is our destiny.  It also reigns forward with lessons on loyalty and humility, of honesty and compassion.  It teaches children and adults alike that these are admirable and commendable traits we all should strive to achieve.<br /><br />The voice talents enlisted here are superb, Patton Oswald delivering magnificently as Remy and Peter O'Toole truly stealing the show as the feared critic Anton Ego.<br /><br />With it's keen eye to detail, both in imagery and in story, `Ratatouille' proves itself deserving of all the praise that has been heaped upon it's sturdy shoulders and manages to be one of the only cartoons in recent years to be worthy of the Animated Feature Oscar.  Let's just say that if `Ratatouille' loses this year it'll be a crying shame, to know that the mediocre at best `Happy Feet' has an Oscar and this magical adventure does not.  Well, I have a feeling that this little rat will run full force to the podium this year to accept his very well deserved prize.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>It's not often that I say this, but absolutely everything about this film is fantastic. A great story -- a rat (eww!)  who has the talent and the ambition to be a great French chef. Great characters -- a kitchenful of chefs and sous-chefs, each with his or her own quickly-limned personality that is not just an easy caricature of the French. Janeane Garofalo was masterul as the voice of edgy Collette -- the lone female chef who would not be denied here place at the cookstove. Great messages -- 1) that there is such a thing as great cooking, 2) that it's hard but fulfilling to follow your dream and 3) that France is awesome! Add to this great writing, great voices that didn't get in the way of the story and INCREDIBLE animation, and you have the making of a phenomenon.<br /><br />The story of "Ratatouille" is simple -- a rat with an extremely well-developed sense of smell and taste desires to be a French cook. He teams up with the talenteless young son of a great French chef and -- voila! -- they team up to try to fool the most gastronomically picky audience on Earth. Along the way there are betrayals, chases (well, maybe one too many), a love story, a little wine, a little music and a lot of eye-popping visual art. There are scenes where the background is so beautifully rendered that a even a plain stone wall (albeit a Parisian one) is beautiful to watch. The animators expertly captured the sheen of wet rat fur, the swirl of drainage water and the whoosh of a gas flame. The kitchen is so lovingly rendered that after one viewing, you will have it mapped out for the rest of the film. Some scenes are fantastically staged -- as is the first scenes in which Remy, the main rat character, dispenses ingredient after ingredient into a soup. Every spice and vegetable makes it into the pot in a novel way -- whether tossed, dropped, sprinkled or somersaulted in. The planning and creativity that went into this 30-second snippet of film were astounding, and this sort of thing happens over and over. The ending was perfect, pulling victory from defeat in a way that was not bombastic (no one won the Nobel prize) but that nearly brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />"Ratatouille" may be too subtle for really little kids, but I think most 10-year-olds would enjoy it for more than its fast-paced antics. There's a lot to love about this film, and if you don't come away with a burning desire to visit Paris, then there may be no hope for you!</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I agree with the main statement of 'if you're able to get over your initial gag reflexes of rats cooking then this is the movie for you.'  I think I was doing good until climax of the film and there is literally hundreds or thousands of rats cooking and what not.  At that point, I couldn't stop shaking my head.  But as far as Remy and his non-cooking companion, I found the duo charming.  Pixar is the king of what they do and for that I will always be a returning viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Amazon reviews, the editorials, sometimes amaze me; What person is going to have a "Gag Reflex" after seeing animated rats?<br />This is an artfully done film, created in the Disney-esque tradition of making animals so lovable and anthropomorphic.The basic premise of the Rat who had culinary  ambitions is the leaping off point for many laughs and a great joy ride.<br />The DVD is well done, except that the extras that relate to the film somehow do not.The one extra you will laughing LOTS at is "LIFTED", this is a very good addition, and well worth the words of an extra.The material stated as extra which more closely relates to the film is<br />essentially a waste of time, and not worth a look out, certainly not entertaining like the feature and the extra LIFTED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>This is a sly, clever animation movie full of heart and intelligence.

I was there at the opening of "Toy Story" and I fell in love with their charming animation. Woody and Buzz, even the little game-machine alien, were just as evocative as any big-name actor--and a lot more fun.<br /><br />What I especially like about Pixar is they really do push the envelope. Think about it, they've made us come to care for bugs--and now a rat.  That's no mean feat.  I suspect Pixar's amazing talent could make a dungbeetle's antics hilarious and oddly appealing.<br /><br />The story in brief, Remy (Patton Oswalt's voice) is a rat with taste. He's watched a lot of cooking shows featuring his favorite, Chef Gusteau and he's even learned to read Gusteau's book, "Anyone Can Cook." He's hiding this information from his father, who has a different opinion.<br /><br />Remy gets tragically separated from his family colony and begins to see the ghost of Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett's voice) and the Chef gives him some very good advice:<br /><br />"If you're focused on what you've left behind, you will not be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up and look around!"<br /><br />Remy discovers he's in Paris, home of the best food in the world--at least, according to Parisians. And he's very close to Gusteau's restaurant.<br /><br />Surreptitiously, he enters the restaurant to find there's a new garbage boy, Linguini (Lou Romano's voice) spoiling the soup.  Remy cannot help but 'fix' the problem.  The soup's a hit and Linguini's got a promotion, the problem is Linguini really can't cook.<br /><br />So, Linguini and Remy team up.  Their communication and antics are hilarious.  Only the way, we encounter a hardbitten critic's critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole's voice) who ruined Gusteau's restaurant in the first place and indirectly caused his demise, Skinner (Ian Holm's voice) who now presides over the kitchen of Gusteau's and hopes to inherit the empire.<br /><br />The story's fun, and for the most part, predictable.  There is some wonderful French humor along the way too. "Ratatouille" was an interesting evening's viewing, but despite my Pixar Addiction, I doubt I will own this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>Pixar is amazing, not only does their animation blow away everyone else, the characters and plot lines are deeper and more compelling.

The story is touching as well, and that's what really counts: to be true to yourself and be what you're meant to be. The truly funniest parts are when Remy(the lead hero and main rodent) is learning to control Linguini(the clean-up boy of the restaurant) by means of pullng Linguini's hair. Way too funny!

This is a story about Remy, a young rat, living in the French countryside, who wants to be a famous chef.  Now who wants a rat in the kitchen?  Remy has high hopes and follows his dream. He watches a TV show, "Anyone Can Cook," that features his favorite chef.  Somehow he arrives in Paris, looking for the plump French Chef he saw on TV.  Remy is shocked to find that his amazing chef is dead. Remy has a wonderful memory for recipes and a "taste" for good food and knows how to make it.  Somehow, he and a clumsy new garbage boy get a job at a French restaurant.  Because people don't like rats in the kitchen, Remy controls the garbage boy while under his chef's hat.  He knows cooking and competes with the other chefs for the best meal.  The interactions and jealousy of the chefs and restaurant owner are a delight.<br /><br />Wonderful characters throughout, however, the restaurant critic is absolutely perfect!<br /><br />Many smiles and laughter, great artistry with animation, and the plot had many twists and turns.  The time went fast and an excellent film for all the family.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>The "but" in my headline is the main reason for me giving this movie 3 stars and not 4 or 5 as many have.  I think this latest Pixar film has some serious flaws.  For starters, this film isn't sure who its audience is.  Is it very young kids or older ones?  It isn't geared for teens or adults even though it is very intelligently written and has more of a storyline than others like it.  Disney had this same problem with "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" which kept wildly going back and forth between being a cutsey kids' film and one directed at more "mature" children; however, I did enjoy that film, but it performed less than expected by Disney's standards.<br /><br />My other serious issue with this film is the lack of good, consistent humor.  I, to be frank, found this film to be rather unfunny.  There are long stretches in this movie without any jokes or humor at all.  My youngest child (10) was getting very restless with the film and when the silly stuff came on then my older child (15) yawned and didn't even find the humor humorous (nor did I).  Again, there seems to be a serious lack of direction on this film.  Perhaps they attmepted to appease a too broad of an audience.  A noble but flawed intention with animated films.<br /><br />Another flaw is the lack of a quality soundtrack or score with this film.  It doesn't necessarily need some pop-stars with silly hip lyrics, but the music overall in this film was completely forgettable.  I serious drawback, in my view, for a kid's film.  Heck, I love the soundtrack to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R99F">A Goofy Movie</a> and that was totally directed at young children.<br /><br />On the up side of things the animation is truly outstanding (you can almost count the hairs on the rats for crying out loud).  The script is intelligent, offers a mild, digestible message, and is, overall, rather mature in tone and topic (which shoots over the heads of many little ones).  Finally, the voices are top-notch by all involved.  A special Oscar should go to Peter O'Toole's performance as the self-serving food critic.  In fact, I think it's time we had an additional category for voiceovers in animated features at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />Well, I know I will get ripped for this review as it's hard to criticize a family film without offending someone, but this is my position on this over-rated film, but still somewhat enjoyable summer flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Rats have always been associated with filth: they live in sewers; they eat out of the garbage; they've probably been exposed to a disease. Is it any wonder that we cringe at the thought of a rat touching the food we eat? One of the things that makes Disney/Pixar's "Ratatouille" so interesting is that this idea is intentionally turned on its head: it's about a rat with a passion for food and a talent for cooking. This story is told with charm, style, and a generous dose of humor, made even better through wonderful animation and decent voice work. I won't go so far as to say that this is the greatest Disney/Pixar film ever made, but I will say that--like all that have come before it--it's a well made film that's a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />This film cleverly breaks a clear distinction between humans and non-humans, the kind that was first demonstrated in "Toy Story." In that film, the toys' cardinal rule was to never let a human see them walk and talk. Humans have come to believe that toys are inanimate objects; they will never be able to accept anything different. "Ratatouille" opens with the same basic principle: a rat can never interact with a human. Humans think that rats are dirty, vile creatures; they will never think otherwise. Or would they? The story centers on the unlikely relationship between a rat--Remy (Patton Oswalt)--and a human--Linguini (Lou Romano)--a relationship that clearly violates the rules of species interaction. Both characters are motivated by the desire to prove something.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place in the kitchen of a troubled Parisian restaurant that was once worthy of five stars. This is where Remy winds up after being separated from his clan (the end result of a trigger-happy old woman ridding her house of vermin). This is dream come true for the little rat; Remy has always appreciated food, from the smells to the flavors to the various combinations of ingredients. He was born to be a chef. While trying to escape from the kitchen, he gets distracted by a pot of soup in desperate need of assistance. As he adds the final ingredient, he's caught by Linguini, a stumbling, bumbling wreck recently hired as a garbage collector. While he's able to prevent Remy from being seen, he's too late to prevent the soup from being served. But to everyone's surprise, the soup is a big hit with the customers.<br /><br />Later that night, when alone, Remy and Linguini discover that they can communicate with each other. This is good news for Linguini; the restaurant staff believed that he cooked the wonderful soup, and the head chef--the tiny, high-strung, power-hungry Skinner (Ian Holm)--wants him to cook it again the next day. This is when Linguini and Remy form a secret partnership: Remy will be the brains behind the recipes, and Linguini will physically cook the meals.<br /><br />This sets into motion the more comedic portions of the film, portions highlighted by Remy's literal puppetry of Linguini. While hiding underneath a toque, Remy is able to manipulate Linguini's arms by pulling locks of his hair. I don't think I fully appreciated the slapstick nature of these scenes; hidden beneath the talking animals and formulaic plot is a story that's more mature. I greatly appreciated the themes of friendship and cooperation, and I certainly enjoyed the developing relationship between Linguini and the aggressive yet vulnerable Colette (Janeane Garofalo). But when it comes to the comical results of Remy's puppetry, something was lacking. Maybe it was the fact that Linguini had already been established as a funny character. Nothing further was needed.<br /><br />But that's my only real criticism of "Ratatouille." The rest of the film is pleasing and light, as is expected of all family-oriented animated films. Some of the best moments involve Remy's conversations with the imaginary spirit of Gusteau (Brad Garrett), a world-class chef and founder of the restaurant. He appears whenever Remy needs a pep talk, specifically when it comes to the assertion that anyone can be a cook if he or she is in the right mindset. This character acts as a counterpoint to Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), who's always unsupportive and unsatisfied. He would prefer to see his son eat garbage and avoid human contact like every other rat. But Remy is independent, and he's determined to show his father that (a) not all humans are bad, and (b) that he can make something of himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, doing so will mean having to work with Linguini, who's now letting the restaurant's success go to his head. Making matters even worse is Skinner; not only does he suspect Remy's involvement, he also panics at the prospect of Linguini taking ownership of the restaurant (for reasons I won't reveal). The biggest obstacle for all the characters is food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), a sinister and somehow ghoulish old man. Many years ago, he wrote a scathing review of the restaurant, forcing it to drop one of its stars (another was dropped when Gusteau died). The restaurant's recent rise in popularity has come to his attention, as has the publicity surrounding Linguini. Using every mannerism of a horror movie villain, Ego personally challenges Linguini to prepare a dish worthy of a good review.<br /><br />Thus, the groundwork is laid for the film's ending, which is just as amusing as it is far fetched. But plausibility doesn't even come into play here; this is a fun-filled animated film, perfect for children and generally well suited for adults. No one will care that a language barrier between French and English was completely ignored. No one will mind that only certain characters speak with a French accent. "Ratatouille" was appropriately crafted so that Remy, Linguini, and their fateful partnership will be all anyone cares about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>My experience with rats in movies is generally not positive.  There were the killer rats in "Ben" and "Willard," the over-sized rats in "Food of the Gods," and the mega-rats in "Graveyard Shift."  Even though "Ratatouille" had a lot of positive press well before I purchased this movie, I must confess to being apprehensive.  My apprehension was (mostly) unfounded.<br /><br />Remy is an unusual mouse in that he likes to watch the cooking shows of the famous chef, Gusteau.  Remy also has an excellent nose, which his family puts to use to detect poisonous food.  Of course, Remy just wants to cook.  A farmer's wife discovers Remy during one of his sojourns into a farmhouse kitchen.  Remy's discovery soon leads to the discovery of his family and a hasty departure from the farm.<br /><br />After a harrowing journey, Remy ends up in Paris.  Remy soon finds his way to Gusteau's restaurant where he joins forces with Linguini, who is inept in just about everything he does, except for being Remy's hands.  Soon Linguini impresses everyone with his cooking ability, except for Chef Skinner, who planned on capitalizing on Gusteau's name by franchising it.  Linguini's apparent abilities make the restaurant famous again, until the local health inspector discovers rats in the kitchen.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was very creative.  I would never have thought of putting a rat into a restaurant as a chef.  I also thought having a rat control the actions of a human was an interesting twist on the usual role of rats in movies.  I laughed out loud in several places while watching this movie.  Some of the jokes were hilarious.  Other jokes were a little flat.  I also think there were some insider jokes, which were lost on me.  I liked the characters of Remy, Collette (wonderfully voiced by Jeneane Garofalo), Chef Skinner and most especially Anton Ego (extremely well voiced by Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />With all that I liked about this movie, I had a couple of issues, one structural and one personal.<br /><br />The structural issue is that the movie, which is pushing two hours in length, has some slow spots.  I found myself looking at the display on the DVD player to see how long the movie had been on.  I only do that when a movie fails to hold my interest.<br /><br />The personal problem I had was the scene with the rats in the restaurant.  It was bad enough when Remy was sitting on Linguini's hand, and then Linguini was handling food (ewwww), but to see all those rats in the restaurant all over the food preparation surfaces got to me.  Sorry, but that scene was yucky.<br /><br />This release has a nice share of extras.  The two best extras are the shorts, "Lifted," which is very funny, and "Your Friend the Rat," which is pretty good but not quite as funny as "Lifted."  There are deleted scenes that fans of the movie will enjoy, though they are still close to the storyboard stage.  There is another feature called "Fine Food and Film," which suggests some of the inspiration for the movie.  This movie also has a bunch of Easter eggs in it, but other web sites have already covered those well, so I will not repeat them here.<br /><br />If you like animation, especially Pixar's, then you will probably like "Ratatouille."  The characters are sympathetic and fun, and the humor is as well.  The only troubling scene is one involving food preparation in a restaurant and hundreds of mice.  Children will doubtless have little problem with the thought of rodents scampering over the scallions, or rats romping in the risotto.  That scene still makes me queasy.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I went to the theater to see this animated tale of a cleaver rodent who dreams of being a chef. The story is well written and seemed geared more for adults,kids should enjoy it too. The animation is incredible and some great voice work by Oswalt and company. I wrote this review after seeing this film in theaters and I am adding some comments about the DVD release.<br />The DVD has an excellent transfer but, the extras are a little thin for such an interesting film. I smell a 2 disc in the future which is bound to "tick off" consumers. There are two very good shorts on the DVD release to save this release from being rather "bare boned".</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>If you love quality films and think Pixar is leading the industry in innovation and storytelling, you owe it to yourself to see "Ratatouille." Pixar will only maintain creative control over its product so long as they are earning money for Disney. Unlike its predecessors Cars, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Monsters, Inc., Ratatouille failed to earn even $50 million in its opening weekend. A lot of money, yes, but not a good sign for the investors.<br /><br />Money aside, Pixar has proved once again that they can do what no one else can: create fully realized CG worlds that are only secondary to the story being told. The CG here is simply marvelous. Paris comes to life, the food is so realistic you want to reach out and eat it, and the rats move with a delicate grace that is at the same time cartoonish and believable. But what truly sets Pixar apart from every other animation studio is that they can walk that line between animated reality and cartoon absurdity. The key, here, is the people that inhabit the worlds they've created. They don't look remotely realistic. They look, in fact, much like the humans in The Incredibles. Overlarge heads, exaggerated limbs, and a fluidity of movement that can only be recreated in a movie. Unlike Shrek, or Ice Age, or any other CG movie, Ratatouille allows it's humans be to be cartoons, but they surround them with the most realistic world imaginable. This effect isn't disconcerting, it frees the viewer to sit back and simply absorb everything.<br /><br />Like their previous efforts, the story is everything. Remy is a rat who loves to cook and he befriends a young man who can't cook, but works in the kitchen of a famous restaurant. The story is both hilarious and exciting. It never falls into melodramatic traps, and the characters act in believable ways - they don't simply do what the writers think they should do to advance the plot to a happy conclusion.<br /><br />In short, this is not a formulaic film. It balances ingenuity, wit, and skill, and produces one of the finest films in it's category. I don't know if this is the best Pixar film yet, but it's at least the equal of Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. In fifty years, we'll all be looking back on Pixar as the finest example of a creative force in Hollywood. Let's hope Disney allows them to continue making films their way.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the family and I have no problem with "Ratatouille". And I can find fault with just about every movie I see.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>Ratatouille is a wonderful film about discovering who you are and follow your dreams no matter where you come from. As with every Pixar production, the animation is superb, the characters are compelling and the story resound with everyone. Also, the humor is great.<br /><br />Remy is a rat that dreams to become a chef and his opportunity comes when he meets Linguini, a garbage boy who wants to keep his job. Together, they become the finest chef in France but problems arise in the restaurant and with Remy's family that can jeopardize the whole scheme. I have to say that the best character is Linguini, it's obvious that the animators had a blast animating him because it's so funny and all his mannerisms are executed spectacularly. Themes like family, friendship, passion and more are the core of the film and everything is enveloped in a beautiful score by the great Michael Giacchino. The animation is a sight to behold. Paris looks so beautifully breathtaking and the food looks so deliciously real that you will get real hungry while watching the film. Ratatouille is Pixar's 8th triumph and one they should be very proud about. A wonderful film.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />Ratatouille comes to BD looking absolutely fantastic. This is hardly a surprise being a Pixar film but still the transfer mesmerize. Colors jump off the screen, detail and contrast are terrific and no compression artifacts whatsoever. Simply amazing.<br /><br />The 5.1 uncompressed audio is also amazing with fidelity and clarity beyond your expectations. Spectacular.<br /><br />Bonus Material:<br />Ratatouille comes with a nice assortment of bonus features although is not as loaded as other Pixar films. First you have a documentary "Fine food and Film" which is a conversation with director Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller. It's a fantastic piece where you learn how they chose their careers and how passionate they are about it. You have two great shorts "Lifted" and "Your Friend the Rat". You also have making of featurettes that deals with all the aspects of the production of the film including story, characters, music, design and more. You also have a gallery, a game, publicity material and deleted scenes.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also included.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />Ratatouille is another Pixar Triumph that everyone should see and own. This BD is great with terrific Video & Audio quality and many hours of bonus material and comes Highly Recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great French chef despite his family's wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.

He teams up with Linguini, an awkward young man who is an aspiring chef. Together they are able to bring Remy's culinary visions to the (human) public. The unconventional duo must fight through adversity that is more than just what would happen if people found out that not only is there a rat in the kitchen, but that rat just prepared their dinner.<br /><br />I liked this movie. It wasn't my favorite Pixar movie, but I certainly enjoyed the creativity. And it looked great, as the Pixar movies all do. The story was a little weak on its own, and I feel that I enjoyed it a little more on a personal level than others might. If you don't enjoy being in the kitchen, you might miss some of the charm, I feel, was present in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Disney comes up with another clever story. The graphics are incredible and the story delightful. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could. Although not "The Lion King" caliber, it is quite good. This may cause some cringes as most people associate rats with filth and disease. The thought of a rat touching your food isnt exactly mouth watering.<br /><br />A rat follows a TV show put on by a French chef and begins to experiament in changing his garbage fare into something more delectable.

Good quality DVD with great replayability.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I think this film is a tad overrated, but it's negatives are with the story and dialogue primarily.  I still enjoyed the film very much.  I've always liked most of what Pixar has done (which may surprise some of my friends here), and this film is a good addition to their catalogue.  There were a few problems, though.  I felt there was too much expository information, especially at the beginning.  Much of the dialogue (and situations) were very predictable, including the usual "the French are rude" stuff.  I didn't buy the romance between Colette and Linguini.  It felt forced, and didn't seem like it would really happen, in movie life or in real life.  The repartee between the rats seemed forced, too.<br /><br />On the good side, the film is visually immaculate.  Brad Bird does a tremendous job here, and he has a great sense of composition.  I wish I had seen it in a theater.  The animation is positively gorgeous.  The voices are very well done for the most part, and my favorite characters are Peter O'Toole's Anton Ego (great name) the critic, and Gusteau, voiced by Brad Garrett.  Many made hay of Janeane Garofalo's French accent for Colette, but I feel Garrett's is much, much better.  Garofalo's accent, while good, had a few dropouts here and there where her real voice came through.  This is not entirely her fault, as they changed her character to one with a French accent late in the production, and she did the best she could on such short notice.  Many were surprised that Garofalo managed to do an accent pretty well.  I'm not.  I've always believed in her talent.  Patton Oswalt (best known for his recurring role in The King of Queens, and one of the funnier standup comedians today) is fine as Remy, the rat who can cook.  The film has a real nice wrap up too, incorporating Gusteau's phrase that "anyone can cook", and Peter O'Toole's final speech in the film is surprisingly moving and stirring.  So, people should definitely rent this film.  It's not perfect, but it is still head and shoulders above most dreck at theaters these days....</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>Delectably fantastic is the way I would describe Pixar's RATATOUILLE;just the perfect blend of ingredients to make an informative film on the art of cooking that is both savoury and sweet for adults and enough action and cuteness for the kids (kids that do not get bored easily and have a bit of "je ne sais quoi" that is either inborn or taught by some diligent and progressive parents!).Having run a dining facility for nine years now, I found that RATATOUILLE served up a deliciously adult entree of informative cooking tips and cooking terms that we teach at our restaurant.The information about how a kitchen is run and the personel hierarchy is spot-on.We try to always create "the new" knowing that the patrons and the critics are always "on the prowl" to catch us on an off day! So,I had NO problems at all with the total enjoyability of this very clever film.I found it far more illuminating than EMERIL and JULIA CHILDS! The fact that a rat named Remy (named after Remy Martin I presume) is the chief-artiste made this rollicking good film all the more delightful.The French accents, the cooking terms, the problem with patrons and critics are all very adult themes, and I saw children around me squirming and laughing occasionally.The adults,though, roared and had a good time and I wondered," Did Pixar just trick we adults into seeing a film aimed primarily at us?" Well, if they did then it worked for me.I loved every last bite,every last morsel and I belched with approval after the dessert!</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>I saw this a couple of months ago in the States and was blown away.  I had wanted to see this ever since publicity started up for it on shows like ET or The Insider.  I wasn't disappointed.  It was everything I thought it would be and more.  Side splitting in parts and brilliant 'animation'.  Now that it has FINALLY got to Australia (months and months later) I am heading off to see it again because it's so good.<br />The story line keeps you engaged the whole time even though the thought of rats in a kitchen may not seem appealing or appetising.  It's set in Paris and the scenery is very realistic and beautiful.<br />Remy is well voiced by Payton Oswalt (King of Queens and Reno 911) and I thought Django was done brilliantly by Brian Dennehy.  Remy comes to Paris from the French countryside to find his cooking idol is dead.  He makes friends with a restaurants garbage boy and so the fun begins.  Overall this is such a cute, adorable and cleverly written movie that will have you laughing your head off and keep you very well entertained.

Not that he does anything completely left of center but they somehow feel different in spirit than the studio's regular output with the "Incredibles" being my favorite film they've done. Now comes "Ratatouille", Bird's follow-up to that superhero movie and Pixar's followup to the uncharacteristically-average "Cars". Since that film wasn't that well received, Ratatouille didn't look promising either until it became, deservingly, one of the best-reviewed films of the year.<br /><br />Remy is a rat living in the French countryside with his family living off of garbage. But with a gift for smell and taste, Remy has more higher standards for the kind of food he eats. But when he's seperated from his family and finds himself under Paris' restaurant, Gusteau's, home of Remy's idol and with the motto "anyone can cook!", Remy feels right at home. That is of course if people can accept a rat in the kitchen, much less cooking their food. But with the help of socially inept and cooking-challenged Linguini, Remy and Linguini become friends and kitchen stars which attracts the attention of ambitious chef Skinner and harsh food critic Anton Ego.<br /><br />Whereas the Incredibles was more action-packed than any other Pixar outing, Ratatouille almost has a more romantic comedy/buddy movie feel and it feels more unique than A Bug's Life or Finding Nemo. There isn't that one obvious comic relief character and the film doesn't end in a glorious action sequence so while the kids might find it too character-driven, adults might find it more delightful that the film speaks to the audience and not down at them with bad puns and pop culture references. From colorful characters and a lighthearted but not saccharine tone, the film seems quite at home with anyone.<br /><br />It's kind of a cliche now to point out Pixar has become the best in computer animation. Whereas Dreamworks and the folks behind Robots and Ice Age do have impressive animation, at times there's things such as texture or subtleties that make them far behind. And it's fair to say Ratatouille is probably their most accomplished and it's all to do with character animation and nuances. Sure there's things like the slightly translucent flesh tone that the rat's ear has to the differences between wet fur, dry fur and whatnot but the characters feel more realistic. One of my favorite parts is when a character is about to slap another but stops and it's just as good an acting job as live-action. Then of course there's the food. Don't watch on an empty stomach.<br /><br />If there's one knock, it's the special features. While they have double-dipped in the past, Monsters Inc. to the Incredibles were always filled with featurettes and documentaries about the making-of. But since Cars, the films seem light on anything. Sure we get the funny short "Lifted", a new short and whatnot but it's not as packed as I would like it to be. There's not even a commentary and as anyone who's heard Bird talk, he's a very...animated fellow (no pun intended) and to hear him talk about the film would've been welcome.<br /><br />It might not have the wide-reaching appeal Toy Story has but for anyone looking for a great animated film, can't go wrong with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Ratatouille (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) is an amazing animated movie from the Walt Disney Pictures.

The film's story is cute and uplifting, without being totally predictable.  Remy is fine protagonist, he is likeable, albeit not exactly cuddly, but you root for him the entire way.  I really didnt like the boy that play's his human friend, if you can call him that.  I was surprised at how much I dislike him and even at the end, I was not pleased to see things had turned out well for him, odd for a movie of this kind.  One odd thing, that really bothered me was how very few of these supposed "French" characters, bothered with actually having French accents.  The hero is a French rat, with a sort of generic American accent, it seemed so bizarre.  Overall, a very good movie with fantastic animation, not as good as the perfect, Incredible's, but close.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>This film was good.

The hordes of rats sort of freaked out my wife and while the movie went to great lengths to assure the audience that the rats were clean and sanitary the fact is when they raided the pantry they didn't wash their hands and did in fact contaminate the food which was later used. Thankfully the Health Department closed the place down.  Of course this is only a cartoon and shouldn't be taken too seriously.  As a cartoon it was well executed and undoubtedly appealed to its target audience.  This wasn't one of Disney's best efforts but when compared to what is generally being offered to kids on TV it is outstanding.  A cute movie, kids will love it, predictable and a little unnerving if not downright spooky at times.  Unless you have kids I think I would miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I loved Meet the Robinsons and think it was an under-rated film. I didn't think it could get more charming and fun than that but Ratatouille proved me wrong. It's about a rat who has a scent for what's good food and what's bad food. His father just wants him to use that gift to make sure the clang aren't eating poisoned food. When the clang has to relocate he loses them but he can live with that since he find's his favorite late chef's restuarant. The restuarant isn't the same without the chef but the rat's taste for what makes good food could be enough to turn it back into a 5 Star Restuarant. Only an untalented new chef knows that it's actually the rat who's the talented new chef.<br /><br />  The result is a charming appretising film that has the style of an old fashioned Disney movie. It has as good of a story as the traditional animated Disney films that they don't make anymore. Plus it has of a good of a lesson as the older films do as well. Although I also like the "keep moving forward" lesson that we get from Meet the Robinsons. This movie is about following your dreams without letting anything get in the way. Plus it's also great to look at. Paris looks so great here that it makes you feel like you're there or wish you were there. The food looks great too and I had to go cook something right when I got home after seeing the movie. I strongly recommend this film to anyone, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy Ratatouille.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Ratatouille is an absolutely wonderful treat, both in animation and in its storyline. Talk about a delicious way to spend hours! Not everyone can do animation, but as this latest movie proves. Pixar can do it well every time.  The flair is French, the story is about a rat, but don't let it fool you - this is the perfect movie for everyone, for all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>I was a little apprehensive about watching a movie about a rat who likes to cook.  However, two things got me interested in it.  The first was the director, Brad Bird, who wrote, directed, voiced, and probably did make-up for "The Incredibles"... what I believe is one of the greatest animations of all time.  What clenched it for me was a review by somebody who's opinion I trust.<br /><br />First, we were treated by the usual Pixar short animation before the movie.  Oh, how I love these.  They are cute, short, hilarious, and often unpredictable.  The one preceding this movie was no exception.<br /><br />We were then treated to the movie.<br /><br />You first get to know Remy (the rat that everybody sees in the advertising) and his family.  He isn't happy with his life because he does not get to do the one thing that he wants to do the most... cook.  But when his rat colony needs to move suddenly he loses contact with his loved ones but finds himself in Paris and meets Linguini, an employee at a restaurant who couldn't properly make a batch of ice if requested.  The problem with being a rat is that you aren't openly welcomed in anybody's kitchen.  However, after a series of interesting events, Remy and Linguini team up to become the cooking sensation of Paris.<br /><br />Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />The story is good and it works.  I like the message, which is basically to not judge a book by its cover.  The characters grow and we end up really interested on how everybody turns out.  Like other Pixar movies, it had everything you could wish for in a movie.  If you like other Pixar movies, there is little reason to not pick this movie up.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Three reasons.<br /><br />The first is my OCD rearing its head.... there was a freaking RAT in the KITCHEN touching all the FOOD!!!  Sorry, I just could not get over that.  I'd probably be more accepting of a cat, dog, or otter... but a rat?  One of the most diseased animals ever?  Did the writers ever hear of a little event knows as the GREAT PLAGUE??!?!  But, that is just me.  I know, I know... he washes his hands, but still.<br /><br />The second is the mechanism that Remy and Linguini come up with so they could cook together.  This was more unbelievable than talking and cooking mice.  I guess it would have been more difficult to come up with something else but with Brad Bird's genius I think he just came up with something easy instead of clever.<br /><br />Lastly, this was in Paris.  There should have been a LOT more France jokes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'Ratatouille' brings a distinctively different animated menu.  Straight from Pixar/Disney entertainment, we get a fun, freewheeling adventure that is always witty, fresh, and funny.<br /><br />Our hero is Remy (Patton Oswalt) a rat with a lot on his plate.  Survival is his family's primary purpose in life, but Remy doesn't want just to survive, he wants to live.  Having a particularly astute olfactory sense, he disdains the garbage dump for a tastier venue.  When he and his community are evicted from their peasant woman's place, it's a narrow escape at best. Remy is separated from the rest, so he ventures off to see the sights of Paris.  There he happens upon Gusteau's 5-star restaurant, a place where the owner inspires everyone, "That anyone can cook".  Gusteau dies of heartache after his place is demoted to 4-star status by critic nemesis Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) known as "The Grim Eater".  Once inside he keeps a low-profile until he comes upon newly hired hand Linguini (Lou Romano) who hands his letter of recommendation from Gusteau's widow to Skinner, the manager.  Skinner is a low-down greedy type who lends the Gusteau name to less haute frozen food cuisine.  In his repertoire are recipes for sabotage and a detective to find Linguini's true heritage to prevent him becoming the restaurant's heir.  Reme' elevates Linguini's cuisine skills with distinctive communication they keep under his hat.  Besides a hostile critic and manager, Linguini faces Collette, a beautiful fellow cook who must bear all the talent but none of the stature of men.<br /><br />'Ratatouille' is thoroughly delightful.  The plot is seasoned with imaginative ingredients that never falter for entertainment.  The peril is creative, and the story is marinated to perfection.  With such a clever and witty script (written by five writers, no less) the pace and execution is suitable for every palate.  It is hard to imagine a better family entertainment for 2007.  'Ratatouille' is the animated film to top.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Although I didn't find Ratatouille as funny as most of the other Pixar films, the story is what sold me. I just loved the way the whole movie came together. Setting it in Paris, France was just a sight to behold. The animation looked great and the characters were memorable.<br /><br />I don't know if Pixar is capable of making a film that critics and audiences dislike. This kind of film really puts Shrek the Third to shame.<br /><br />Now off to the pet store to get my own pet rat.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Twenty minutes in the little kids were done. The artwork was incredible, the story not. There may have been two small laughs. Not enough to buy the DVD or watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>There is no question that this story works:  a rat who doesn't quite fit in must make his own way, so he tries to do what he really loves, i.e. gourmet cooking.  The rat stumbles onto a situation, where a bumbling man boy (also someone who doesn't fit in) is trying to get work in a restaurant, and helps him to appear as if he were a chef of genius.  Once the boy understands the rat's talent, it makes for some pretty funny role playing to keep the secret.  The man boy meets a girl, begins to make his fortune, etc.  Then, there is an imbroglio, including a dustup with a vindictive resto critic, throwing everything into jeopardy.  This is pretty formulaic stuff and the happy ending is predictable.<br /><br />That being said, the film does do a great job regarding the themes of conformity, surprising talents, and the need to throw away one's prejudices.  It is very well done, and amidst the antics my son was moved by it, too.  Recommended, though given Disney's pricing policies, we probably won't buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Remy the Rat, unlike his brother, father, and extended family, refuses to eat just anything that he finds lying around.  He is a gourmand - sneaking into a human's kitchen to read her cookbooks, trying various mushrooms to try and find the best match to his cheese, etc.  When he ends up in Paris, he finds Gusteau's restaurant in a declining state - savaged by the critic Ego, with a head chef more interested in developing microwave burritoes than in cooking fine food.<br /><br />The biggest hurdle to enjoying this film, as mentioned in the Amazon description, is the fact that this movie is about rats.  Hundreds of them in some scenes.  Ironically, it's the success of the advances in computer animation that makes it difficult - these are not the rodents of "The Rescuers".  They are much more realistic and even I, who have no particular aversion to rats, was a little creeped out by the hyper-realism of Remy's rippling fur.<br /><br />Ultimately the story comes down to the conflict between Remy (and his human avatar Linguini) and the critic Ego.  The resolution of this conflict is so surprisingly satisfying and effective that it redeems the entire film, which is otherwise not particularly original.<br /><br />I can also report that this film works well for children.  Although too dialogue-heavy for really young children, my son inserted the film into his regular rotation starting about age 4.  It's not requested as much as Cars (obviously!) but it's certainly watched more often than Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., or Aladdin.<br /><br />This DVD has a couple of really good extras - the short "Lifted" (which, again, my 4-year-old loves) and the promo short "Your Friend the Rat".  But these two short films - grand total of maybe 15 minutes - is the sum total of all the extras.  There are no making-of featurettes, no director's commentary, etc.  For children, I'm sure they don't care.  For animation/Disney afficionados, this is disappointing to say the least, especially considering that Pixar commentaries are usually very entertaining and informative.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>This is a highly entertaining children's film.  A bit scary in the beginning for super young kids.  Got to say though struggled with the whole RAT thing.  Never quite could wrap my head around that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>Pixar continues the tradition of defining the creative and technical standards of feature-length computer animated motion pictures that it started with "Toy Story" back in 1995. What makes this film unique, like all Pixar movies, is that technical detail is used to accentuate a great comic script with heart. I would say other computer animated movies do the reverse, but then I would be saying that they have great scripts with heart, which they generally don't. Like all Pixar films there is something here for the whole family, the kids can enjoy it for the shear comic spectacle, such as when Remy the rat discovers he can control the boy Linguini like a marionette by pulling hairs under his hat and thus cook meals via remote control, and the adults can enjoy the comedy plus the irony of a rat who dreams of preparing fine food and how sometimes your own personal dreams can clash with family loyalty and society's expectations. Highly recommended. Extra features include:<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - With introductions by Ratatouille's acclaimed screenwriter/director Brad Bird.<br /><br />"Your Friend the Rat" - Remy and Emile star in an all-new animated short film.<br /><br />Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller - Cuisine and cinema come together in this behind the scenes look at how master chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller brought his real life expertise to the table.<br /><br />Lifted - In Pixar's latest short, Oscar nominated for Best Animated Short Film, a teen alien learns that failure is an option.<br /><br />Note that Pixar has been making great animated short films since ten years before the release of "Toy Story" and that a collection of 13 of their animated shorts dating back to their first in 1984 is due to be released on DVD the same day as this film. The only drawback is that "The Pixar Short Films Collection" will contain "Lifted", which is also on this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Ratatouille" is Pixar's greatest accomplishment to date, which is saying a heck of a lot considering that this is the same brilliant company responsible for films like "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo" and "The Incredibles."<br /><br />The movie is set in Paris, where some of the world's most famous chefs have launched their careers. Remy, a very likeable rat, has a gourmet nose and amazing culinary skills. Sadly, his dreams of becoming a chef seem pretty farfetched due to the limitations of his species. However, Remy eventually teams up with Linguini, a gangly young man who lands a job as a garbage boy in one of the most famous restaurants in Paris. Linguini is quite possibly the worst cook ever, but he and Remy devise a method of working together in the kitchen: Remy hides under Linguini's white chef's hat and tugs on the boy's hair to give him commands. As a result, Linguini quickly becomes one of the most sought-after cooks in all of Paris, with a lot of help from his "little chef."<br /><br />Even though this is a Pixar/Disney film, there's something about it that reminds me of the classic animated cartoons from many, many years ago (you know, when Disney cartoons were actually good). "Ratatouille" is visually stunning and a joy to watch. The characters appear to be three-dimensional, and the beautiful Parisian scenery is a great background throughout the film. There are so many amazing characters in this movie, too: scruffy and adorable Remy, bumbling Linguini, sassy Colette, and Skinner (my personal favorite), an angry little man who reminds me of a non-monkey version of Mojo Jojo from "The Powerpuff Girls."<br /><br />I loved, loved, LOVED this movie! It's a very solid story that's chock full of smart humor, colorful characters, and lots of action and excitement. This is a movie that kids and adults will enjoy very much. I plan to go see it again in the theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 5.0<br /><br />Prior to viewing this movie, I hadn't seen any Disney/Pixar films since Toy Story. I know, I'm out of the loop, but thank goodness I found this gem in Ratatouille. Never had I been so brought back to the joys of childhood where I could watch a movie and have it bring about so many forms of sheer joy and innocent emotion and feel like I actually was a kid again. But at the same time, I found a very subtle maturity to the story and characters of this movie as well. The amazement of cooking and food, the exotic backdrop of Paris, the silly, yet serious interactions of a rat and his handler, then the denouement of a hard-nosed food critic who rediscovered himself and reasserted the happiness of which only food can do to a person; all of these elements make for a very light-hearted comedy about what it means to find something in life that you can dedicate yourself to, pursue, and enjoy to your heart's content. In particular, I was every impressed with the script and screenplay. Remy's conscience being played by an imaginary version of Gusteau was brilliant in studying his overall character as the audience gets a clear, basic understanding of what Remy is thinking to himself. Linguini is a "lovable loser" archetype that tries so hard, but always manages to bumble things. There's a sort of coyness that makes him fun to root for and his "ambitions" are commendable, kind of like an "everyman," so I really enjoyed watching him as well. Then, there are all of the other supporting characters in Chef Skinner, Anton Ego, Collette, Remy's family, etc. that ultimately make the film one very enjoyable experience. Top that off with a great soundtrack by Michael Giacchino who captures much of the same exoticism that makes Paris so intriguing, and you've got this lovely Oscar-wining feature.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Being a direct digital transfer of CG to BD, the result is flawless. Colors are vibrant with lots of yellows and golds accentuating the color palette of the kitchen at Gusteau's. Black levels and contrast are perfect in revealing all the fine detailed lines from the hugeness of Linguini's nose down to the tiny hairs and whiskers of Remy and his clan. Images are always sharp, and the image itself provides for some great example of depth and dimensionality. There are no signs of aliasing, color banding, or any other hiccups making for some beautiful shots of photography amongst the backdrop of Paris, and even some of the inner housing of Linguini's apartment, the kitchen, and the sewers. There also appear to be no signs of artificial enhancement or manipulation, making this a transfer as perfect as you can get and ready to be showcased for all.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Using an uncompressed PCM 5.1 track, Ratatouille is equally as stunning as it's video counterpart. Dialogue is clear, and directionality is particularly precise during kitchen scenes with the clanging of pots and pans, whooshing of flames, and dribbles of liquid all over the place. Music accompanies the sound effects perfectly and immerses the viewer with some wonderful and adventurous melodies that really compliment the story telling, never overdoing itself or intruding over the dialogue. LFEs are most prominent during musical numbers and when things are being chopped up. There really are no flaws with the general sound design and placement and should be enjoyable by the ears of any.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />Personally, I found the extras to be very fun and informative. But the only gripe I have is that they didn't put the "making of" featurettes on as separate 25GB disc by itself. Instead of SD specials, they could've well been HD. Other than that, though, they're all very enjoyable. The Pixar animated shorts are always a nice addition, while the "rat history" as narrated by Remy and Emile served as a cute parody of how rats could be thought of under a different light (not that it'll ever happen since rats aren't as smart as this, but the effort is appreciated). Then of course there's the production segments, which continue to amaze me in how hard it really is to produce films of this caliber. I highly respect and give thanks to all the people involved in these types of projects.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />The only thing that would've made this release any better is an extra disc specifically reserved for the special features. But other than that, it's an extreme delight to have watched this film for its cheery and lovable narrative about personal passion and the following of one's dreams. With immaculate A/V quality and an excellent set of extras and special features, I can't recommend this title enough for both kids and adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Ratatouille (Brad Bird, 2007)<br /><br />In 1994, Pixar shot to the top of the American heap of animators with Toy Story. At the same time, the similarly placed giant of the Japanese animation industry, Studio Ghibli, started gaining American converts; a few years later, critics saw Princess Mononoke and realized that there might be something to this guy Hayao Miyazaki's directorial skills after all. Then came 2001, and each studio released its (to date) magnum opus; Pixar treated us to Monsters, Inc., while Ghibli unleashed Spirited Away, both of which are widely considered to be among the thousand or so finest movies ever made. There, their paths diverged. Ghibli, never known for being a factory, has released only a single movie since (Howl's Moving Castle), with its second in the period since slated for release in 2008. Pixar, on the other hand, who had previously followed a somewhat similar release schedule, started plowing them out like gangbusters. Pixar have released, on average, one full-length movie per year since 2003. Some studios can do that and not sacrifice the quality inherent in their previous stock. Pixar, as it turns out, was not one of them. Whereas Toy Story (and its sequel) and Monsters, Inc. are fantastic movies for all ages of viewer, the post-2001 material has become increasingly kid-centric. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing if your target audience is kids. But, as the makers of any number of kids'-movie flops in recent years (with 2006 a nadir) will lament, what does it matter if your target audience (a) can't drive and (b) has parents who cower in terror at the thought of seeing whatever it kids the kids are so all-fired excited about? The lowest point, for Pixar, came with last year's Cars; the only person I know who actually likes the movie was three years old when it came out.<br /><br />I don't know whether someone at Pixar realized that Ghibli was pulling away with amazing speed in the animation wars, or whether cooler heads finally prevailed, but Ratatouille is a long-awaited return to form--a Pixar movie that will enchant both kids and adults alike. Well, except for those who don't like rats. The story focuses on Remy (The King of Queens' Patton Oswalt), a highly intelligent rat who's obsessed with cooking. Through a series of misadventures, Remy hooks up with Linguini (Pixar regular Lou Romano), a janitor at the restaurant of the chef Remy idolizes, and Remy finds his opportunity to become a world-class chef with Linguini acting as his hands. A simple plot, as in the best Pixar movies, rapidly spirals out of control into something Corinthian in its complexity, while the visuals provide a feast of amusing details that show there's a brilliant mind at work behind the controls. Bird, responsible for the decent-but-nothing-special The Incredibles a few years ago, finally lives up to the promise he showed with The Iron Giant. This is the kind of stuff Pixar is capable of putting out when it brings it's a game, and it's wonderful to see Pixar bringing it's a game again. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>rat-uh-too-ee is a vegetable stew of provence. Typically consisting of eggplant, zucchini, onions, green peppers, tomatoes, and garlic. Oh yeah, and in this case served hot. With maybe, a few rat hairs. It is, climatically, the settling point for many cases in a movie filled with warm messages. We get confessions aplenty, because confessions free the spirit. Confessions from a daunting critic, Antun Ego (Peter o'Toole), whose brutal review of the parisian chef Auguste Gusteau, leads to Gusteau's premature death (he was very fat also so that helps). Satisfied with the destruction of the famous Gusteau (much like today's tabloids and almost heretical demands from our public towards any celebrity) he turns the page, as we say, on those things and files it in some drawer and moves on to another hapless professional. Confessions ultimately lead to....redemptions. And those are plenty also. We have messeges about the importance of family, and of love and the pursuit of happiness. You can learn alot, and disregard human prejudices, therefor becoming more receptive, by embodying human themes with cute and hilarious animals.

And, indeed, there are times when the pacing does tend to drag a bit even for more seasoned moviegoers like myself.  Still, the action scenes are palpitating in their energy and excitement, and even those jaded by the unimaginable strides made in CGI technology over the years will be properly bowled over by what the filmmakers have managed to pull off here.  The sheer fluidity of movement alone in this film is draw-dropping in its impressiveness.  The story is rather less compelling overall, but one has to admire Bird's willingness to keep the drama at least somewhat intimate and life-sized.  The price of that subtlety, however, is that the movie is also a trifle dull in spots.<br /><br />The film is highly blessed with energetic voice work by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole, and, above all, Janeane Garofalo as a high-strung, up-and-coming chef who doesn't take too kindly to fresh-out-of-the-oven competitors encroaching on her territory.<br /><br />But it is the exquisitely designed backdrops that finally make "Ratatouille" a thing of joy and beauty.

Lots of fun to watch with kids who love to eat interesting and exotic food. For that matter, it would be a good way to get picky eaters introduced to flavors and trying new things.<br /><br />The flashback sequence with Anton Ego (eating Ratatouille) was so well done it wouldn't have been out of place in a feature film.<br /><br />But that violence really brings it down. It's a "G" movie after all!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie is very serious compared to the Shrek. I found very few funny moments. The cartoon characters are lively and beautiful.<br /><br />It's worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>After reading the glowing reviews, I had nothing but the highest expectations from Ratatouille.  Ratatouille is terrible. I can describe it no other way.  What was the point of this film? I suppose something democratic like "anyone can cook," but honestly, was that really the point?  The story was boring. Really boring...and predictable and way too long.  Ratatouille had two stories that went nowhere.<br />Everyone knows the premise by now: a rat works undercover as a chef in a fancy restaurant to prove that "anyone" can be a great chef if they want to. We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two "human" leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends. We don't; the story just limps to its foregone conclusion.<br />Not the worst film I have every seen but in no way what so ever a classic of any type.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>There's been a buy one, get one free deal on Disney movies in the UK recently. I treated myself to Robin Hood and Sword In The Stone. Those were the two I could find. The rest I had no interest in even picking up. Disney movies never appealed to me after Pocahontas came out, and I've rarely watched one since. The big movies recently have been the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Cars etc, some with Pixar at the helm. But I never jumped at the chance to get any of them. They just didn't have the same appeal as the old Disney classics.<br /><br />Instead of sitting at home after a long day at work, I decided to go see this with my boyfriend, which meant lots of rushing about trying to make myself look presentable, but surprisingly worth it. Many of the people I work with know of my distaste for animation, and instantly said I wouldn't enjoy this.<br /><br />There were a handful of kids at the cinema. The rest were adults. I'm still not keen on being in the cinema with kids - there was a child a few rows in front of us, who got taken to the toilet a couple of times, but who was always away for at least 20 minutes! Why bother? And then there was the child who had a seriously high pitched laugh, and who I'm yet to figure out whether it was a boy or girl.<br /><br />Ratatouille surprised me, it really did. From the pre-credit sequence (something that doesn't seem to really match up to the rest of the movie) which was hilarious, to Remy, the rat with a taste for good cuisine, the movie was good. Slightly too long for my taste, I was starting to get restless, but it was funny, and well done. The pre-credit sequence with the aliens, was so funny, and I've been walking around the day after seeing it, and laughing to myself.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this was the lack of real celebrity voices. There were three I could pick out, maximum. Peter O'Toole was the voice of Anton Ego, Janeane Garofalo was the voice of Collette, and Jamie Oliver (famous British chef) is the voice of the health inspector. Normally these days every character is voiced by a celebrity.<br /><br />The plot is quite funny, although will make you hungry, but I won't give any of it away here. There is a story behind this, which is basically don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something. You can and you will. I thought it was quite subtle. It is quite simplistic at the same time, from the animation style, to the story. Whether it will become a classic I don't know, but I've added the DVD to my wishlist, as I really want to watch that pre-credit sequence again. I can't persuade anyone to go see this film, I wouldn't have managed to persuade ME to go see this film, but I like it when I get surprised by a movie I wouldn't have thought I would have liked.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This is an adult movie. What I mean by that is children wouldnt understand the point of this film. I mean come on, culinary art? Why would that even interest kids? It didnt even interest me and I'm 24. It wasn't funny or cute it was just odd. Of course the computer work on this is fantastic, but that is where it stops. I do not understand why so many people love this film. I was utterly bored and dissinterested in it from the beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHV42BTJSVON.html">A2RHV42BTJSVON</a><br/><p>NOTE:  This is a a review/analysis, so it goes a little more in-depth than most of my reviews.<br /><br />  Even though this may be Pixar's weakest film (I will explain why later), it is still miles ahead of most other animated films that have been released in the last five years.  I love Pixar's movies, especially "Cars", "Finding Nemo", and "Toy Story", and I also love rats, I have had one as a pet for the last four years.  So, what kept me from truly enjoying this film?<br /><br />  There is nothing fundementally wrong with this film, it is a feast to the eyes.  The film is so beautiful visually, it looks like it isn't even animated most of the time.  It is certainly a treat to see Paris depicted in this film, it is just georgeous, especailly the shots that are done at night time.  Even the lead rat Remy and his furry rat friends look quite realistic.<br /><br />  The story is engaging enough, it is about a rat named Remy who has an exceptional gift for smell and tasting food.  He desires to be a chef after he sees the chef Gusteau on a cooking show, and struggles to develop this gift while the rest of his family is ignorant and misunderstanding of his gift.  After the colony gets chased out of their house, Remmy winds up in Paris at Gusteau's old resturant and runs into  Linquini, a hapless young man who just started as the Dishwasher at Gusteau's.  Of course they form a bond, and help and hurt eachother throughout the course of the movie as they discover who they are.<br /><br />  The main problem I have with this film is the character development.  As far as Remy goes, I just do not see him treating Linquini the way he does towards the end of the film, and vice versa with Linquini.  They are both depicted as people who found each other and truly care about one another, but needlessly hurt each other still.  At the same time this could be interpreted as human frailty, but that is just not what the movie is about.  If they would have just stuck to the main point that anyone can achieve their dreams, then it would have been a better movie.  The end of the movie and the way the food critic Anton Ego turned around was very improbable to me because of the character that was developed throughout the movie.<br /><br />  Again, this is an extremely enjoyable film, but it was just hard to truly enjoy a movie that humanizes animals so strongly.  I love movies like "Babe" and "Charlotte's Web", but this one just seemed to take it a step too far.  It blurs the lines between humans and animals and puts them on the same level as us.  So, in spite of these flaws, it is still leaps and bounds ahead of other animated films that have come out lately, it is just not up to Pixar's normal quality.<br /><br />  God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Everyone knew that Paris hotels had the biggest, friendliest and juiciest fleas in the world with whom all tourists fell in love at the first bite. A real legend these fleas of Paris Hotels. Ask Ms Paris Hilton: she will tell you everything about it and she can compare with the fleas of American prisons. But Walt Disney has decided to go a lot further in its debunking of Paris, to teach those damned urban frogs a good lesson since they don't seem to have understood that they had to make themselves very, very small after their being rejected for the 2012 Olympic Games. And the lesson is as hot as hell. All best restaurants in Paris have hired, as chefs in their kitchens, the ugliest and least hygienic people they could find, I mean the gutter and sewage rats, and there again Paris has a record: not so much as for the quality of their rats but as for the number of them. It is even murmured that unemployment has gone suddenly down in Paris because of this hiring policy of Paris hotels since all unemployed people in Paris, particularly in the ethnic northern and eastern suburbs, are nothing but rats basking in the moonshine. That will show how low these Frenchies of Paris have gone: their haute cuisine is done and produced by rats. You can be rest assured that in the next Walt Disney film they will show that French haute couture is in the hand of a bunch of pigs and French perfumes in the hands, or shouldn't I say in the sweaty shoes, of bedbugs, or who knows what other stinking beetle or skunk. The kids though love it and there is some humor here and there, and I must say the Parisians deserve it quite a lot because they are always obnoxious with foreigners, strangers and tourists. All serious study proves it with hard data. So they just get the change their fake forged bank notes deserve. But there are some myths that like going around in the world. Ratatouille has nothing to do with Paris since it is a dish prepared in Marseilles, originally, at least as far I know, though some dictionaries tell me it is from Nice. Same mistake. At least they do not bring up the most popular and famous dish of France in France today, i.e. couscous, that is prepared, it is well known in France, by some special species of rats, but this would have been racist. At least one thing will be sure: French fries will no longer be what they used to be. I bet they can be called fried rat's nests and enter the legend that in Haute Cuisine they don't have cockroaches, but they have coq au vin, and no one knows what's the connection between the two, nor which one is better than the other. At least in Paris you can't make the difference. I must admit though the few views of the Eiffel Tower were quite appetizing.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Maintaining the status quo can be damaging to films, especially thanks to the highly popular animations that have graced the silver screen (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYC1">SHREK</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">THE INCREDIBLES</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQ5UHS">HOODWINKED!</a>)Audiences get bored if all you show us is the same ol' same ol'. And this is where RATATOUILLE runs into trouble.<br /><br />Written and directed by Brad Bird (who also did The Incredibles and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009M9BK">THE IRON GIANT</a>), Mr. Bird has fallen into a small rut; one that I hope he doesn't remain in. Yes, the animation was great. Yes, the voices were wonderful. Yes, the story was cute and funny. But there was nothing new. We've seen these themes over and over and over again, and it's becoming a bit tiresome.<br /><br />Instead of a superhero family or a misunderstood ogre, this time we've got an English speaking French rat (don't ask) who's taste for expensive foods -- and not garbage -- gets him into trouble. Living the life of the dull and mundane with the rest of his extended family, Remy (Patton Oswalt, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TUL01E">RENO 911!: MIAMI</a>) soon has buckshot whizzing by all of his furry brethren. Removed from his familial upbringing, Remy turns quickly toward his love for rich foods. His astutely attuned nose leads him to Paris (as does a ghostly visitation from a world famous chef known as Gusteau voiced by Brad Garrett, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPE3">MUSIC AND LYRICS</a>), where he finds a now corrupted and dying restaurant named after its formerly famous cook (the aforementioned Gusteau). He also runs into the newly hired garbage boy named (not funnily) Linguini (Lou Romano, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS0">CARS</a>). After being captured in the kitchen, Remy is caged and taken to the river by Linguini where he's told to dispose of the rodent in the nearby river. But Remy and Linguini soon realize they can understand one another, and Linguini can't bring himself to the kill the little fella. What does happen, though, is that a bizarre relationship builds and Linguini quickly becomes the soup chef thanks to Remy's ability to identify delectable food. Hidden under Linguini's hat (literally), rat and human become the master-blaster (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729342">ROAD WARRIOR</a> reference) of Gusteau's restaurant.<br /><br />Swirling around this story is also a love interest between another chef named Collette (Janeane Garofalo) and Linguini, the battle between thievery and survival that Remy must address when his extended rat family pops in, and, of course, the battle that Linguini must do with a very Tim Burtonesque looking food critic named Anton Ego (the estimable Peter O'Toole, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDWKXI">CASANOVA</a>).<br /><br />Not surprisingly, everything works out in the end thanks to human ingenuity and rodent accompaniment.<br /><br />But, again, this isn't something we haven't seen before. It's old terrain covered many times, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars. Had it not been for the awesome voice of Mr. O'Toole as the food critic, it may not have gotten even that.<br /><br />Kids will enjoy the action. Parents will like the familiar territory. And let's hope that the two can talk about the necessity for rats to NOT be in restaurants.</p></br><a href="../users/ACKDSX71VI5HY.html">ACKDSX71VI5HY</a><br/><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Except for the critical knee-jerk reaction to label anything Pixar produces as brilliant, I will never understand the rationale for calling this movie anything other than a disgusting, boring waste of time.<br /><br />While on the whole Pixar does create brilliant animated work(the "Toy Story" films and the more recent "Up" numbering among those), this film was a colossal bomb which they hid behind admittedly impressive animated views of Paris and an appeal to snobbery under the guise of satirizing French cuisine.  Additionally, the audience is treated to several views of thousands of digitized rats swarming together.  It was massive, foolish hubris to think that it was possible to marry rats with cooking, and make it work.  Human nature itself rebels against the notion.<br /><br />Appearing vocally are Patton Oswalt and Jeaneane Garafalo, amongst others.  I suppose they are here to collect the inevitable large check, and say they've been in a Pixar movie.  It's just a shame that they could not have picked a better one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Many, many companies have created movies that focused on relationships between animals, people, and inanimate objects as key plot lines.  Most of these movies come up short as the interactions between humans and non-humans often seem forced or fake; examples include "All Dogs go to Heaven", "Howard the Duck", "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Cool World".  But Pixar has mastered this art, with classics such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and now Ratatouille.  Released in 2007, this movie is by far the best animated movie of 2007, if not one of the best movies overall.  It features an original cast of characters that include a cooking rat, his clumsy human apprentice, the latter's lady of interest, a conniving head chef, an imposing restaurant reviewer, the rat's lackadasical brother, and their selfish, hard-headed father.  The setting is Paris and the surrounding French countryside, and the musical score fits the French setting perfectly.  The storyline itself is amazing and original; I cannot remember any other movie with even a slight similarity in plot.  And the animation is perfect; to see the rats move, the ripples in a bowl of soup, the flutter of leaves; all of it looks so real.  Best of all is the comedy, again a trademark of all Disney classics.  All in all, one of the best movies of 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I had reservations about Pixar's ability to pull this one off.<br />All of Pixar's movies have had non human stars in them.<br />I approached this film with an open mind and I came away absolutely stunned at how good it was.<br />Another Pixar triumph!!!<br />The acting, script, animation, EVERYTHING is just so perfect.<br />Is Pixar run by some alien force that just "KNOWS" how to make the perfect movie???<br />Pixar has yet to make one dud of a movie.<br />Well.........I really didn't care for A Bugs Life that much.

Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS0">Cars</a>, this 2007 confection runs nearly two hours, comparatively long for an animated film, with a story that demands more attention than most. Unlike the animated films under Disney's banner, this one doesn't offer any musical numbers as story breaks. Director/co-screenwriter Brad Bird, who was also behind the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles</a>, returns with a charmer that is as much a sumptuous treat for the Food Network generation as it is a parable about self-fulfillment and tolerance. Except for a few set pieces, especially toward the end, the movie is not quite as exhilarating as previous efforts, but there is no getting around its sheer entertainment value.<br /><br />The dense plot focuses primarily on Remy, an intellectually curious rat with a heightened sense of smell. He lives in a rodent colony in the French countryside headed by his wizened father Django, who uses Remy to smell everyone's food for possible poison. However, Remy has bigger dreams of becoming a chef like Gusteau, the recently deceased guiding light behind Paris' finest restaurant. While escaping from an old crone whose kitchen he has been using, Remy fittingly ends up at Gusteau's where he meets a bumbling garbage boy named Linguini. By hiding under Linguini's chef hat and pulling on his scalp like a puppeteer, Remy is now able to fulfill his dream of becoming a world-class chef. Thanks to Remy's culinary wizardry, Linguini becomes the talk of the town. Naturally, Linguini has to take credit for Remy's dishes and attracts the attention of fellow sous-chef Colette who has dreams of becoming a chef herself. No fanciful story like this would be complete without a villain, and this time, it is Skinner, the small, self-centered sous-chef who took over the restaurant after Gusteau's death only to cheapen the master chef's name by developing a line of microwavable food products to mass market.<br /><br />The rest of the story plays itself out in inevitable fashion but with plenty of clever twists and turns thanks to the perceptive screenplay by Bird, Jan Pinkava and Jim Capobianco, which focuses on the human qualities in the rodents. Needless to say, the CGI work is impressive, especially when the rats literally take over the kitchen. However, the visual realism of seeing the rats swarm in multiple battalions is a bit daunting to watch no matter how human Bird tries to make them. Despite the appearance of marquee names, the vocal casting is for the most part, merely serviceable. Comedian Patton Oswalt brings the right level of enthusiastic optimism to Remy's voice, while Brad Garrett (Gusteau's spirit), Ian Holm (Skinner), Janeane Garofalo (Colette) and Will Arnett (fellow sous-chef Horst) lose much of their individual personalities to their thick French accents. Lou Romano lends a fumbling callowness to Linguini, while Brian Dennehy is certainly recognizable as Django. The true standout, however, is Peter O'Toole who voices intimidating food critic Anton Ego with his usual theatrical flair.<br /><br />I'm surprised the extras on the 2007 DVD are relatively sparse for a major Pixar release. There is no commentary track from Bird, but instead, a 14-minute featurette with him and master chef Thomas Keller, who opened his kitchen at the legendary French Laundry restaurant to the animation team. This isn't Keller's first foray into cinema since he helped prepare Adam Sandler for his role as a celebrity chef in the execrable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OCG56">Spanglish</a>. The two best extras are the animation shorts. The first is the five-minute "Lifted" that preceded the movie in many theaters. It's an amusing take on the abduction scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>. The second is the clever, ten-minute "Your Friend the Rat" which features Remy and his chubby brother Emile carrying on about the joys of being a rat and why we should love them, too. There are also three deleted scenes with introductions and plenty of previews from both Pixar and Disney.</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>I remember the first time I ever saw a teaser for this movie. I thought it looked silly and I had to wonder just what Pixar and Disney were thinking. A rat wanting to get fancy Frency food. Please.<br /><br />But time went by, and cuter trailers appeared, and I found myself wanting to see the movie about the cute rat in the restaurant. So it came out and I had a free weekend.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where you spend the whole time thinking "This is so good!" while at the same time barely having enough time to think so as you are so caught up in the story and the stellar animation. It's subtle, heartfelt, and downright hilarious with a character-driven plot and so many themes I can't possibly count them all.<br /><br />Remy is a rat not altogether satisfied with his garbage-eating existence in the French countryside. He was born with an extreme sense of smell, which makes him useful to his colony when it comes to sniffing out rat poison--one of the many reasons his fellow rats despise humans. But Remy is fascinated by humans and their ability to create things, and eventually his interest leads him into the world of cooking when his nose becomes handy in blending flavors. A tragedy leads him to Paris, more specifically Gusteau's, the fallen-from-grace restaurant that had once belonged to the deceased chef Remy admired. Here he meets Linguini, an awkward young man who can't cook, and they figure they can help each other out.<br /><br />Do not be misled--this is far from being the only part of this incredible story. Rather there is a series of incidents created by a colorful cast of characters that leads us not only from movie's beginning to end but through some amazing character development and more plot events; it's infinitely better than contrived and forced plots that are so often shoved down our throats. This has many stories: the aforementioned, Remy's division between the worlds of rats and humans, an adorable love story between Linguini and a driven cook by the name of Collette, and that of Skinner, the new head chef determined to keep the restaurant under his own power. While we all love an intense character, "Ratatouille" keeps its players surprisingly realistic and subtle rather than making them into a circus of stereotypes. Admittedly, disbelief must be suspended in certain parts, but the story is so endearing and good that you are certainly willing to do so.<br /><br />The complexity of so many things is what make this film stand out. As Remy is torn between the worlds of humans and rats he is faced with the contradiction of what he is: a rat wanting to cook, but stealing food at the same time. Also there is the problem of Remy wanting credit, but neither wanting to lose his place in the world of gourmet. You must also notice the range between the fanciful talking rats and the realistic problems of wills and DNA testing. It works.<br /><br />I know I said I could not name the many themes circulating through this movie, but I must go at one. The title "Ratatouille" is not only a pun referring to the rodent characters, but is also a peasant dish never to be served at a fancy French restaurant. It's low, it's common, but as the movie shows can be more than any other food. This is a story about finding greatness in the ordinary.<br /><br />I feel this is one of Pixar's finest. It is a film that will stay with you long after it has finished.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>A rat that wants to be a chef.

Yes, they ARE hungry monsters, but they are quite cute while they're at it. Even if you're not a food lover or a rat lover, chances are you will be charmed by this highly imaginative and creative film.<br /><br />Five Stars for the movie, and the glorious French title song.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>What a delightful movie!  A family movie that is fun, has a story that is engaging for children and adults, and is quite fresh.  I mean a story about a rat who cooks?  Rats around human food are most everyone's nightmare, but Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose food you would want to taste.  He is a rat you would like to get to know.  Remy is a rat we want to see in at least one sequel!<br /><br />Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), is the leader of their huge rat clan.  They scavenge where they can and stay out of sight of humans as much as they can.  Emile (Peter Sohn) is Remy's not too bright brother who is happy to eat anything almost constantly.  Remy has become a fan of a once great French Chef named Gusteau (Brad Garrett) who died of a broken heart shortly after his masterpiece "Anyone Can Cook" was published and panned by the feared food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />By the time fate gets Remy to Gusteau's restaurant, it is an institution for the tourists, although the cooks there care in their own way.  Chef Skinner managed to take the place over and is gearing up to market Gusteau's image on a variety of frozen foods.<br /><br />This is as far as I want to take you in setting up the story.  Well, one more thing.  A young man named Linguini shows up looking for any job.  His mother has died and she was a friend of Gusteau's, so he gets a job cleaning up.  Remy and Linguini form as close a friendship as a rat and a young man can have, given the language barriers and all.  However, it does help that Remy can understand humans and can even read.<br /><br />This is a movie I have watched several times already and is still very enjoyable.  Superbly done in every way.  The animation is wonderful and the voice characterizations are great (there are many more fine performances than I could list).  Enjoy it!<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>There have been so many reviews written here that there is not a whole lot that I can add to what has already been said.  I'll merely state that this is my favorite animated film of the year.  I'll also confess that when I first heard about it and saw the previews, I was not impressed.  To me a movie about a rat who was also a cooking genius seemed both farfetched and ludicrous.  I was convinced that they had more or less run out of ideas.  I was wrong.  The film is bristling with great ideas and wonderful touches of humor.  The software that allows them to produce this level of CGI is nothing short of astonishing.  It only makes you wonder what software thirty years from now is going to make possible.<br /><br />One interesting decision is the way that in their CGI and character design they've decided to go incredibly realistic in all inanimate objects, but somewhat "cartoonish" in all animated characters.  The software has clearly come to the point where it would be possible to make humans look extremely realistic.  Instead, they decided to make them look like extreme caricatures.  I personally applaud this decision.  It makes for far more expressive characters.  Also, if they were trying for extreme realism it would call too much attention to that fact.<br /><br />After this film and THE INCREDIBLES, I might be willing to say that Brad Bird is my favorite animated director currently working in the United States.  I can't be too confident in saying that simple because his total body of work is too small.  But I was delighted with THE IRON GIANT when it first came out and he has done nothing since then to disappointment me.  From here on out I'll go out of my way to see one of his movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>The movie is excellent overall.  A few points: 1) Way too long, needs a good 15-20 min of editing.  2)  Too many scenes are either dull, unneeded dialogue or silly racing around, without any jokes.  3) The lost son ploy was poorly designed, and could have been a surprise with a lot less explaining and head stratching. 4)  Too many starts and stops, the flow is messed up with poor editing and excessive length.  5) Overall, a fun and humorous story for all ages.

What's so refreshing about their approach is the male-centric perspective the movies bring, be it a single father searching for his son (Finding Nemo), a single male learning the responsibility of raising a child (Monsters, Inc.), or male bonding between friends (Toy Story).  And then there's Ratatouille.<br /><br />Our rat hero, Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a rat who wants to be a chef.  Our human hero, Linguini (Lou Romano), is a garbage boy for the fine French restaurant Gusteau's with a mysterious past who just wants to get the girl (Colette, voiced by Jeanine Garofalo). These two eventually cross paths and struggle with the boundaries that separate man from rodent, the untalented from the prodigy.  Remy strikes out on his own and gets a job (of sorts), distancing himself from his family and friends. Linguini struggles to impress Colette in the kitchen under the devious watch of Skinner (Ian Holm). Throughout we hear the mantra: "Anyone can cook!" as espoused by the ghostly "figment of Remy's imagination," August Gusteau (Brad Garrett).<br /><br />Unlike the other Pixar movies that are tightly focused on a single core message and convey it beautifully, Ratatouille is all over the place.  Will Remy convince his family that striking out on his own was a good idea?  Will he make it as a rat turned chef?  Can he keep up his fa?ade as a puppet master of Linguini's cooking talent?  Speaking of Linguini, what is his mysterious background all about?  Will Linguini convince Colette of his love? Will Skinner figure out Linguini has no talent for cooking?  And what IS Linguini's talent anyway? Will Skinner get away with his plans to sully the reputation of Gusteau's restaurant through blatant commercialization?<br /><br />But that's not what Ratatouille is all about.  It's actually about the crypt-like critic known as Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole with creaky menace). He is a bitter, unlikable skeleton of a man, thin where Gusteau was fat.  Ego doesn't like food; he claims that he loves it, and if he doesn't love it, "I don't SWALLOW." Somewhere in the course of Ego's career as a food critic, he lost track of what makes life enjoyable.  It's up to our dynamic duo to convince him otherwise.<br /><br />So the message isn't actually about whether or not anyone can cook.  It's about remembering what matters about food: not the taste so much as the feelings and memories associated with it.  Unfortunately, that message is muddled by all the other questions laid out in the film.<br /><br />As a result of all the other plotlines, some of the characters become one-dimensional.  The rats are more fleshed out than the humans.  In fact, Linguini seems like such a doofus with no actual skill that it's hard to care about his plight or what Colette sees in him.  It's implied that his true calling is as a roller-skating waiter, but that talent appears in the last few minutes of the film.<br /><br />Ratatouille wraps up with Ego's epiphany, another human who isn't fleshed out nearly as much as his counterparts.  The fairytale ending is a bit hard to swallow, but that probably depends on your opinion of rats in a kitchen.  Overall, Ratatouille has a lot of heart but not a lot of art, and the film's lack of focus prevents it from becoming a true Pixar classic.</p></br></body></html>

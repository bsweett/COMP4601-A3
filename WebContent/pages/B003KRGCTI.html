The movie has a religious message that will turn alot of nonbelievers off, if they cannot get past it. Being somewhat of a neutral person when it comes to religion, I enjoyed the movie as just what it was, a movie. And if it makes you feel any better, one of the Hughes Brothers is an atheist. So if an atheist can direct a film about the power of the Bible, everyone should be able to watch it. Sorry if anyone considers that a spoiler, but yeah. The Book of Eli is a Holy Bible. I was quite impressed to see old Denzel swinging his machete, dagger or whatever the blade was, like a trained assassin. No matter how good I expect him to perform, he always does better. It was also nice to see Gary Oldman return to his roots as the villain after nearly a decade of playing Sirius Black in Harry Potter and Gordan in Batman. Mila Kunis is okay, but I'm not sure if she was exactly right for her role. She looked and sounded so clean and neat, while everyone else around her looked like they were actually in a post-apocalytic world. She wasn't bad though. Overall, The Book of Eli is pretty good. It's definitely worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>A friend of mine strongly recommended this film to me. I saw it wondering what's going on. I was impressed with the cinematrography but it grew old and then I looked for the story which this film really doesn't have. I understand a lot of people have credited this film and some have even discussed their disagreement with the central character and wondered what religion he belongs to. I, sadly, am never going to reach that stage because this film doesn't deserve discussion. In some way, it's hopeless, lacks any half intelligent dialog, the only thing effective is the soundtrack, the action sequences are bizzare and I feel today's audience is too intelligent and a tad bit too impatient to sit through something like this. Atleast this is my opinion. The film had absolutely no premise, there is just one central character of Washington who acts like he's a messiah of some sort, at no point in this film is any wit, any humor, any heartfelt emotion displayed. I'm a big Washington fan but I was disappointed he made something like this.<br /><br />Because people have liked this, I would strongly recommend you watching it prior to buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>I saw this film by accident. I actually went to the theatre to see "Avatar" (like everyone else in the state that day) and decided to see the Book of Eli since Avatar was sold out. I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />The Book of Eli is an amazing film for many reasons, mainly because it handles its religious themes with a intelligence and an even hand. This is NOT an action film - that is the mistake; the movie is a religious fable but not a heavy-handed fire-and-brimstone manner.<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as Eli, a man on a cross country mission in a post-apocolyptic America. People have resorted to cannibalism to survive. While Eli stops by a small relatively civilized town, he is confronted by the film's villain played by Gary Oldman who is the leader of the town. He has been searching the countryside, looking for a special book, the book that Eli has pledged to carry across the country. The film revolves around Eli's escape from the town, with a young girl in tow, and his journey across the country.<br /><br />So that is the basic plot. There is a "surprise" ending at the end, but there is more going on than just the basic plot. The power of faith, fake religious leaders, miracles and hope are themes that are explored in this film in a very intelligent and effective manner. The Book of Eli can appeal not on the Christians, but the ideas in this movie can speak to people of any faith - or no faith. Its a very positive movie.<br /><br />Its amazing that this movie was made, it really struck me on a deep emotional level. It will not be popular with the Pat Robertsons of the world due to its criticism of the misuse of religion. Some people will be far too jaded to accept this movie for what it is. I highly recommend this film to anyone; at least watch it once. I can't wait to see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>This is one of the most wonderful post apocalyptic stories I've ever seen. It tells the story in a simple manner yet leaves it riveted to the mind. The story of a man on a mission and how he encounters the many obstacles along the way. The setting and scenery seem grim but as the story unfurls it grabs your attention and you can even manage some laughs. As usual Denzel Washington plays the role to the T.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>It did have the effect of making us argue afterwards, and all weekend long, about the two so-called surprise twists in the picture.  It's worth seeing if only for that good post-mortem that sends you to the diner arguing over french fries about the real meaning of the scene between Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is ridiculously bleak and heavyhanded.  Tumbleweeds, check.  Sepia tones throughout, check.  Cannibals, check.  It is a patchwork of familiar elements that you have seen done better in a hundred other movies.  In one scene, Denzel is held captive in a cell-like room decorated only by a tattered poster from a long-ago 70s apocalypse film, Don Johnson in A Boy and His Dog--itself so much better than The Book of Eli it seemed almost as if the movie was taunting itself!  But instead it was probably intended as a homage...  Much of the movie was one homage stitched onto another...  When Mila Kunis made the sign of the cross to a leering Gary Oldman, it was so much like Bram Stoker's Dracula it was crazy!  And what about the old, decrepit desert house occupied by the two seniors, who call themselves George and Martha?  Their names recall the central couple in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but why?<br /><br />Denzel, Gary Oldman, most of the actors were good, but against all odds.  The things they had to say and act out were ludicrous.  Defeated, perhaps by her character arc, perhaps by her own limitations, was poor Mila Kunis.  I thought Kylie Minogue, much as I love her, a bad actress, but Mila Kunis makes Kylie seem like Dame Judi Dench in comparison.  And yet, I wound up liking her just the same, especially when I read the interview with her that said in preparation for playing "Solara" opposite Denzel Washington, she had tried to read the Bible.  "Which part?"  "The first part.  Genesis.  But I just couldn't finish it.  It was good but it was boring."  Now, that's what my dad used to call "stick to it-ive-ness."</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Well, there's not much new or thought provoking offered in 'The Book of Eli' that helps this film standout in the much overdone post-apocalyptic film genre. You know the scenario, the vast majority of mankind has been wiped-out almost overnight, now only small pockets of communities remain, each location having little to know knowledge as to where the others might be. Law and order have become a thing of the past, now control belongs in the hands of the strongest and of course the most evil of the survivors.<br /><br />In this "only the strong survive" world comes the man in dark sunglasses, Denzel Washington who possesses a book more valuable than gold. When evil guy Gary Oldman learns of the book he sends his minions after it and the battle begins.<br /><br />Again, nothing new here, a little 'Mad Max' and 'Waterworld' along with an added secret ala 'The Sixth Sense' that serves as an interesting twist at the end but not enough to make you want to watch the movie again and look for the clues you missed the first time through. However if you're a Denzel or Oldman fan it's worth at least one viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Really thoughful storyline.  Strong religious overtones -- basically a futuristic tale about how the Bible becomes the most sought after book on earth after a war which leads to the destruction of most of humankind.<br /><br />As usual, Denzel Washington is great as the star with Gary Oldman cast as the perfect authoritarian villain.  The future is not pretty as cannibalism, rape, rampant crime, gangs, dominate the new world that emerges after the war.  But the movie ends on a hopeful note.  Better than I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>As a fan of the post-apocalyptic film genre, I enjoyed The Book of Eli for its look, but felt that the story suffered as it went on. With bits of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780624890">Blade</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FBS20">I Am Legend</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA1WGS">The Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB563E">The Road</a>, and a drop of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YV502C">Children of Men</a> mixed in, Book of Eli is a slickly-produced film, with the requisite bleached out colors and monochromatic/desaturated look of the genre. Like The Road, an unexplained nuclear holocaust has wiped out civilization, mentioned only in passing. Once again, our hero must get from point A to point B, traveling a road fraught with difficulties and dangers. And he must do it on foot.<br /><br />Denzel is Eli, a loner and tough-as-nails survivalist tasked with delivering the last remaining x to a safe location. In Children of Men, it was the world's last pregnant woman. In Book of Eli, it's the last remaining copy of the King James Bible. He has been walking for thirty years. The film opens with a very cool sequence of Eli in the forest stalking a feral cat with a bow and arrow, instantly establishing his resourcefulness, marksmanship, and super-badness for the audience. Visually, it just looks fabulous the way the scene is designed and filmed in monochromatic cyan with detritus raining down. Eli speaks softly and carries a big knife. In fact, it's a very, very big knife and he makes expert use of it against the roving gangs of thieves and cut-throats he encounters, hacking off hands and limbs with style. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFWAYU">Wesley Snipes</a> would be proud.<br /><br />The real trouble for Eli (and this film's story) begins when he stops off for supplies at a ramshackle town run by a ruthless man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman), who had been sending out search parties to scour the wasteland for the book. While Eli is a man of faith and cherishes the book as the key to humanity's salvation, Carnegie covets it for a very different reason: to control the masses and expand his influence to other towns. He tries to make a deal and Eli refuses. At this point, Eli is no longer a loner dependent on his wits and reflexes for survival. He picks up extra baggage in the form of an attractive, but altogether annoying and poorly-developed side-kick character (Mila Kunis) who he now has to protect. This is where the script gets sloppy. Instead of being a story of the cool, quiet, and self-reliant stranger who only has himself to look after, it now becomes the story of "save the helpless girl from the bad-guys" and running away from the gangsters.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing details of Eli's survival techniques the most and how he copes with the dangers of the wasteland, but not enough of his back-story is given. That itself isn't the problem, because I'm plenty willing to enjoy a character's unexplained and mystery past and live in the here and now of his present situation, like Clint Eastwood's archetypal loner, the "Man with No Name" from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792842502">The Man with No Name Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly)</a>. The real problem is the irritating tag-along Eli picks up, which for me, ruins the story. Gary Oldman, an actor I respect and admire, underwhelms here. He has played plenty of excellent villains before (Agent Stansfield in Leon, Zorg in Fifth Element), but his portrayal here is lackluster, devoid of quirks, and mostly uninteresting. Also worth mentioning is the wasted potential of Ray Stevenson as Carnegie's lead henchman. He has no memorable lines or scenes and dies in a cheap and inglorious manner.<br /><br />The final segment of the journey is very similar to Children of Men, though I did not mind because what happens after he gets to his destination was a pleasant twist. The very ending quite obviously hints at a sequel possibility with someone taking up Eli's mantle.<br /><br />Unlike some viewers, I did not take this film to be a celebration of religion or a condemnation of it. The Bible is arguable the most important book in western civilization and a natural choice for a film's central plot device. The Book of Eli is not perfect, but it's worth a look if you liked any of the films I mentioned above.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A lone hero must fight his way across the wasteland of post-apocalyptic America to protect a sacred book that holds the key to saving the future of humanity. A well-made post-apocalyptic action drama. This movie has some interesting ideas about a culture and how societies might rebuild themselves. Very watchable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>There's something about Denzel Washington that makes just about anything he appears in all the cooler.  Take The Book of Eli for example: a post-apocalyptic action vehicle that comes off being better than it rightfully should be thanks to the starpower of Washington, who plays the enigmatic, and dangerous, wanderer Eli.  Eli is westward bound and carrying a precious text that soon becomes coveted by the maniacal Carnegie (Gary Oldman) after Eli sets foot in his town.  It isn't long before Eli and young Solara (Mila Kunis) are on the run, all the while dodging other hazards of the barren wasteland.  While The Book of Eli hardly offers anything new to the post-apocalyptic thriller or action genres, it does feature some gorgeous cinematography and camera work, as well as the most inspired direction to come from The Hughes Brothers since Menace II Society.  The action sequences are violent and surprisingly creative, and Washington manages to be equal parts charasmatic and stoic: he truly makes the film as worthwhile as it is.  Oldman is his usual good villainous self, Kunis is easy on the eyes, and supporting turns from Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Tom Waits round things out nicely.  All in all, if you're hoping that The Book of Eli is another The Road, you're sadly mistaken, but if you set your sights a bit lower, you'll come out plesantly surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>The dialog is minimal, but this is very much a visual picture. Film students can probably appreciate the technical aspects of the movie. Excellent cinematography. Any religious overtones are sveltly built into the enviornment itself and not obviously sticking out.<br /><br />Story is well told; definitely a lot of showing more than telling.<br /><br />Minimalist but very strong concentration of the wasteland. Watch how people act around each other even in the simplest of situations. You really do get the sense of how untrusting society has become. The acting from all the characters is superb.<br /><br />Well done movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Reminiscent to scenes from The Road, Eli is walking on road with the land around parched and devesatated.  You come to understand that decades before, mankind had decided that destroying himself was the thing to do.  Washington/Eli comes across some bad guys who he dispatches quickly.  He is like a super hero.  There is nothing he can do wrong in fighting these guys who are trying to take what he has.  Yet, this is some very intense violence, some of the more gory violence as well.  There are some off scene but mostly quick hitting in your face type violence.  There are yet more of this to come.<br /><br />But the story moves a little slowly as he walks toward his ultimate goal.  Moving West.<br /><br />Washington is very intense in this movie.  Gary Oldman (Carnegie), is an ornery leader of a town where it is like the wild west.  They have water, some food, but not much else.  The decay is endless, and you wonder what town they are in.  Kunis plays a young woman who is basically a subject of Oldman, and she comes into contact with Eli and gets involved in his quest without her complete understanding of what it is.<br /><br />The movie is very good, yet, since there are times where you see the devastation and he seems to walk somewhat onward, it may have been good as a subplot to have Eli's early life shown as well as that of Carnegie's. Actually in the DVD extra there is a bit on Carnegie as a child and that may have been a good way to do this, injecting it into the scenes without losing the flavor or the moment.<br /><br />As you know, the book that Eli is carrying is the Bible.  There is a tug here.  The Bible is blamed for the cause of the disaster that has the world as it is.  Yet, it is a book of hope.  One wants it to control others, the other, wants it because he is destined to.<br /><br />The scenes of the bridges and towns after the destruction are intense and seem even real.  The ending is a surprise, gives you a wow moment for sure.  I like the Book of Eli and hope that it continues to find success.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>There is nothing more to the movie than was promised. It is post-apocalypse and Eli (Denzel Washington) must deliver the last KJB to the west.  To do this he must go through Mad Max territory. He makes a stopover in a town ran by Carnegie. Carnegie is Gary Oldman in his Jean Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg character from "The Fifth Element". I guess some people are distend to always play the ruthless bad guy.<br /><br />So will Eli make it out west and foil Zorg (oops) Carnegie or will the bad guy finally win for once.  After all being ruthless has its advantages. Of course, there has to be a ditzy girl to slow or distract Eli from his mission. In the case, it is Solara (Mila Kunis) who is not aware of the wicked ways of the west.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington brings his A Game to every role, and THE BOOK OF ELI is no exception; in fact, this might be one of the actor's finest performances, as Washington plays Eli, a quiet, peace-loving man--yet peace rarely finds him--on a mission of destiny in a post-apocalyptic world.  By now everyone knows what The Book is, and that it is desperately coveted by those who would wield it to control the surviving population, including Carnegie (a brooding Gary Oldman), the kingpin of a town splashed in the midst of desolation.  Thus THE BOOK OF ELI becomes a story of pursuit, with Washington making his way west (followed by young Solara, played by Mila Kunis), with Carnegie's henchmen on his trail.<br /><br />The story is told simply, the settings are compelling and believable, and Washington performs with a grace and dignity that is stunning.  Interspersed throughout the film are several memorable roles, including Jennifer Beals (playing Solara's blind mother), Ray Stevenson (as Redridge, Carnegie's lieutenant), Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour (a cannibalistic couple armed to the max), and Malcolm McDowell (a scholar at the end of Eli's quest).  My only problem with THE BOOK OF ELI centers around the violent confrontations; suspension of disbelief becomes exceedingly difficult when Eli constantly battles hordes of thugs, mows them down like grass, and walks away unscathed.  Annoying to be sure, but not annoying enough to take enjoyment away from a commanding performance and a very moving film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Book of Eli is an entertaining action film.  It's about a man who has invincible (or rather, nearly invincible) super powers as a result of a book he carries around with him everywhere he goes.<br /><br />He also contains super human strengths apparently, whether because of the book or just because the movie writers needed to make something exciting happen in order to entertain the viewers- I don't necessarily know which one it is.<br /><br />Anyway, he travels across deserted lands telling everyone he meets that he's travelling west, until he ends up coming across a group of power hungry smalltown thugs who would like nothing more than to take the book away from him once they discover he's carrying it.<br /><br />The entire storyline consists of the man trying his very best to protect the book and keep it away from those who don't know how to handle its power.<br /><br />I really like the gloomy setting that takes place throughout the movie.  It's always exceptionally bleak and succeeds in delivering the scenery of a post-apocalyptic world perfectly.  The grey clouds, the eerie silence, the emptiness... just a frighteningly realistic scenario.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good for the most part, however my only complaint is that the storyline wasn't strong enough to keep me attached.  There's only so much you can talk about when the storyline pertains to protecting a book with special abilities.<br /><br />However some of the shooting and fighting segments were really good, my favorite being the shoot-out at the one house resulting in a portion of the house literally being blown apart.  I loved this part.<br /><br />Overall, the Book of Eli is a pretty good film.  It's easy to follow, and the action segments are pretty strong.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>If you're willing to suspend disbelief and imagine that this could be a true story about the future, this can be an entertaining movie with good acting and a mix of elements which you probably haven't encountered before.  But if overtly religious themes bother you, this movie may bother you as well, particularly as you approach the end, when the action lessens and the religious message takes over.<br /><br />I'm capable of falling in either of these camps, but I emphasized the former for this movie, so I liked the movie overall, though I didn't love it.  This certainly isn't a truly profound movie, and I don't think it will be one of those movies that I remember for a long time.  I could try to say more about the movie, but it just doesn't motivate me to make the effort ...</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>As I have just watched and reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB563E">The Road [Blu-ray</a>] and I actually watched this movie first, I felt it only fair that I should review it as well, as they both deal with a similar plotline, but are starkly different movies.<br />The synopsis is covered in great detail above (and in other reviews) so I won't spend too long on that, or put in any spoilers, but this story is so much more than was quite unfairly described by one professional critic as "The Road Warrior (Mad Max) without cars!"<br />Denzel Washington plays a nomadic man on a mission, wandering for some 30 years through a post apocalyptic landscape carrying the last known copy of the King James Bible, answering a calling, and quest to deliver it somewhere important, knowing only that he must go west.<br />Like the aforementioned "Road" he is waylaid by marauding gangs, cannibalism, and a general dystopian population left either blind or maimed by whatever catastrophe occurred. Enter Gary Oldman as a intelligent but malevolent self proclaimed leader of a small town, surviving in the dust and misery, hell bent on getting his hand on the book, and hoping to rekindle the power of faith in people for his own ends.<br />That's about it in a nutshell really, there are some other characters of course, and little subplots, and for those familiar with the Book of Eli in the Bible itself, there are some obvious connotations added, but these are never overplayed.<br />I want to talk about the film itself for a second and the camera work and CGI, the Blu-Ray transfer is as crisp as I have seen, and they have made this World so believable and real on screen, you can almost taste the dust. The heavily tinted camera work adds depth, and a grey despair to the whole movie, which arguably would have much flatter without it. The story itself is clever, if a little unbelievable at times, and is much more stylized than other movies of the genre, but it feels right for this movie. The acting is great from everyone, even another little cameo for Tom Waits (always a joy to watch) is great.<br />Not a movie for repeat viewing I fancy, once you know the end, have lived the "journey" and got to the twist in the tale, but nonetheless a very good movie.<br />Plenty of action pads out the more thoughtful aspects of the film, as Denzel is a sort of machete wielding one man army, as if possessed by a higher power (again the nod to religion) in his single minded of purpose, and unyielding journey.<br />I knocked off half a star (maybe unfairly) for the frequent, "is he or isn't he?", "how did he do that", "how come they......" aspects of the movie, but I guess some poetic license by the Director is not all bad.<br />Very impressive, visually stunning movie. 4.5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Somebody drops the big one.  All that remains are rusty cars, broken freeway overpasses and matte paintings.  There are two groups of people, healthy and not so healthy and the usual assortment of bandits who look like the guy with the ammunition belts at the end of Raising Arizona.  The "twist", if you can call it that, is that the hero is carrying a book.  Now, in case you really cannot guess instantly what book it is, the title of the movie is "The Book Of..."  Still not sure?  Well, it turns out, the book guides Eli and shows him a path to follow.  So, is it (a) Playboy's Party Jokes, (b) How To Use Your Kenmore Washer or (c) the Bible?  I'm not going to give it away, sorry.<br /><br />Things plod along, and towards the end, Eli is forced to part with the book.  He reaches his destination without the book and then, you will never, never guess what happens, unless you saw Farenheidt 451, maybe 40 years ago.  So things really rest with Denzel, who as usual, is very good and how much you want to read into all this.  I suppose it could be very inspirational if you can avoid getting bogged down by having seen it all before.  Then again, maybe that's what the book is trying to say.  You may think you've invented something new but its all been done before.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Eli (Washington) is a man on a mission in a post apocalyptic world. He is led by a voice that told him to find the last copy of the Bible and to bring it West. Along this treacherous path he encounters hijackers, cannibals and a Warlord named Carnegie (Oldman). The book, Carnegie believes is a weapon that strikes at the heart of man. It will give him the words he needs to control them and expand his power. Eli will stop at nothing to protect the book and bring it to where man still has hope! The forces of good and evil clash again over the oldest story ever told.<br /><br />The story is effective and the acting is great. Washington is so believable in his roles, which is only further complimented by Oldman. Suprisingly Kunis does a good job as Solara! The story is fluid and poignant. I was interested from start to finish. I strongly recommend a viewing.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A strong transfer, although the colors are muted intentionally to advance the feel of a post apocalyse world. A strong audio mix really let's out the BOOM! SPECIAL FEATURES: An excellent array of extras here that provide insight to the storyline and making of. FINAL VERDICT: WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>The Book of Eli is a vastly underappreciated film that mixes martial arts swordsmanship, a post-apocalyptic setting, and a biblical narrative.<br /><br />A war, over thirty years ago, killed off many people in the United States. Others were blinded from the blast.  This creates an interesting disparity between those over thirty years of age who received an education and those under thirty who know nothing of the modern world (at one point, one of the thugs asks, "What's a television?").<br /><br />This is an unpleasant world. Cannibalistic brigands ambush unwary travelers, identifiable by their shaking hands. Water is at a premium.  Batteries are hard to find.  The Book of Eli makes it clear that there's no currency, only barter.<br /><br />Roaming the land is Eli (a subdued Denzel Washington), carrying a book with a cross on it.  This book is greatly desired by Carnegie (a greasy Gary Oldman), who is also old enough to remember the power such a tome can have over the people.  While Eli has been wandering for thirty years in pursuit of such a destination, Carnegie has been sending illiterate henchmen to retrieve every book he can find.  The encounter between the two has all the fire and brimstone of a battle between heaven and hell.<br /><br />Thrown into the mix is Solara (played beautifully by Mila Kunis, who finally sheds her trademark accent), a young, attractive girl who has grown up under Carnegie's protection but, as she flowers into womanhood, is about to become a bargaining chip, a piece of meat, and a lure.  When there's no one left to protect her, she becomes a wanderer in Eli's footsteps.<br /><br />From a religious point of view, it's educational to understand who Eli was in the Bible. In the Bible, Eli's children are cursed for behaving wickedly, a parallel for the war that destroyed civilization in the movie. God's curse assures that all men will "die by the sword" - in the movie Eli expertly cuts a bloody swath through his enemies with his machete. In the Bible, it was the job of Eli's sons to guard the Ark of the Covenant - the pact God made with man - just as Eli guards the holy book in the movie.<br /><br />There's a twist ending that's not a twist of all if you read up about Eli in the Bible. But don't - watch the movie, then do some research, then watch the movie again.  Like Eli's quest for spiritual fulfillment, the experience will be rather eye-opening.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Sorry, but this one just tries too hard to be hip and cool. From the overblown filter effects to the oh-so-epic shots of Denzel silhouetted against the sky, it's all overdone. The only real saving grace here is Oldman, enjoyably quirky as usual. But Kunis is ridiculous, barely an actress but real good at waltzing around post-apocalypse with her perfectly coiffed LA salon hairdo flowing in the breeze. Give me a break.<br /><br />Washington is solid as ever, no complaints there, but he really just doesn't have much to work with here in terms of script. The occasional sword and gunfight, a few long walks down the scorched road, a cannibal here and there, it's all good. Or not. And I hate movies that feature rape scenes or even threats of them, just to justify yet another revenge killing. So easy and so manipulative, and such lazy film making. The biblical overtones are barely explored, and poorly when they are. It's all a bunch of gobbledygook in the end and only Oldman made it worth watching for me after about 45 minutes.<br /><br />And what's up with the dynamic range on blu-rays and dvds lately? You can barely hear the dialogue and then suddenly BOOM BOOM BOOM!!! Huge gunshots or whatever crush your eardrums and you're grasping for the remote to save your brain when suddenly you can barely hear everyone talking again. I don't want to ride shotgun on the remote the whole movie. Use a limiter and do us a favor, or at least have a track with optional compression, because we're hearing too many guns and not enough words lately.<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but hardly fabulous, and when compared to its much worthier apocalyptic brethren, especially The Road Warrior (which has a perfect blu-ray transfer and looks better than this over-filtered sepia mess despite being made three decades earlier), Eli is merely a footnote.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Book Of Eli" is great! This is how the story goes: In the not-too-distant future, some 30 years after the final war, a solitary man walks across the wasteland that was once America. Empty cities, broken highways, seared earth--all around him, the marks of catastrophic destruction. There is no civilization here, no law. The roads belong to gangs that would murder a man for his shoes, an ounce of water... or for nothing at all.<br /><br />But they're no match for this traveler.<br /><br />A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize. Driven by this commitment and guided by his belief in something greater than himself, Eli does what he must to survive--and continue.<br /><br />Only one other man in this ruined world understands the power Eli holds, and is determined to make it his own: Carnegie, the self-appointed despot of a makeshift town of thieves and gunmen. Meanwhile, Carnegie's adopted daughter Solara is fascinated by Eli for another reason: the glimpse he offers of what may exist beyond her stepfather's domain.<br /><br />But neither will find it easy to deter him. Nothing--and no one--can stand in his way. Eli must keep moving to fulfill his destiny and bring help to a ravaged humanity.<br /><br />The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also produced) (as Eli) & Gary Oldman (as Carnegie) is great! The directing by The Hughes Brothers (Albert & Allen) (both of them also directed "Menace II Society" (1993, both also co-produced and wrote the story), "Dead Presidents" (1995, both also produced and wrote the story) & "From Hell" (2001, both also executive produced) is great! The story & screenplay by Gary Whitta is great!<br /><br />The music by Atticus Ross is great! The cinematography by Don Burgess (who also did the cinematography to "Forrest Gump" (1994), "Contact" (1997), "What Lies Beneath" (2000), "Cast Away" (2000), & "The Polar Express" (2004), all which were directed by Robert Zemeckis), "Spider-Man" (2002), "Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines" (2003), & the upcoming "Priest" (2010) is great! The film editing by Cindy Mollo is great! The casting by Mindy Marin (who also did the casting to "Up In The Air" (2009), the upcoming "Tooth Fairy" (2010) & "Repo Men" (2010) is great! The production design by Gae S. Buckley (who also did the production design to "Open Range" (2003) is great! The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr (who also did the art direction to "The Last Samurai" (2003) is great! The costume design by Sharen Davis (who also did the costume design to "Devil In A Blue Dress" (1995, which also starred Washington and Jennifer Beals), "Antwone Fisher" (2002), "The Great Debaters" (2007), "Out Of Time" (2003), all which also starred Washington), "Ray" (2004), "The Pursuit Of Happyness" (2006), "Dreamgirls" (2006) & "Seven Pounds" (2008) is great!<br /><br />This is a great action film that is a little different than other action films. This is a different looking film that people aren't probably used to. Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman are excellent as usual.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Having missed this at the theater, I was happy to be able to stream this from Amazon.  The grittiness of this film pulled me in from the very beginning.  The post apocalyptic wasteland that Eli travels through gives the film a cutting edginess, as does the action.<br /><br />Top notch acting, and an intriguing story.  It was the ending that really took me by surprise, so much so I ended up watching this a second time wondering how I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />One of the best films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />"I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see."<br /><br />One premise of the film is interesting to ponder:  can faith be the cause of an apocalypse?  or is it the source of salvation?<br /><br />"Both thorns and thistles shall bring forth, for us, for out of the ground we were taken for the dust that we are... and to the dust we shall return."<br /><br />Eli did fight the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith.  It's up to us to decide if that's a good thing, and if it matters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>While 'The Book of Eli' will certainly seem familiar at times to those who remember 'The Road Warrior', 'The Book of Eli brings enough new to the table to carve out a nice spot for itself among other post-apocalyptic films. Denzel Washington is in top form here in this smart action film with a lot of heart and soul.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that I didn't see the end twist coming which is a rarity for me, especially considering the clues that are dropped throughout the film. Of course, it's easy to see once you've seen it. The film has a slick look with a very narrow color scheme giving it an almost sepia tone or black and white look at times. This is a good thing because it makes you focus on the story and not a lot of parlor tricks.<br /><br />I can not recommend this film enough for action fans who want a little more than explosions and senseless violence. The only reason I'm giving this 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the story wasn't all that original despite having some nice twists.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For those who were unable to suspend their disbelief (or more importantly, their common sense) regarding the many implausible moments in 'The Book of Eli', let me say unequivocally that I am with you! However, let me explain why I gave this film a '3' out of '5' (or 5 out of 10 on Imdb) despite finding the whole thing quite hokey. First of all, there are many films that are far worse than this one; secondly, I thought that the cgi effects and set design were actually quite good, especially the way in which the filmmakers created their 'equivalent' wild west post-apocalyptic town; and finally, the film actually has engendered a great deal of internet postings defending the many absurd, implausible ideas and scenes utilizing all kinds of tortured reasoning, which I found quite enjoyable to read!<br /><br />The Hughes Brothers have come a long way since their urban crime drama, Menace II Society. They have proved they can proffer up a post-apocalyptic shoot-em-up as good as any mainstream director. Taking a cue from M. Night Shyamalyn's 'Sixth Sense', not only do they know how to dispatch (i.e. 'off') the bad guys in a multitude of creative ways (hands chopped off, cross-bow shootings, one gunshot take downs, etc.), they also can throw in all kinds of clues, pointing to the fact (SPOILERS AHEAD--DON'T READ IF YOU WANT THE TWIST ENDING SPOILED FOR YOU) that Denzel Washington (Eli) has been blind all along. How exactly is Eli able to kill all those biker dudes (first with a knife and later with a gun) without being able to see them? The answer, of course, is in the 'book' itself. Wouldn't you know it, but the Book of Eli begins with a 'B'; yep, shock of all shocks, it's THE BIBLE!!! Channeling 'Ben Hur', the Hughes Brothers make the argument that miracles can be found even in a post-apocalyptic world! Like the Apostle Paul, Eli's 'faith' allows him to miraculously survive multiple onslaughts, including a bullet direct to the gut by bad guy Carnegie.<br /><br />The warmed-over Christian shibboleth that miracles occur due to 'belief in faith alone' is just another canard where we must suspend our disbelief in order to enjoy this film. But there's one small problem. Eli has been carrying one copy of the Bible that he's been trying to memorize for years, and it's in Braille!!! Since the Bible in Braille would consist of many heavy volumes, this is one plot point which even some of the most fanatical defenders of the film, have trouble explaining away.<br /><br />There are other moments in 'Eli' which I still had a lot of trouble explaining away myself. What about Eli walking around for days after having stocked up with only a canteen of water? All the copies of the Christian Bible have been burned but copies of the Jewish Bible and Koran end up on the library shelf at Alcatraz? And how exactly did he escape from the room when Carnegie and his thugs lock him up? I guess Eli finds a 'way' because all those who believe in God, manage to do so.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most weakest ideas in 'Eli' is Carnegie's belief that obtaining the Bible will enable him to extend his power. Since he and Eli are only a few of the people who actually have heard of The Bible, why does he assume that introducing it to the post-apocalyptic survivors will enable him to bring them under his fold? Since the majority of people in the new world have little or no knowledge of prior literature, Carnegie could have wrote his own book which he could have used to sway the masses. Of course, somehow the Bible is supposed to have some kind of a mystical, intrinsic power (perhaps rays emanating from the book itself) which leads Carnegie to believe he can use it as a brainwashing tool. Since it's never demonstrated how Carnegie could become more powerful by getting hold of The Bible, the stakes are never high enough for us to care whether Carnegie gets the book or not. Now if Eli knew the location of a nuclear bomb, that's a Macguffin that I could believe Carnegie would want to get his hands on!<br /><br />There seems little doubt that the most completely miscast actor in 'The Book of Eli' is Mila Kunis. She seems so out of place in this film that her performance actually drags the film down a notch or two. USA Today film critic Claudia Puig couldn't have said it better about Kunis in her film review: "Vacuous and far too glam, she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial." Didn't anyone find it a bit ridiculous how Solara (Kunis) suddenly acquires Eli's amazing martial arts-like skills and takes down most of Carnegie's henchmen in one of the final scenes? Denzel also has become painfully one-note in many of his recent film roles as a middle-aged actor.<br /><br />Finally, I'd like to chime in on the controversy as to whether Eli has converted to Islam when he arrives on 'Alcatraz Island'. A Muslim is not allowed to read any religious book except the Koran, so when Eli dresses up in a white robe as he translates the Bible, I think the Hughes Brothers were suggesting that all along he was some kind of post-apocalyptic Essene. Just my interpretation!<br /><br />I would like to thank all the faith-based defenders of 'The Book of Eli' along with all those who employ tortured reasoning to explain all the ridiculous goings-on in this film. Without you, I would never have enjoyed this film as much as I did and given it a passable rating.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Though the film is based on the original script by first-time writer Gary Whitta, the mood and atmosphere of "The Book of Eli" feels more like that of a Western or a graphic novel. Some viewers may think the film's premise is similar to that of the 2009 film "The Road," but unlike the Cormac McCarthy adaptation and its grim realism, action-packed "The Book of Eli" aims more for entertainment, but not in the same way as the "Mad Max" series did years ago. And the film's story itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief, its ending in particular.<br /><br />Set in the bleak world of post-apocalyptic USA, "The Book of Eli" follows the tale of a lone man (Denzel Washington) travelling across the country, carrying a certain book. Not much is known about him - except he has been wandering for 30 years and that to protect the book, he is ready to fight and kill. And he is very good at that.<br /><br />The man arrives at a town dominated by a local mobster Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie has a monopoly on the town's water that is still uncontaminated after the global disaster. He is looking for a book to consolidate his status as ruler of the community, and he is going to have it no matter what it takes.<br /><br />"The Book of Eli" is directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, known for "From Hell," adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Their inspiration comes from many sources - Segio Leone, for instance. Eli's fighting style looks more like a swordsman's. It is fast and deadly.<br /><br />With the cast including Ray Stevenson, Tom Waits, Jennifer Beals and Michael Gambon and its impressive visual sense, "The Book of Eli" succeeds in what it sets out to do, Post-Apocalyptic Western action.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely fantastic. My eyes and mouth were wide open the whole way through it. This one will surely be a classic one day. I guarantee it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>By now, I'm sure every fan of the Fallout video games knows that the book Eli (Denzel Washington) is protecting is the Wasteland Survival Guide, while every Christian thinks it's the bible.  The Book of Eli is on the surface a great action thriller, but a major bummer of a movie in terms of its view on humankind.  It's like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307476308">The Road</a> but only it assumes humanity requires religion in order to be civilized, a point I personally despise and disagree with vehemently.  Nevertheless, if we can pretend that in this little fictional futuristic world the word of god is imperative, else we all become cannibalistic sociopaths, then the Book of Eli can be forgiven.  I on the other hand will take its fundamentally preachy storytelling into account as a stern critic. For those reasons, the movie bothered me deeply.<br /><br />The year is 2043 and the world has been a post-apocalyptic nightmare for thirty years.  Tribes roam the wasteland raping and pillaging while Eli (Washington) "goes west" with his book in his backpack and divine intervention as his protection.  Along the way he meets sexy Mila Kunis, whose acting is just above modeling; big old mean Ray Stevenson, who naturally rules every scene he is in; Tom Waits, one of my favorite musicians who becomes a futuristic tinkerer; a blind Jennifer Beals, who, like most women here is constantly the damsel in distress; and of course the always awesome baddie Gary Oldman, who does his very best Jack Nicholson while still piecing together some seriously cool villainy.  Obviously there are major spoilers here so I'll keep somewhat restrained, but Oldman's character is bent on finding the bible and using it to control civilization, while Eli hears voices that tell him to bring it elsewhere, and use it for better purposes, I guess.<br /><br />Other than my huge gripes with some of the film's messages and altogether pessimistic assumptions of human individualism, I think this was a very good movie.  The action scenes are state of the art, the sound editing is not flawless but still works, the art direction and cinematography are exactly what I want to see in this kind of movie, and the soundtrack works extremely well with everything else.  The performances of Stevenson, Oldman, and of course Denzel, are all great within this kind of movie, and maybe even a little bit beyond those expectations.  Microcosmically and more specifically in terms of its dialogue, the screenplay is also worthy of some praise.  I can even say that the unlikely twists at the end were both unpredictable and effective, however the final few seconds of the movie were not only unnecessary but actually kind of silly and out of place.<br /><br />It's a good all-around package, but if there is a niche audience hoping to see bloody machete/gun fights and some good old fashion bible-thumping, then it is going to be absolutely awesome for them.  In fact, all those Church groups that got together to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JNNDGA">The Passion of the Christ</a> should reunite for some more gore and god.  The Book of Eli requires faith in god and belief in the bible to enjoy what it is fully.  I'm not so sure I can give it more than a mixed review altogether though, because if I'm troubled by these messages I can only begin to imagine what others more critical of the institution of religion might actually think.  I'd simply like to think it's much more than the authority of the bible which makes us less primal than animals.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>For me, this film was well put together, the story was good,<br />the direction was sharp (The Hughes Brothers have proven<br />themselves to be capable and astute directors who show<br />amazing range and diversity at directing various film genres).<br />Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and all of the supporting cast<br />turned in solid believable performances, there was lots<br />of action, brutal fight sequences, explosions, there are<br />even some comical moments. There's also a revelation<br />towards the end which will take you by surprise if<br />you weren't paying attention throughout the film.<br />I didn't go into this movie with any lofty expectations,<br />or comparing it to other post-apocalyptic fare, I just<br />took it for what it was worth and I was entertained.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good<br />story, good acting, action, and ultimately, entertainment.<br />If you are the type of person who expects every movie to<br />be "Citizen Kane" or like to pick every flaw in a film<br />apart, or have to compare it to something in the same<br />genre for it to make sense to you, then you probably<br />should skip this one!  (-:</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>THE BOOK OF ELI<br /><br />STARRING: Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Jennifer Beals, Ray Stevenson, Evan Jones, Tom Waits and Malcolm McDowell<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Gary Whitta<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action<br />Release Date: 15 January 2010<br />Review Date: 18 March 2010<br /><br />Ever wonder what a religious post apocalyptic western would look like? If you have, then The Book of Eli is it. If you haven't - see it anyway. You'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The sensational Denzel Washington stars as Eli. He's a lonely drifter wondering the streets of a morally and economically abandoned America. After a great war that tore a hole in the sky and upset the balance of the sun, the world more or less came to an end.<br /><br />That was over 30 years ago and Eli has been walking ever since. He, like those few who survived, cannot go outside without shades on; as the sky has turned to a desolate burnt mass that will blind you. The brilliant filmmakers (Albert and Allen Hughes) who brought us From Hell; have crafted a very unique and appealing-to-the-cinematic-eye, landscape for Denzel's character to trek across.<br /><br />Eli has one mission: to protect a sacred book that he has in his possession, and to take it west. Faith is his employer; faith in the heavenly voice that has told him to do so.<br /><br />Please don't make the ignorant mistake that others have made by assuming that it has taken him 30 years to walk from A to B. His path has been unknown to him, as is all of ours in life, and those 30 years were spent with him learning from and experiencing things of which the film does not need to show us. Plus, his path leads him to a place where he interacts with certain characters that would not have been there 30 years ago or even 15 years ago, and he needs to meet them in order for his destiny to be fulfilled entirely.<br /><br />This is a very religious film, if you didn't pick up on it from the beginning of this review or from the advertising. Eli is being led by God, okay. I know it's a movie, but films of the past have asked us to accept much more unbelievable elements and we all have; so just go with it and have some fun.<br /><br />Eli is met along the way by sadistic motorcycle gangs and rapists and thieves; really bad guys. People butcher and slaughter one another for food, water, sex and whatever else you may have to offer them. Eli partakes in none of this, and handles those who oppose his goal appropriately to his situation and to the genre of this film - he kills them; violently, innovatively, and in very entertaining ways.<br /><br />If you are some-one who believes strongly that violence is never the answer, no matter what the situation, then skip this film and go watch Sesame Street instead. It's jam-packed with violence; justified violence. Let's face it - sometimes the only way to counter violence, is to retaliate with even more of it. That's a fact folks.<br /><br />Eventually Eli stumbles into a town run by a heinous dictator. Who better to play a grizzly villain, than the villain's villain himself: Gary Oldman. From Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Fifth Element, to True Romance and The Professional, Oldman has portrayed some of the most celebrated movie-psychotics of all time. He adds The Book of Eli to that list with another phenomenal performance as Carnegie.<br /><br />Carnegie is the guy you have seen a thousand times in different westerns; the bully who has taken over the town and has his own personal henchman, and is forcing a beautiful woman to be his love interest. But it's the sadistic charm that Oldman brings to this character that sets him apart from others. He is magnificent and terrifying.<br /><br />Carnegie's agenda is to get his hands on a sacred book that he believes will grant him power to rule everyone left alive on our miserable planet. The book is of course the one which Eli possesses.<br /><br />When Eli wonders into Carnegie's town for supplies, he finds some trouble. After a bloody battle is had, leaving Eli victorious, Carnegie is impressed with his skills and wishes to hire him as part of his crew. When Eli refuses, Carnegie grants him a free night in his hotel with a generous meal, in hopes of persuading him. Eli accepts the offer and stays the night.<br /><br />Jennifer Beals gives a terrific performance as Claudia, that woman being forced into Carnegie's life that we discussed earlier. Her daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) is forced to work in the saloon and sometimes provide sexual favors to guests. Carnegie forces her to offer herself to Eli, in one of the film's best and most enduring scenes.<br /><br />Obviously, Eli declines her gesture and befriends her instead. The two create a strong partnership and flee from Carnegie and his group of degenerate dirt-bags. Naturally they follow, and several interesting interactions are had before the film reaches its end.<br /><br />The violence in the film will no doubt confuse many, as that's all they will see it as. They will miss the fact that Eli is on a quest from God, and never once invites an altercation upon himself. Eli is always grief stricken or warn-down by his acts of violence and finds no pleasure in them.<br /><br />There is one scene in the film where he does kill an unarmed man, but I believe that he either does this because God tells him to, as the guy is evil and will murder others as he has just attempted to do to Eli; or he does this because of the simple fact that the man will bleed to death, in the middle of no-where, as a result of the injury he has sustained.<br /><br />You'll be impressed to know that Denzel did al of his own stunts in this film, and trained severely to make these action sequences look believable. They do.<br /><br />The Book of Eli also has one of the most original endings ever seen in any film; right up there with the shock-value of The Sixth Sense. Watching it a second time, makes it as equally painstakingly obvious with clues, but hardly anyone will ever catch it the first time around.<br /><br />It's good to see a big Hollywood-backed movie that evokes a strong Christian theme. You don't catch too many of those. Eli gives a terrific quote in the film that has and will continue to stick with me: "There's always a choice."</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>If you were born Mormon, the Book of Eli comes close to describe the Mormons' escape to the west to establish their identity. The only difference was that Joseph Smith believed that people turned black on the first day of the last millennium due to their sins. This movie made a black man the only survival who could recite the Holy Book and preserve it from extinction. The movie replicated the Islamic depiction of the preservation of the Quran by a black man after the death of the prophet. At the end of the movie, the producer did not miss placing the Bible next to the Quran on the same shelf.<br /><br />The chaos that ensued between wars that turned humans into illiterate, belligerent, and ruthless species embodies the turmoil that prevailed in both Mecca, when the Quran was inspired by Muhammad, and Pennsylvania, where the immense space and vast land inspired Joseph Smith to write his own Bible. Eli recites the same shadow of the Holy Ghost that inspired in him the Holy words. Those words kept Eli alive in the `valleys of death' that dominated the land after the wars.<br /><br />The movie dwelled on the classic gray and brown colors to convey the somber predicaments of a human race struck by loss of its intellectual leaders, statesmen, army, and police. The guns, knives, and arrows became the essential tools of warding off ruthless muggers, killers, and robbers. While poverty, illiteracy, and diseases struck the masses, the written words retained their esoteric power to subdue the illiterate, diseased, and desperate wars' survivors. Without the submission of the masses to few men of knowledge, chaos perpetuates disasters, and civilization regresses to the dark ages. Water became the most precious commodity. People ate the flesh of their fellow humans.<br /><br />As Muhammad migrated to the North of Mecca to revive the Quran and escape persecution, Smith and Eli migrated West to resurrect the Holy Bible. Faith kept Eli walking on the roads for thirty years to his destiny in San Diego where he found the right folks who could scribe his Holy words.  Eli rests in piece after his mission was accomplished. One major glitch was that Eli killed too many people in order to survive to deliver his Holy book to the hands that could preserve it. Muhammad on the other hand never wrote the Quran, but rather lived and taught the Quran to transform stray followers to the right path. Muhammad was illiterate but his words and deeds subdued the most influential figures in Mecca and Medina including those who recorded the Quran after Muhammad's death. Returning to Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon got Smith killed for his failure to proved the real evidence of the source of his revelation.<br /><br />Eli's prophecy holds credence on the basis of its high probability, viewed in the context of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of governments that lack the scrutiny of the people it governs. The Anthrax scare that caused the loss of few lives has never been traced to its roots despite its occurrence in the center of the American government and its highly sophisticated laboratories. Nor could any reasonable person deny that all governments cover up on their internal failure and corruption. When mass destruction ensues, figures like Eli would fit the role perfectly. His swift action, lack of trust, and faith in destiny saved him in the final days of judgment.<br /><br />The Saturday show when the movie opened, the theatre was fully packed. Only one woman with her 10 year old exited as the gruesome scenes of murders kept coming. The classic art, the biblical notion, the richness in action and killing, attracted many viewers. Of course, Stalin's book was displayed to show the need for a mass murderer that could bring chaos to order. Kentucky Fried Chickens ' wet towels and another commercial gum also capitalized on the advertisement opportunities of the big name Eli.<br /><br />The modernization of the "Message" by Anthony Quinn, in a cowboy epic of highly powered guns, explosive, destruction, excessive murder, and very rich artistic sceneries made the movie appeal to the short attention span of the contemporary generation.<br /><br />It is all about the BOOK, the Holy words, and the power of conviction that civilization rises and falls.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this film.  It is a simple, moving story about post-apocalyptic life with a protagonist who through his faith manages to bring a particular faith to others who may otherwise not have it.  I'm not going to say much more  because I do not want to spoil it for others who have as yet to see it.  What I will end with is that there are no "Holier than thou" or overly preachy elements in the film The Book Of Eli, yet it is an easy (faith wise), beautiful and poignant film... beautiful musical score too.

Mr. Washington is framed perfectly by the self-conscious cinematography and directing.  Some would go so far as to call them clich&eacute;d but I would call them iconic.  The writing is sloppy in parts* but the theme of duty, devotion and love of God powers through the rough patches.  Recommended.<br /><br />* E.g., SPOILER ALERT how does Mr. Washington escape from his jail cell or Solara escape from the cave or survive the crash of the Road Warrior vehicle when everyone else dies; how is it that Mr. Washington has been traveling west for 30 years but never made it to San Francisco?</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I thought this was a good post-apocalyptic tale.  The story hinges on Eli who is traveling west with a sacred book, which is coveted by the evil Gary Oldman who runs a wild west type of town.  The casting choices are good, and the script was solid.  The action was also very good.  The big reveal at the end was okay but didn't blow me away.  Something about the movie didn't quite grab me the way I thought it would.

Yea, I know Denzil Washington is in it, it has to be good; that's what I thought and that's why I viewed this film.  After I watched this DVD, my thought was then "what in the world possessed Denzil to make this film?"  Bottomline: skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>MAJOR, MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, BUT IT'S WAY DOWN LOW....<br /><br />"If you plan on seeing this movie, do not tell anyone...."<br />-Roger Ebert, review<br /><br />One can never watch post-apocalyptics without reference to the MAD MAX series, THE POSTMAN, and others I have mentioned in other reviews. People in these worlds are either sci-fi cannibals, communists or anarchist psychopaths.<br /><br />In the first 20 minutes of THE BOOK OF ELI I saw all that and more. Looked awfully familiar. Nearly put me off watching it through...but something kept nagging me, saying this was different. How right that nag was! It even lulled me into thinking the film would be 100% predictable.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />For those too young to appreciate all the films that are paid homage here, it is useless for me to mention any other than what I already did above. In brief: Eli (Denzel Washington, man, what a superhero) is a "walker", a wanderer through a post-apocalyptic world. His mission is to "go west"--and he carries sacred cargo: a Bible, King James Version, the last in the world. We learn from Eli that "after the flash, they were all burned", because many believed the Bible "caused" the "flash". Apparently, it tore most of the ozone away also.<br /><br />Eli demonstrates some survival skills apparently taught to him straight from heaven. In fact, that will be part of my spoiler...be warned. He wanders into a town looking for a recharge for his music storage unit, which is identified as a Fathom 900, not seen since the 1990s. Since I don't know, I'll take the movie's word for it (or rather Tom Waits, who plays the shopkeeper/repairman).<br /><br />Eli encounters Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a sort of Boss Tweed if you can call him that--actually a rotten gang leader who has everyone else do his dirty work. He does not match THE POSTMAN's General Bethlehem, but then, he is a different sort of chap. He discovers Eli has a...THE...Bible. He wants it. At any cost.<br /><br />So far this film is really quite fun with all its homages and one suddenly sees it is purely a kung fu film married to Clint Eastwood's man with no name. But wait! There's more!<br /><br />After becoming entangled with young Solara (the wonderful Mila Kunis) and her blind mother Claudia (a great turn by Jennifer Beals, still beautiful as ever), Eli continues west. Solara follows him, so he has no choice but to let her tag along...shades of Zatoichi, anyone?<br /><br />But wait, there's still more!! After a hilarious visit with cannibals George (Sir Michael Gambon) and his wife Martha (Frances de la Tour) and fighting off Carnegie's pursuit, after some atmospheric K-PAX style music and some sagging monochromatic moments, yet with the best cinematography I've seen in years, Eli and Solara find their way to San Francisco. They are bound for Alcatraz, apparently the place to which God told Eli he must go.<br /><br />Eli has been shot in the belly by Carnegie, but he has the strength to go onward. He has already been forced to give Carnegie the Bible, which is kept locked. Eli is dying, on the way to Alcatraz, and Carnegie has the Bible. You THINK you know what's coming, eh?<br /><br />== SPOILER WARNING ==<br /><br />Carnegie finds he needs Claudia more than ever...because the Bible is in Braille. Eli, it transpires, is blind.<br /><br />Even to the end of the film, it isn't overtly stated, but it is there for those who will notice it. Then the film rushes back into your memory...didn't he see this?...didn't he notice that?...but a blind person could do all those things. It was always vital that no one know Eli was blind. He must have been blinded in the flash or by the sun afterwards.<br /><br />Arriving at Alcatraz, he finds a cultural center which he of course mistakes for a museum (THE POSTMAN homage again). The curator, Lombardi--a great uncredited cameo by Malcolm McDowell--tells Eli they are preserving humanity in order to redistribute it again. In a homage to FARENHEIT 451, Eli tells Lombardi to take a pen and write his dictation. He then dictates the Bible perfectly.<br /><br />As Eli lay dying, finishing his dictation, he is ritually shaved and enrobed in what appears to be a Muslim priest's robe (this is the 2nd reference to Eli being some kind of Middle Eastern Christian; the 1st reference is his Arabic scarf which he trades for water). I cannot figure this part out at all, but it's clear Eli is some kind of post-apocalyptic priest and blind. It was odd because very early we see nestled in his backpack a name tag: "Hi My name is ELI", it says beneath a K-Mart-type logo. In the end, his 'successor' is Solara, who wanders back out as Eli once wandered. She even takes his sword-machete.<br /><br />This film is a ZATOICHI remake after all!<br /><br />I love the power of the Bible in this film. As a theologian, it cuts to the chase: few know what the Bible is, let alone what it says. Even Eli has failed to grasp its context. It has caused trouble before: Carnegie recalls when humankind was enslaved by evildoers using the Bible...which is what he wants to do. The Bible tells us that no one else can even comprehend who Eli is. A simple man, yet the most important man on earth, martyred but not before his job is done.<br /><br />Early in the film, Carnegie gets what he says is "the last shampoo on earth" for his blind girlfriend. I was moved that ELi is the last Christian on earth, albeit a shaky, self-guided one.<br /><br />Eli has the millennia-old set of books in his mind. That is the main power of which I speak. Eli gives the world, once again, the Bible. I love how it is finally printed and nestled in an Alcatraz shelf (showing it is from "Alcatraz Press") between Stone's TANAKH (that is the Jewish/Hebrew Bible--I own one of those) and the Holy Qu'uran. This film is full of such details and savory cinematic moments. Then again, I wondered at the sad fact that they printed the King James Bible and shelved it. No one read it and I didn't see copies being distributed. How sad.<br /><br />And as I said, it is a remake of the ZATOICHI films, and it takes a lot from those incomparable films of the 1960s. See it. Buy it. Do not blink, even during the sagging moments, because that is when Denzel shows the acting he learned from Shintaro Katsu, the original Zatoichi. Don't miss the sword moves, again copied directly from Ichi movies.<br /><br />Most of all, don't miss the true message and symbolism of the Bible this film offers. You can be an atheist and appreciate it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>Great movie. Some may find it slow and its not colorful. A really good story though.

Here food, water, energy and books are hard to come by and every day is a struggle to survive. Eli (played by Washington) is known as a walker, who travels across the country (rather than living in a community) trying to subsist on meagre provisions and fighting off lawless robbers just to get by. He only goes into the communities (one of which that is run by the iron handed Gary Oldman) when he needs to recharge batteries or get extra water. He protects a sacred book which is highly sought after by other unscrupulous people and constantly moves west so that he can share his treasure with someone who may know how to do more good with it.<br /><br />This film had a bleak feel to it at first, with muted colours and lots of ash, but it soon began to feel like a cross between a Mad Max film, an action film (due to Washington's `kick ass' character who is more than capable of looking after himself against some rather unsavoury specimens) and a religious allegory about mans folly's and humanity. This was reminiscent of `The Road' which I saw recently and which is based along similar themes, but I found this films story to be more engaging and more uplifting at the end and much prefer it over the aforementioned film. The acting is pretty decent from all involved and Oldman plays his sneering bad guy role perfectly yet again. There is a good twist in the tale and some issues are raised about mans behaviour without moralising or preaching. Some people seem to dislike this film due to it's religious overtones, but to be honest these are pretty slight and are relevant to the story. All in all this was an enjoyable film and if `The Road' put you off post apocalyptic films, but the premise still intrigues you, then this is well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>My biggest problem was that it didn't talk too much about what the great event was that affected the world so much. Background information would have benefited the story more, but the plotline and acting are pretty decent. Eli does a great job taking care of himself during his journey, though a surprise revelation at the ending shows that Eli is much hardier than he really is. Overall a enjoyable flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>Of the two post-apocalyptic movies released in the last year -- "The Book of Eli" and "The Road" -- I think I enjoyed "Eli" much more.<br /><br />That's because it plays almost like a Twilight Zone episode -- or the first "Planet of the Apes" movie, written if my memory serves me by Rod Serling -- with a neat twist (or two or three) at the end.<br /><br />"Eli" is beautifully photographed in bleak shades of brown, and it features an excellent cast, with splendid turns by Denzel as the bad-ass survivor on a sacred mission, Gary Oldman as the villain Carnegie, and Mila Kunis as, well, the eye candy (and eventually Eli's companion on his journey).<br /><br />The fight scenes are topnotch as well, and not too bloody, considering the amount of carnage.<br /><br />I have deducted a star only because of the absence of extras on the DVD.  This practice must stop!  Presumably the studio will release an enhanced version in five or ten years featuring the extras that should have been included from day one.<br /><br />So you might want to rent this or borrow it from your public library first.  And buy it when the "deluxe" edition finally and inevitably hits the shelves.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a much better film than the grumpy critics allowed, but my favorites, Ebe and Gliebe (Roger Ebert and Owen Glieberman) liked it, and my faith in the opinions of those esteemed gentleman was again rewarded.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Faith or Nothing!<br /><br />Denzel Washington is amazing as a wanderer, who's been walking the roads for the last thirty years heading west, a man on a mission.  What's the goal?  Even he is not sure.  Just that he'll know it when he sees it.  He carries the book in his bag and protects it at all costs.<br /><br />The world is a rough place after the bombs dropped.  The giant crater holes, the broken fragments of Man's civilization to where people have degraded to biker gangs and every person for themselves.<br /><br />Only the older men and women who are literate have any hold on anyone else.  Books were burned and banned soon after the war to "prevent this from happening again."  Clearly a Fahrenheit 451 reference.  Keep the people ignorant and they can be more easily controlled.<br /><br />Gary Oldman plays a guy who is running a town where he knows this is true.  He gets his biker gangs to go out and search for the book.  The Book that will get him control over the masses.  Using the words from the Bible will get him to raise up and take control over the cities in his area.  From history it is not the first time that faith in the Bible and religion has led to control over populations.<br /><br />But the film is not saying that Oldman's character is right.  In fact, the selfless faith is what triumphs at the end.<br /><br />And what an ending there is!  Can't spoil it, sorry.<br /><br />The younger people in the film, the woman that befriends him and others, cannot read and have never learned to read.  The biker gang leaders can't read and they don't care -- they'll kill, rape and steal for a decent barter & trade.  The woman can't read either, but wants to know of the old days.  She starts out as a lousy character, frankly, but then develops into a strong character near the end of the film.<br /><br />The photography with the washed-out colors and the sepia toned landscape and people was wonderfully shot and along with the stark music, gives a depressing yet hopeful mood.<br /><br />Favorite scenes:<br /><br />The silhouette where Denzel is whipping out his blade and slicing and dicing the bad guys, hand flies off, a few gut slices and blood splashes.  Yuk.<br /><br />The stark, barren landscape, the blackened craters.  The sun so bright that everyone has to wear shades (apparently the ozone layer has been wiped out).<br /><br />The old couple in a farm house who have a different taste in meat than most.  :)<br /><br />This is not a religious film.  It's not even a film of having a religion.  It's about knowledge.  The smart, literate ones know the way to rebuild.  The illiterate ones want only to survive.  The stupid, literate ones want power.<br /><br />Will Eli live long enough to see his dream happen?  The ending will surprise you, it clearly is not a pat, predictable story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>This movie is set approximately 30 years after nuclear war devastates the planet. Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KMB6VE">Babylon A.D. [Blu-ray</a>], the United States did not recover. While viewing the movie, I often think that it's very similar to the games "Fallout" and "Badlands" - the future is indeed bleak.<br /><br />People compare it to other Dystopian movies - Mad Max and the like. Well, all post-apocalyptic Dystopian movies will share many similarities, from the dust-shrouded sky to dead vegetation, wandering gangs to small outposts run by the strongest and best armed. "The Book of Eli" does a better job than most. The environment is fantastic and believable, the de-evolution of society and technology dead-on. All colors are muted, almost sepia toned. Everything is gritty and dirty. Shampoo is worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />If you enjoy this genre (post "we killed 'em all, let God sort them out) and low-tech survivalist flicks, then this will not disappoint. It was much better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IWRE3I">The Road (2009)</a> - in story, plot, characters and effects.<br /><br />We don't see crumbling skylines - until the end. We don't explore dead cities. We join Eli at the end of a decades-long journey, and see a glimpse of the possible future.  I could have done without the religious rhetoric and Oldman's character (Carnegie) believing that the book is the answer to everything and the source of all power. Denzel Washington gave a surprisingly good performance outside his "comfort zone", and the sexy Mila Kunis was a believable supporting character. The cast had plenty of other well known actors, from Jennifer Beals to Ray Stevenson, plus a decent supporting cast.<br /><br />Every character was well cast and acted - none seemed out of place (think Matt Le Blanc in "Lost in Space" or John Wayne as Genghis Khan).<br /><br />This is one of those movies I'll watch when I can't think of something else (along with the Resident Evil series!)</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When it comes to films with religious trappings, one of two things usually happens: It either bashes all other religions in favor of the one being espoused, or gets a little too preachy and fawns all over itself.  Book of Eli does neither of those things; instead letting the viewer decide the importance/meaning of the religious undertones.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, Book of Eli focuses on a lone traveler (Denzel Washington) trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic America.  When one day he wanders into a rebuilding community, he is harassed by a man (Gary Oldman) who desires a powerful book that the traveler has in his possession.<br /><br />The plot of this film is okay, though at times predictable and/or slow.  However, there are three areas in which the film really excels:<br /><br />-Acting: Denzel and Oldman both give strong, professional performances, while Mila Kunis proves more than just a pretty face as well.<br /><br />-Imagery: The depiction of a completely desolate, war-torn nation is very powerful and interesting.  You never know what sort of crazy character you might meet next.<br /><br />-Religious Themes: The concept of religion is central to the entire film, but is shown as a potential force for good or evil.<br /><br />Thus, although Book of Eli isn't a masterpiece, it is easily interesting enough to entertain fans of Washington, thriller/action, and heavy thematic material.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_The Book of Eli_ (2010)starring Denzil Washington as the prophet Eli features a world destroyed by war brought on by religion and hate.  Few humans remain left and water has become a scarce commodity.  Many of the humans have resorted to cannibalism and those who attack the wandering Eli are quickly despatched with his savage blade.  Eli enters a town where he is able to teach a young girl about his religious belief and to pray to God.  However, the leader of the town seeks to impose his will upon the people and has been searching for a copy of the Bible so he may use it towards his evil ends (he also seems to enjoy biographies of Mussolini).  Only one copy of the Bible remains in existence and that is the property of Eli who maintains that he must "head West" under the guidance of a voice he has heard "from within himself" so that he may find an appropriate place for the Bible.  A series of massive gun fights ensue and a couple George and Martha (Washington?) are brought into the matter which occurs in an epic showdown between Eli, the girl, George and Martha, and the rest of the gang looking for the Book outside of a white house.  Eli is wounded but the girl manages to escape; however, the leader has managed to attain the Book despite the fact that he has been injured.  Eli manages to head further West with the girl where he encounters a second remaining society.  This society has a library set up and seeks to spread all human knowledge to the world again through its printing press.  The library contains much of Western culture including books by Shakespeare and the music of Wagner as well as Britannica encyclopedias.  Eli tells the girl that he contains the Bible in his heart and begins dictating the entire Bible to an old wisened librarian who eventually is to complete the entire dictation thus preserving forever knowledge of the Bible (which will be set to the printing press).  In the meantime, after trying to pick the lock on his own Bible the leader of the town discovers that the Bible is written in Braile.  He attempts to have his blind mistress read it for him but she refuses.  Eventually the illiterate men of his town are to revolt against their master.  In the meantime, Eli slowly dies of the wound inflicted upon him but not before completing the entire Bible.  In this manner, the Bible and teachings of Christ will be passed on to a future post-apocalyptic generation.  Earlier in the film Eli had noted that in the war of the past books were burned and destroyed with the exception of the Bible.  I feel that this may be a reference to the internet in which books are pillaged and information is ripe for rampant abuse.  At the end of the film, the girl manages to set out back for home carrying her mission from Eli to return home.  I felt this film was spiritually fulfilling a vacuous post-apocalyptic world.  Eli notes that in the world before the apocalypse people had much but did not appreciate what they had.  His personal faith is quite touching in light of the hostility to such faith in the modern world.  The end of the movie explains the importance of cultural and religious preservationism and through the medium of the printing press the Bible and the Gospel of Christ will continue to live on a for a future generation of people.<br /><br />My main criticism of the film is the excessive violence that Eli delivers in brutally killing animals for food and his opponents in battle.  Eli spares none and carries a sharp blade which he uses to torture and kill all his opponents.  I felt that this was somewhat unbecoming in a film about spiritual truth that emphasizes the golden rule.  The harshness and violence of the film detract from the overall message I felt and for this reason I only gave the film 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>I salute the other excellent reviews, this is primarily a short note for those who follow my reviews, including the sub-set, DVDs for intelligent people.<br /><br />Definitely there.

If that's all the movie had been, I probably would have been more or less entertained by it. But no, the movie goes above and beyond the call of duty, and for a movie about a book, it's a pretty solid film.<br /><br />What stuck me most about this film is probably the unique direction and world-building the film does. It's never really told what caused this apocalypse, but this post-apocalyptic world is kind of a beautiful world. The color has a very distinct tone to it, and even though the film mostly takes place in the California desert, the landscape seems very alive and striking. Watching Denzel just walk in front of a broken interstate towering above him is just a cool visual. And since the world is set 30 years after the apocalypse, everything looks it. Roads have a cracked, but dry quality. Cars are rusted, the paint on houses are peeling, and door hinges easily give way. Also, the world, at least as it shows, show society as reverted back to Western times. It's not really overt, but there's certainly the distinct feel of it in the scenes of the town. In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that they didn't go deeper into the world. I want to know what it was like before. What was Denzel like before all this happened. Was he in the condition that he was in before it happened? You can see a K-Mart name tag with Eli's name on it at one point, but other than that, the movie is very specific in its scope. I just loved what they did with it so much, I wanted to see more of it.<br /><br />Also, I've never see The Hughes Brothers at work before, but they have a great visual style. And it's not just the color either. It's the shadows, how they light the fight sequences, the camera angles, what you can hear, when you can hear it, and how it's emphasized. I usually don't notice these technical details when I'm watching a film, but Eli certainly makes it stand out, for the better I think. Certainly, all the crew have promise, and I hope to see great things from them in the future. This includes a special shoutout to screenwriter Gary Whitta, who has never done a movie before this, but comes out with a splendid script for his first effort.<br /><br />But that isn't to say the movie is perfect. I could predict about 75% of the plot fairly easily, and I didn't have much love/use for Mila Kunis until she started blowing crap up. Still, by the end of the movie, they had convinced me that Meg Griffin could in fact be a believable bad-ass. There I said it. I thought it was impossible, but Eli showed me otherwise. Speaking of which...<br /><br />Denzel really is one of the, if not the highlight of the movie as the mysterious, but still thoroughly bad-ass Eli, who has a penchant for cutting off heads with a very sharp blade in the shadows. But it's not just the blade, as Eli is also impressive with a gun. Denzel pulls all the aspects of the character off with ease and coolness, while still being wise as all get out. Also, Gary Oldman is back in full form, channeling the slimy villainy he ruled over in the 90s. The character is a bit too serious, but Oldman makes the best out of the character.<br /><br />And then there's the end. A lot of people won't like it, but I like how it isn't the typical ending you'd expect from a movie like this. Is it believable? It's certainly a leap, but it works for Denzel's character, and makes him an even greater character. Plus, everything is wrapped up pretty nice, so I'll give it that too.<br /><br />Overall, atheists beware, this is a well-done movie that shows promise for everybody involved creatively. It also shows that Denzel is not without hope, Gary Oldman can still be slimy, and Mila Kunis can actually be cool. It's a surprisingly good movie and a satisfying one at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>One does not usually begin a movie review by talking about the ending, but in the case of "The Book of Eli," there's really no other way to go about it. Something, and I'm trying to be careful here, is revealed, something that's implausible but also undeniably clever. After the revelation, we discover what has been driving the main character to do what he does, and that's when it all come crashing down - this movie goes a long way for very little. How could the Hughes Brothers have let their film be so grossly undermined, especially after giving the audience a thoroughly absorbing buildup? I'm so disappointed. This movie could have been something. Up until the end, it really was something.<br /><br />The story takes place in a post apocalyptic world of barren landscapes, effectively made to look harsh through a combination of overly bright lighting and muted color schemes. Broken highways trail across vast deserts. Cities lie in ruin. Ancient-looking cars litter the scenery, and some still contain the remains of their drivers. Drought reigns supreme. Everything is scarce, including food. The remaining population consists almost entirely of thieves, and some have even resorted to cannibalism. The reason for all this is left a little obscure; the characters keep referring to a cataclysmic event known as The Flash, which I interpret as being either a meteor or a solar flare. It also could have been manmade - a nuclear bomb, or something.<br /><br />Wandering across this wasteland is Eli (Denzel Washington), a loner on a mission. He has the fighting skills of an assassin, able to take on groups of people singlehandedly and emerge victorious, even when chainsaws and machineguns are involved. He seems astutely aware of his surroundings, and his sense of hearing is unbelievably strong. He has lightning-quick reflexes, as if somehow seeing everything before it actually happens. But he never makes it his business to fight; he's just trying to head west. He has been for the last thirty years, ever since The Flash took place. What exactly is waiting for him there? He's remains mum on the subject. I can't help but love it when the Mysterious Stranger lives up to his name.<br /><br />He makes a pit stop in a ramshackle town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a wholly deplorable man who sends his flunkies out in search of a very specific book. No power on earth will make me reveal exactly what book it is. I will say that Eli just happens to be in possession of such a book and that, because of a social uprising soon after The Flash, it's the last of its kind. As a result, a select few know of its existence. Eli wants the book because he believes it will be the key to humanity's redemption. Carnegie wants the book because he can use it as a weapon. When all is explained at the end, we realize with great disillusionment that Carnegie's motives make a reasonable argument for why this book should have remained forgotten.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself. Eli bonds with Solara (Mila Kunis), daughter of Claudia (Jennifer Beals), Carnegie's blind concubine. Not much is known about Solara; the most we get is that, like many who were born after The Flash, she never learned how to read. But it's not really about getting to know her, anyway; it's about her relationship with Eli, the way she questions him about life before The Flash, why he's so intent on heading west, and whether or not he can teach her how to read. Eli is alarmingly unresponsive on the subject of reading, and we don't understand why until the end.<br /><br />And that brings me back to where I started. A mystery is only as good as its solution; if what leads up to the ending is better than the actual ending, you've failed at telling a successful story. The big revelation at the end of "The Book of Eli" is immensely unsatisfying, not only because it sends a message that contradicts certain events of the story, but also because it lacks the inventiveness and scope of the film's opening and middle sections. It was a bait and switch. I felt cheated.<br /><br />All the same, there are many recommendable things about this movie. The buildup is carefully structured and wonderfully paced. The visuals are stunning. The dialogue is decent. The performances are good, especially Oldman's. It's just the ending that's bad. This is a strange situation. I'm urging you to avoid "The Book of Eli," but because my review has been so vague, seeing it may be the only way for you to understand where I'm coming from. I really wanted to like this film. Up until the final five minutes, I did like it very much. So maybe it would be worth your while to go and then leave before everything is revealed. In this case, that would not be a waste of money. Trust me on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Book Of Eli directed by The Huges Brothers who also directed Mence II Society which I haven't seen in years I remember it being good though.

Basically to get straight down to the plot there's this guy named Eli he has the last bible in the world in pot apocalyptic 2043. You have this guy Carnegie who want's the bible for manipulation or power I don't know maybe its best I don't know & leave it up to my imagination. Then a girl Solara joins Eli later on basically that's the plot. I felt there were flaws Denzel Washington Gary Oldman deserved better a better actor to work than Ray "Rome if she want to Stevenson 1 funny thing during an action scene he fired a CGI rocket he did the same thing in Punisher Warzone. Carnegie was a airly weak villain but Gary Oldman did a good with what he was given. Denzel Washington gave a good performance I 've never seen Denzel Washington give a bad 1. I thought it couldn've used more action. There was a cool cameo by Malcom McDowell I wish he he could've been in the movie more. I do kind of like the score.

Well-directed by the Hughes Brothers, the movie relies on essential goodness of mankind and an effectively balanced performance by the ever reliable Denzel Washington.  Also the strong support from villains Gary Oldman and Ray Stevenson; Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals and an uncredited cameo from Malcolm McDowell.<br />The sepia tone enhances the barren landscape and Eli's mysterious secret is well preserved.  One of the better films of this genre in recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington is Eli.  He wanders a post-apocalyptic America with the last copy of a book that has the power to revive a society, a culture and a people for good or, if it falls into the wrong hands, for evil.  Eli wanders ever westward on a quest guided by dreams and visions.  It's a mission he does not fully understand but he knows it requires use of deadly force when necessary and Eli is superbly skilled at exercising his swift, lethal skills.  Here's a remarkable film with a strong, stark, visual style.  So much better than the empty, pretentious and similarly set The Road.  Gary Oldman is the despot who seeks the book for power.  Mila Kunis is a na?ve waif who discovers something greater. Fine direction from the Hughes Brothers and Washington is memorable as Eli - a righteous warrior who "walks by faith, not sight."</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>The world following the apocalypse has become a nearly barren desert, populated by loosely knit groups of humans who cling to survival with dirty talons, and make little effort to cling to civilization.  Many drive modified motorcycles.  Into this desolation wanders a lonely figure, reluctantly on a journey that urges him to disassociate from humanity in favor of headlong movement across the landscape.  He is also a ferocious fighter when he needs to be, and under the hard exterior is capable of feeling a need for companionship and meaning.<br /><br />Nope, I'm not describing THE ROAD WARRIOR.  I'm not talking about THE ROAD.  I'm talking about the very unoriginal THE BOOK OF ELI, starring Denzel Washington as the mysterious man Eli who is compelled to walk ever Westward across a landscape wrecked by nuclear war...where there are few survivors and many of them have turned to cannibalism.  He carries a book with him that is unique in what is left of mankind, and he believes that he must deliver this into the right hands.<br /><br />On his path, he is frequently beset by violence...but fortunately, he has almost superhuman hand-to-hand fighting skills (and a very sharp sword), so that he can easily defeat 6 or more hardened, experienced fighting men in about 20 seconds flat.<br /><br />He wanders into a town, where the self-appointed mayor (Gary Oldman) happens to be looking for the very book that Eli happens to be carrying.  Eli escapes, but is accompanied (much to his chagrin) by a spunk young lady (Mila Kunis) who is drawn to Washington's gentleness and probably by a chance to "see the world."  The two must fight off efforts to bring them back to this town, save the book and deliver it to the location Eli feels God has told him to bring it.<br /><br />ELI is filmed in a washed out, sepia-toned manner, and is virtually devoid of any other color.  There are lots of shots of Eli moving across the barren land, and plenty of moments where he just stands in place and looks cool.  Denzel Washington has charisma to burn, and it is this charisma that makes the film watchable.  We immediately take to this quiet, mysterious man...because we immediately are drawn to Washington.  Washington talks very little, and except for two or three short bursts of action...seems to DO very little.  Yet he's fairly riveting, and that's due simply to his presence.  He doesn't so much give a performance as he gives a persona.<br /><br />Were a lesser actor than Washington in this film, it would just be a slow-moving, sepia colored, B-level post-apocalyptic chore of a movie.  There's very little that's honestly original, and surprisingly little actual action.  I expected more fighting, but got very little when it was all said and done.  Gary Oldman, who has been such a great villain over the years, really never makes much of a foreboding presence.  We get that he's a bit crazy and a lot dangerous, but it feels vague and unspecific.  Surprisingly, Jennifer Beals makes a nice impression as Oldman's "girlfriend" and Mila Kunis' mother.  Kunis is working up an interesting film resume, having been credible now in things as diverse as ELI & FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.  I'm not ready to put her on the A-list yet, but I also never thought the kid who played Jackie on THAT `70s SHOW would have a viable film career.  She's actually pretty good, and towards the end of the film, has some nice moments with Washington which finally give the film a long overdue shot of human emotion.<br /><br />In the end, your enjoyment of this movie will depend a lot on how much you like either a) Washington or b) post-apocalyptic films, no matter how derivative of far better films.  While I didn't mind the time I spent watching THE BOOK OF ELI...my time would have been better spent re-watching THE ROAD WARRIOR...the film that after all these years is STILL the gold-standard in this little subgenre.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>I now have a great film starring Denzel Washington for the first time.  This is by far his best film for me, mainly because it's the only film he's starred in that I loved.  This is a great film, the story comes together and plays out very well, the acting is great and the effects are second to none.  This film truly immerses the viewer into a hellish post apocalyptic world.  Great story telling and film making.</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>Why does it keep asking me if I am over 13? Do Amazon think I might be Benjamin Button and be growing younger, or perhaps I am testament to the education system that Wexford is producing very erudite and splenetic 12 years olds? I digress....<br /><br />"Can I tell you about the word of our Lord"?<br /><br />Is one phrase that thankfully that Eli managed to avoid. The following also does not appear..<br /><br />Washington "Can I interest you in a Watchtower?"<br />Oldman "No thanks, I'm quite happy with my hotel thank you".<br /><br />Its 30 years in the future, the bombs fell, the world ended, nuclear fire blossomed and the fire of the sun scorched the earth. The stunned survivors roamed shooting, gouging and murdering each other, civilisation fell, the wheels of industry stopped turning, and yet still, the roads in The Book of Eli are still in better condition than those we have in Wexford.<br /><br />The world was broken some 30 years previously when some sort of war occurred and probably destroyed the ozone layer causing the world to be flooded with UV light. In the short term, everybody got a lovely tan, but in the long term, everyone who managed not to live underground for a year died. A year?? Who on earth could live underground for an entire year?<br /><br />In the intervening years, the lazy good for nothing folk of Carnegie's town had done nothing at all to tidy up the place, it looked like a ruin, there's no excuse for living in a ruin, its sheer laziness.<br />Eli is wandering around the place lugging a Bible that he reads from lovingly every night, as he listens to his IPod, not you understand, one of those crappy ones that break down after 5 minutes, but one that lasts for 30 years, before he has to recharge it, perhaps it is solar powered or something? Tom Waits was actually tasked with recharging it during the film, but presumably resisted the temptation to load any of his own tunes onto it.<br />The other thing that everyone has is a supply of cool sunglasses, which is great. I don't know how they do it; I lose mine all the time.<br /><br />And the last thing you would probably want to see in the post apocalyptic world is some bloke with a Bible. I mean, thinking about all of the wars caused in the name of religion, the Inquisition, the Crusades, oppression of people and cleric abuse, an outbreak of organised religion would be the last thing I would like to see. And what is the big deal? The folk he meets in the town  could have the following conversation. Observe.<br /><br />Townsman - "Howdee stranger, what have you got there?"<br />Eli "I have a Bible".<br />Townsman "What's that all about then? What happens at the end?"<br />Eli - "Why, Revelations, Armageddon, the end of the world!!!"<br />Townsman (expansively indicating the post apocalyptic landscape) "Seen it already."<br /><br />Anyhoo, Carnegie (Gary Oldman) decides that the bible represents a handbook to dominate and oppress and entirely new market segment, and he might well have been right. You see, the survivors of the apocalypse had destroyed every other copy of the Bible in America, so this is the last one.  Even those Gideon ones. Oldman lives in a town centre hotel, he might like to have checked his bedside table, which would have been ironic if there was one there all the time.<br /><br />Oldman wants the Bible; Washington has a higher calling for it. Shenanigans ensue. There is some chopping, a bit of stabbing, some shooting.<br /><br />In the end, there is an ironic and moderately unexpected twist, which frankly on first viewing is really outstandingly daft, I mean mega daft, but the point of the film is faith, and so you have to take the silly twist on faith as well, which sort of makes it more bearable.<br /><br />I really rather liked the post apocalyptic setting of the film, its well done, the washed out colour and the utter devastation is nicely realised. Oldman and Washington are solid in their performances, the fight scenes are well realised without being graphic, for me, who loves the post apocalyptic genre, this was an enjoyable film, and recommended. Mad Max, it is not. More "Reasonable Max".</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>The Hughes Brothers, Allen and Albert, are not exactly the most prolific writing and directing team working in film. Their last film, "From Hell", is a criminally underrated and poorly timed release starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham in an adaptation of a graphic novel about Jack the Ripper. It was released a few weeks after the 9/11 attacks and was all but ignored. Their new film, "The Book of Eli" is also based on a graphic novel. Despite a few interesting moments and a couple of good performances, the film is nowhere near as successful as their last effort. Given their track record, we have another seven or eight years to see if they hit the mark again.<br /><br />Eli (Denzel Washington) travels alone across a desolate landscape. As he rummages through abandoned and dilapidated homes and walks past the husks of rusted out cars, we quickly get the sense something bad has happened, something big that caused their way of life to change. As Eli makes his way west, we see he has two prized possessions. The first is an old IPOD he has jerry-rigged to a battery, to listen to music, to give himself an escape from the desolation around him. The second is a large leather bound book with a lock and a cross on the cover, a bible which he reads on a nightly basis. One day, he approaches a crumbling freeway interchange and watches as a group of motorcycle bandits quickly overtakes a man and a woman traveling together. They kill the man, take their possessions and begin to rape the woman. Eli watches, trying to decide if he should reach out, if he should get involved and help the woman. He decides to move on. Later, he comes to a town populated by a group of survivors and led by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie lords over his people by controlling the food and water. He also provides alcohol drugs and women to the populous, operating out of a makeshift brothel carved out of an abandoned theater. Carnegie sends his teams out to scour the countryside looking for a book. When Eli arrives, he realizes the bike gang is in the bar and quickly takes them out with his sword and some fancy footwork. News travels to Carnegie and he wants to meet the new arrival. Carnegie wants Eli to work for him, to help him rebuild society. They are both survivors and know what life was like before the war thirty summers ago and they can both read. But Eli declines. Soon, Carnegie learns of Eli's bible, the very book he had been searching for. He sends Solara (Mila Kunis), the daughter of his companion (Jennifer Beals), a blind woman whom he adores, to visit Eli and spend the night with him. But Solara soon realizes Eli is different and might be able to help her escape. They reluctantly team up and continue west. But Carnegie isn't going to give up that quickly.<br /><br />When a film takes place in a different time or reality than our own, it has to work very hard to establish this landscape and to make us believe in everything that is happening. The filmmakers are extremely successful in one regard and less so in another. The landscape Eli travels is bleak, gray and desolate. As he walks through the gray, dressed in an old army jacket and a pair of wrap around sunglasses, nothing he passes looks like it was built recently and this fits extremely well with the back story we learn during the course of the film. A nuclear war happened thirty years ago and the survivors have been struggling to live ever since. People like Carnegie have power because he is able to control things like water and food. Most of the people surrounding people like Carnegie and Eli are younger and many have been born after the war. This means most are unable to read. Because of this, Carnegie realizes the power a bible might have and seeks to find a copy.<br /><br />When Eli first spots the lone couple pushing a shopping basket with all of their belongings, he stops and watches them. The bike gang quickly overtakes them, kills the man and rapes the woman. But Eli just watches from his perch high above, tentatively reaching for his machete. He decides not to interact. Yet, later, he cautiously approaches a woman sitting on the ground next to her overturned shopping cart, apparently unable to move. Why is he reluctantly willing to help one and not the other? Later, Eli talks vaguely about his journey and it seems like he is on a quest. But how can we believe in his quest when he reluctantly agrees to help some, but not others. As we begin to learn more about the extent and meaning of Eli's journey, this double standard becomes even more troubling and problematic to the narrative.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is always good and as Eli he brings the right amount of seriousness and conviction to the role. We get he has a serious goal for his journey and he won't let anything stand in his way. When  he realizes the danger Carnegie presents, he simply walks away, trying to avoid further conflict. Of course, Carnegie can't let it end. When he has to help Solara, he does so reluctantly because it will impede his journey. But we get the sense that some part of his journey might be leading him to provide her with a hand.<br /><br />Washington is an extremely charismatic actor and he is just about always good, even when he appears in films that don't match his skill. Unfortunately, as one of the top stars in Hollywood, he continues to appear in films that don't match his skill. So for every film that reminds us why he is a star with great skill ("Crimson Tide", "American Gangster", "Devil in a Blue Dress"), he appears in an almost equal number of films that give us reason to question his skill ("D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu", "The Siege"). Washington clearly likes to work with the same people (he has appeared in a number of Tony Scott films ("Crimson Tide", "Man on Fire") but I have to wonder why he appears in so many films that don't live up to his ability. Is it the money? Is he anxious to make more films? If so, why doesn't he use his start power to make these problematic films better?<br /><br />Gary Oldman is good as Carnegie, the man who realizes the people, the few survivors, need to believe in something. He also realizes that if he possesses this, he will become more powerful and more legendary. He rules his kingdom with a quiet intensity. It is interesting to watch him interact with Claudia (Jennifer Beals), his blind lover. When the motorcycle gang brings back some shampoo, he eagerly uses it to wash Claudia's hair, thrilled to provide her with the luxury. But when he sees an obstacle in his way, he has no qualms about ordering his men to remove the barrier.<br /><br />Mila Kunis is less interesting as Solara. Carnegie initially orders her to spend the night with Eli and she is clearly not used to fulfilling such requests. But when she realizes Eli is not interested, she pleads with him to simply let her stay the night. If she is sent away, Carnegie won't like it and she will have trouble. Later, when they begin the quest, Kunis seems to be simply moving her character through the emotions. She is unable to really make us believe she shares the same intensity as Eli.<br /><br />Ray Stevenson (HBO's "Rome", "The Punisher: War Zone") plays Carnegie's security. Stevenson is always interesting to watch, he has a certain intensity about him which causes us to watch him, even when he is saying mundane things or unable to contribute to the narrative.<br /><br />There are a couple of interesting action scenes. Early on, Eli is confronted by a motley band of survivors who are looking to score something to eat (cannibalism seems to be common in this time). He gives them a chance, informing them if they continue they won't survive. They laugh and confront him. Eli moves under an old overpass and the entire fight happens in darkness, we are only able to see their silhouettes. He quickly dispatches the group, beheading more than a few of the attackers. In fact, this one scene has more beheadings than I have ever seen in a single film before. The scene is interesting visually and there are a couple of moments like this. But the rest of the film concerns Eli's slow journey across a barren landscape. It feels a bit like someone touched a fast forward button (for the fight scenes) a few times while watching a DVD of the rest of the film.<br /><br />There is a final "ah huh" moment. And it is interesting, but it unfortunately raises more questions and starts to make the viewer look more closely at the rest of the narrative, trying to spot any other problems, holes and poorly constructed bits. When this happens, the film has to be air tight, to withstand such scrutiny.<br /><br />And "The Book of Eli" isn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>Even though I'm an agnostic, I've grown weary of standard Hollywood junk in which religion is portrayed as near evil and religious people as fools.  'The Book of Eli' and a film I just reviewed, 'Frailty', are major exceptions to this general rule.  Eli, although not the returned Messiah, is his prophet in the desert of a ravaged earth.<br /><br />The earth has been savaged by an apolcalyptic war and ignorance rules the land.  He who has pre-apocalyptic knowledge has the potential for great and destructive power and there are those who will kill to learn its secrets.  Eli, in a way similar to the demi-God, Achilles, in the Iliad, has been touched by the eternal and is--unfortunately for his enemies--virtually immune to danger and evil.  He is the agent by which the world may be saved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington does a great job heading West on a post Apocalyptic road. He reads the Bible daily and although he may have to kill others to survive, he keeps his faith true. Gary Oldman is an unscrupulous man that desires the last King James Bible in Washington's possession no matter how he has to get it. He sends gang after gang to retrieve it to no avail. When he finally joins in the hunt he finally obtains it, but sometimes even a well read person can not read what's coming in the way of God's ironic retribution. My only objection to the movie is Washington kills a cat with the same lack of remorse that he dispatches the vultures of society. That scene did not improve the movie except for cat haters which I fully expect to give me negative votes. Basic extras and good quality picture and sound.

It's all shot on digital video, and for once the format looks just right for the gray, washed-out landscapes.  After wasting a bunch of thugs with a wicked long knife/short sword, Denzel wanders into a one-horse town run by a nasty boss-type guy played by who else?  Ben Gazzara.  No, just kidding, but Gary Oldman is channeling him I think.  Heck, I dunno, maybe there's just a generic amoral town boss type and everybody tends towards it if they play these roles enough.<br /><br />Also in the town are Tom Waits as a shopkeeper (entertaining for his few minutes of time but wasted) and Mila Kunis as the daughter of Oldman's blind kept woman, Jennifer Beals.  After Denzel goes all Toshiro Mifune on a bunch of Oldman's men who've just returned from raiding, Oldman takes an interest; and after finding out that Denzel has a precious book, he's even more interested.  You want to guess what the book is?  I don't think you'll find it too hard...<br /><br />This is a rather silly and derivative movie that vacillates between various tough guy genres - post-apocalyptic science fiction, spaghetti western, samurai film.  The after-the-end-of-the-world stuff doesn't come off as much different than what we've seen in dozens of films from A BOY AND HIS DOG through MAD MAX and this past year's THE ROAD - gray deserts, shattered towns and cities, little animal or vegetable life, dust, hopelessness.  The close-in fighting sequences feel like updated Kurosawa, and sharp-eared viewers will note that one of Oldman's henchmen whistles the theme from Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA at a couple of points during the film.  Denzel  is doing the taciturn, emotionless staring type of anti-hero best exemplified by Clint Eastwood in the "Dollars" trilogy, though he brings his own particular kind of charisma and even a certain warmth the role; he and Mila Kunis (somewhat miscast I think but trying her best and looking a bit too lovely in this grimy environment) are certainly the main reasons I saw the film and I can't say I was disappointed in them.<br /><br />Besides all the tough-guy stuff and macho posturing though, the film wants to be - and say - something more.  Problem is that in the resolution (which I'm not going to spoil for ya) that something more has to be taken so literally and absolutely for the film to work that if you don't want to believe it (and it IS a matter of belief) you'll probably just find it all laughable.  And the film doesn't play out for the most part as a comedy - it's a lot more serious than most spaghetti westerns, even solemn at times.  Then again, you could just have fun with Denzel doing Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and any number of other macho action figures and maybe that's enough.<br /><br />On a certain level, though, this film clearly wants to be taken seriously, wants to be something more than just a mindless action romp; the Hughes brothers who directed it haven't exactly shied away from Christian themes in their previous films, and here they are front and center and obvious.  You don't talk so much about religion - the Bible, specifically - if you don't have some kind of agenda.  But it's so damn muddled, and so careful to try to straddle various lines in order to have as wide an appeal as possible that I'm not sure it was worth it.  And in the final analysis, if this guy is carrying around a Bible and the message he's getting is "kill anyone who stands in my way", what does that say about the book, humanity, or this film?</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>A shame and a Waste of Talent pushing this "Left Behind"-esque Protestant Propaganda,Denzel could do way better.<br />The movie is not horrible but it is just pointless and it's been done before(MadMax),A bore.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>Here's the premise...<br /><br />In a post apocolyptic world, Denzel Washington is this mysterious apostle/keeper of the faith who roams around the country heading "west". When confronted, he's practically a superhero who can take on anybody and any amount of attackers. He's carrying around a Bible which is supposed to represent "hope" in this lawless, wasteland of a world. Gary Oldman, on the othe hand, is a power hungry villain who recognizes that the Bible would be an excellent tool in suppressing others, creating fear and justifying existing turmoil. He wants Denzel's Bible.<br /><br />There's two ways to evaluate this loathsome movie.<br /><br />1) As pure entertainment, it's terrible. The movie is, for the most part boring, the combat sequences are overstylish and the plot has no resolution, as though they did not where to go with this. The charactors, dialogue, and themes are preposterous.<br /><br />2) In taking this as a serious metaphor for religion, it's even worse. While I'm not a big fan of organized religion, it can be argued that if this movie was supposed to be a proponent of organized religion, it seriously backfires. This movie paints the use of the Bible in mostly evil terms. Gary Oldman practically spews the Marxian view that "religion is the opium of the masses" in explaining why the Bible would be so powerful in his hands. Even the Denzel Washington charactor, who is supposed to be righteous with his  intentions for his Bible, really does not act as that much of a hero within the film.<br /><br />There's brutality and violence that does not justify a purpose, charactor development on people that end up not being worthy of the development and a ridiculous conclusion.<br /><br />This movie came out around the same time as "The Road", another overly dark, post apocolyptic film. That film, if the "end of the world cinema" is your thing, is far superior since it's more bleak, in a realistic manner and, in a horrifying portayal, examines the mass chaos when a society is broken down (although it a well made film, it puzzles me who would get an entertainment value out of such a really sad and depressing film).<br /><br />If this movie did not have the charismatic Denzel Washington in it, it would not even be worth watching on cable.<br /><br />I would think that the only person that could enjoy this would be either an ardent aethiest or religous zealot.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>This one is a chore to sit through.<br /><br />It is a pedestrian "Road Warrior," in all senses.<br /><br />Two great actors--Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman--are utterly wasted on this near-plotless and eminently pointless mess.<br /><br />Recycling every stale post-apocalypse cliche, the movie adds nothing to the genre, and is DULL.<br /><br />The pacing is glacial. Scene after scene is of people walking, alone, and pausing. Camera-zoom: voila, nothing happens.<br /><br />The scenery is unbelievable; apparently they spent all their money on actors and had none left for special effects. The CGI is bargain-basement and looks like the painted backdrop in a high school play.<br /><br />The lighting is sepia. This isn't really a color movie. This is a brown-and-white movie. Yes, I know the post-apocalypse world is supposed to be bleached and irradiated and scorched (this is why everyone has to wear sunglasses), but the brown tone just makes everything seem out of focus.<br /><br />Denzel Washington underacts. He is stoical to the point of somnolent. Even when he fights (which is a lot), he seems to be just going through the motions. By the way, in the many-on-one fight scenes (which are many), each bad guy carefully waits his turn to be stabbed or gored or pierced or otherwise impaled; none of them has the brilliant idea of ganging up.<br /><br />Gary Oldman overacts. This is painful to watch. He chews more scenery than Al Pacino at his worst.<br /><br />But nothing helps.<br /><br />A dog. A dull dog.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>For years, I've been waiting for The Hughes Brothers to make a good film... and they just keep letting me down. MENACE II SOCIETY had moments of flair and style, but ultimately was not a good film. DEAD PRESIDENTS is one of the most needlessly violent films I've ever seen, and while I appreciate the point it's trying to make, it doesn't make it well. FROM HELL... well, being a comic fan and a devotee of Alan Moore, this film was simply god-awful. And then I saw the trailer for THE BOOK OF ELI, and I thought to myself... COOL! Denzel as a post-apocalyptic wasteland Zatoichi-esque wanderer and Gary Oldman as his nemesis. That seems like the recipe for a really kick-butt film. But... no. They manage to take a really interesting premise and make it convoluted, cliched, inanimate and ultimately dull. The problems that the two stars of the film face the most is that they've played these roles before, and they've played them better. Denzel did the FAR superior MAN ON FIRE and Gary did the FAR superior LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL.<br /><br />What also upsets me is the way that not just this film, but every film that the great Ray Stevenson seems to be in, his talent is just wasted.<br /><br />The film operates under a similar pretense to another superior film, Kurt Wimmer's EQUILIBRIUM, that certain abstract things (in this case, certain 'books') cause death, destruction and war. And what has caused more death and destruction throughout history than religion? Again, if you've read anything on the description of this film, you know that the book Denzel is carrying with him is the last-known copy of the King James bible. And apparently, this bible is giving him a supernatural ability to resist harm and kick serious tail. Denzel's dialogue consists mainly of how he's "being led by faith" or "being guided by God"... old hat. Gary goes for the quiet insane that has bursts of rage and violence. Old hat. The desolate post-nuclear wastes are shot with highly bleached colors. OLD... HAT. How this film becomes even worse is that Denzel gets a kid sidekick. Well, it's twenty-something hottie Mila Kunis, but she has the emotional range of a twelve-year old, so for all intents and purposes, she's a kid sidekick.<br /><br />And the film, near the end, has an O.Henry-like twist that is so incredibly stupid that I had trouble believing that they included it.<br /><br />Another mess by the formerly-promising Hughes Brothers.

The plot is so bare bones that it could have (and should have) been a 10 or 15 minute short film.  The twist is at first shocking and satisfying...but soon fades to "...so what?"<br /><br />I give one star to films I wish I would have walked out of, and this certainly fits the bill.  I started checking my watch about 40 minutes into the movie, and continued to do so every 5 minutes.  It's just not enough entertainment, plain and simple.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>The digital projection in the theatre made this movie, shot in the dark, unwatchable. A mess of logic, belief and genre. What a waste.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>First Impressions:<br /><br />Initially, you may be tempted to group the movie: The Road with this movie. In the Road, they are heading south, just to get warm, while in this movie, Eli (Denzil Washington) is heading West, to deliver his book. While both are post-apocalyptic films, The Book of Eli is much more well defined, and the objective is clear and attainable. Also, the feeling of despair is not heavily relied upon in the Book of Eli.<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />30 years ago, just after the last big war, Eli commenced his journey west to safely deliver his book. He survives by killing small animals and bartering things that he salvages. Eli has a very calm, unassuming disposition, but is extremely capable when it comes to defending himself. Every night, he quietly reads his book and prays.<br /><br />Cinematics:<br /><br />This film captures quite well the vastness and the emptiness of the land. You get the feeling that the land is now mainly desolate, apart from a few pockets where the survivors now inhabit.<br /><br />The tempo in this film changes rapidly, one moment there is calm and the next its calamity. The fight sequences are as pretty fast. Eli delivers strong measured responses depending upon the threat. The presentation is seamless and it is a very enjoyable action film.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable action film. While, Eli is a very good fighter, he is still only one man, and not invincible. This aspect is also well captured. Thanks to Solara (Mila Kunis) he is able to continue his journey. Watching this show is quite fulfilling, there are some very nice surprises at the end!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I was expecting nothing more than a typical action flick set after a nuclear war when I sat down to watch The Book of Eli today. I had just found out a few days prior that the book he is carrying is suppose to be the last Bible on the Earth, so I kind of had an idea where this movie might be going, but it delved even deeper into the religious aspects than I had expected. There are a few well shot and brutal action scenes (I loved that silhouetted fight that didn't have one editing cut) and the cast is pretty solid. Denzel Washington doesn't say much and lets his machete do most of the talking, but his performance was good enough to make me care for Eli as a character. Gary Oldman is always a treat to watch in any role and he plays a a creepy, confident and compelling bad guy here, without going too over-the-top. Mila Kunis is fine as well (enough to forgive her for Max Payne), which really surprised me. While her looks alone seem to get her movie roles, at least her acting here is almost on par.<br /><br />As you can see from the trailers, the whole movie has a sepia color tone, though it isn't as distracting as I had assumed it would be. There are some very nice visual shots from the Hughes Brothers and the set design, along with some of the locations are top of the line. Some might find parts of the film slow moving, but I liked the comfortable way it flowed. The twist at the end has been cut down by a number of critics, but it really caught me by surprise and I thought it worked in the sense that Eli always seemed to be more than normal man to begin with.<br /><br />The Book of Eli isn't great entertainment from start to finish, but it gives you a little to think about in between the limbs being hacked off. Works for me.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>A man walks through desolate wilderness of a broken world. He suffers from thirst and hunger, wears rags and sleeps in ruins and other fortune hideouts. He must protect himself from the deadly blazing sun during the day and a not less deadly cold at night. He is lonely, as he crosses few people on the road - and amongst those he meets, most are thieves, bandits, madmen and cannibals. Although not yet old, he is not a young man anymore and his strength slowly abandons him. Scars and burns cover his skin, the stigmata of his personal Via Dolorosa. And he can not stop as he carries a heavy burden, and he would rather die than abandon it, as he must bring it to a safe place - which he didn't find yet. His name is Eli (Denzel Washington) and he has been walking like that for the last thirty years...<br /><br />"The book of Eli", as one of the previous reviewers mentioned, is basically a mixture of "Mad Max 2" and "The Road", but with one very special element which distinguishes it from all other post-apocalyptic movies I saw - a very powerful Christian message. Because the burden Eli carries is the last Bible that exists in this devastated world. And two perils threaten this treasure - that it is destroyed, or even worse, that it fells into wrong hands...<br /><br />The wrong hands in this story belong to a certain Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a ruthless, cruel, but cunning and ambitious man, who rules tyrannically over the only "town" lost in the middle of desolation. His power is based mainly on the control of the only source of clean water in his vast domain. He used his power to gather a community in which people are protected from thirst, hunger and roaming cannibals - but where there is little freedom and where brutish thugs serving Carnegie are aristocracy, bulling the powerless plebeians. Carnegie wants to expand his domain and rise from a local boss to a king, but he is not certain if his little army can achieve that. He believes however, that if he owned a Bible and could preach its message to scattered remnants of humanity, he could become quite easily the supreme religious, political and military leader of a kingdom.<br /><br />The unavoidable confrontation between Eli and Carnegie includes some action scenes, but it is essentially spiritual and contains some very simple but powerful lessons. At one moment Eli recites the famous psalm 23: " The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death; I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever." And the whole movie is actually mostly an illustration of this prayer - a message of encouragement to the righteous.<br /><br />But there is also a warning for the wicked - even if you lay your hands on the greatest treasures of the Earth, soon they will turn to dust which will slip between your fingers... And the thing that I liked particularly in this movie, is that director and scenario writer decided, that the Almighty sometimes simply can not resist to play a particularly naughty, even vicious joke at the expense of the villains...)))<br /><br />Another great treasure of this movie is THE twist before the end, which changes completely the way we perceived EVERYTHING that happened before, a little like the revelation in the "Sixth sense" (but just to be precise, NO, it is not the same revelation!). This twist has its importance. I must humbly admit that in the beginning I was not thrilled by this film and I almost stopped watching it after 10 minutes - but I forced myself to continue and I was ultimately greatly rewarded. When the film was finished, I immediately rewatched it a second time, because once you know THE twist, the whole film is changed and it is really worthy to be seen again.<br /><br />Although this is mostly a Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman show, I also liked to see Jennifer Beals and Malcolm McDowell in smaller but important supporting roles. On another hand, Mila Kunis, although quite present on the screen, is not allowed to play a lot, as her character is there mainly to give Eli an occasion to speak and let us know a little about him and his story. It is not very fair for her, but she plays this auxilliary role with grace.<br /><br />Finally, I must admit that being a Christian I may not be entirely objective when reviewing this film and OK, maybe I liked it a little bit more than it desserves. But still, it made quite an impression on me and I can not give it anything less than five stars - and the final message of "The book of Eli", which is also the title of this review, taken from the New Testament, is splendid and a very powerful one.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>A post-apocalyptic action film with Denzel Washington as the hero and Gary Oldman as the villain, with Mila Kunis along for the requisite femme fatale role, and Tom Waits thrown in for good measure?  THE BOOK OF ELI had all the requirements to be a first-rate film, a stand-out in the genre.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  True, it has an interesting premise: a man (Eli) is traveling across the country, carrying the last remaining Bible (not really a spoiler; you kind of know it long before it's "revealed").  Simultaneously, an evil man named Carnegie (groan) is devouring all the books he gets, looking for that one...that holy one.  And when he meets Eli, and finds his book, he wants it.  Oh, he wants it.  The only thing he didn't plan on, though, is how much a** Eli can kick.<br /><br />I will give the film this much: it never quite drops the bottom out on you.  And the action is stylized; it's nice to see Denzel kicking butt and taking names.  And Oldman shines in an otherwise cliched role.  Mila Kunis should probably stick to comedy (remember MAX PAYNE?  Me neither), and it's kind of unsettling, having her be the sole attractive woman in the world.  The film has its flaws, far too many of them--most of it hinges on the script, which is just pathetic at times.  The overt Christian overtones are surprisingly pleasing; they help the film stand out, even if you're not into that kind of thing (and I'm not).  Overall, ELI is a film to see if you're a fan of the genre.  If you're not, you probably won't like it.  It's not as good as its cast and premise would have you believe, but at least it's better than a lot of what else gets handed off as action films these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>This wound up being better than expected. The first few trailers and TV spots were interesting as they completely avoided spoilers relating to the film. More recent TV spots, ones that were being shown as recent as yesterday, pretty much spoil what the book actually is. You may have already been able to guess what particular book it is, but seeing everything unfold without any expectations or predictions is the best way to see the film. The Book of Eli seemed to be going in a direction that was predictable at times, but then went down an unexpected detour to end up at a completely separate destination. Without spoiling too much, the events that are revealed in the finale of the film make the entire experience worthwhile. What transpires in the last twenty minutes or so pretty much makes you want to watch the film again and solidifies the Eli character as a vagabond of the most ultimate caliber.<br /><br />Denzel Washington's portrayal of a man who's gotten so caught up in the mission that's been given to him that he's forgotten how it feels to interact with genuine people is nearly flawless. Well, that and the action scenes he's a part of are spectacular and incredibly exciting to watch. The rather underrated Gary Oldman does a fantastic job of making you hate his character, as well. Carnegie is so smarmy and selfish that you nearly jump for joy once the empire he's built begins to crumble. It was surprising, in a good way, to see Malcolm McDowell have a small part in the film. Although his character doesn't have much screen time, he still made a small impact. Tom Waits as the Engineer managed to have a few great scenes with Denzel Washington, as well. Mila Kunis didn't really offer anything new as far as her acting goes, but she fit the Solara role pretty well. Jennifer Beals seemed to be the weak link in the cast though. She has a scene with Gary Oldman where she begins to break down and start crying that just didn't feel up to par with the rest of the cast, but that could be classified as a nitpick.<br /><br />The Book of Eli is a great way to start the new year with a bang as far as moviegoing experiences go. The film's storyline is a bit reminiscent of films like Fahrenheit 451 and Equilibrium since all three films deal with book burning in a not too distant future. There's actually one scene near the end of the film where Eli and Solara are in a boat that brought Children of Men to mind, a trait that is purely meant as a compliment. The Book of Eli delivers a highly entertaining ride from beginning to end composed of strong performances from the cast, an enticing story, and a blindsided ending. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>It was ok for me I love Denzel but this did not wow me I don't want to give anything away because everybody before me gave brief or long description of the movie when I found out out what the book was  I was saying to myself are you serious this is what they were fighting for for power but I guess it would make sense but don't get me wrong it's still watchable but for me personally it was just ok.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>WARNING: Some spoilers ahead<br /><br />I saw The Book Of Eli (2010) in the theater the day after it was released in January.  I liked it very much.  Denzel Washington was on top of his game in this film.  So was Gary Oldman.  This movie also stars Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals.<br /><br />I'll briefly sum up the plot like this:  It is a post-apocalytic world.  Thirty years earlier the apocalytic event took place.  A man named Eli (Denzel Washington) has in his possession the last remaining King James version of the Bible in the world.  Yes, that's right.  He's a wandering nomad who's on a mission to deliver the Bible to a safe haven in the western part of the U.S.  He travels on foot.  It turns out that Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay ends up being the safe haven.  Along the way to San Francisco, Eli encounters a lot of danger from thieves.  He defeats his adversaries quite easily with his great fighting skills.  He also shows great survival skills.  Eli runs into Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a man who is hell bent on obtaining the Bible.  Carnegie's blind concubine named Claudia (Jennifer Beals) gives Eli water and some food.  Carnegie's daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) finds out Eli has some kind of book in his possession, but she doesn't know what the book is.  When Carnegie asks her what kind of book it is, she just indicates that there is a cross symbol on the cover.  Carnegie realizes it's a Bible.  Eli and his company seek a safe haven in a house, where the residents, Martha (Frances de la Tour) and George (Michael Gambon) are armed and ready at all times.  After an ambush of the house, Carnegie gets possession of the Bible by forcing Eli to hand it over.  Eli gets shot at one point, but continues on as if he isn't hurt very much.  To further sum it up, Eli makes it to Alcatraz and recites the entire Bible from memory.  Carnegie has the actual book.  Carnegie opens up the book and discovers it's written in braille because Eli, as it turns out, is blind.  Claudia (who is blind) refuses to read it to him.  After Eli is done reciting the Bible from memory, he expires from his wounds.  Solara walks home instead of living at Alcatraz.<br /><br />Some things in this movie are quite unbelievable, such as how a blind man can fight and kill people, how there's only one Bible left in the world (even though it was stated in the movie that all the Bibles were burned).  You mean there's not a spare copy lying around somewhere on planet Earth?  But.........the whole point of this movie is to show how the power of the Bible and faith can protect a person from danger and empower them (if you believe in it, of course).<br /><br />Overall, it's a good action movie that's quite moving.  I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Some 30 years after some sort of nuclear war, the world resembles a Mad Max type of hell.  People struggle to survive, cannibalism becomes common and there is no longer a United States of America.  In its place, small communities basically go back to being city states, and the roads are full of rogues & thieves.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a self-sufficient man who is able to take care of himself in spite of all the chaos that the world has descended into.  Books have been burned & most of the inhabitants of the planet are illiterate.<br /><br />This is  a well done movie, and you're always going to get top-notch performances from Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and Malcom Macdowell.  There is one problem w/this film, however, and that's the simple fact that it's not a very good movie.  Frankly, I found it to be a yawner.  I kept hoping that the denouement would be profound & make up for everything leading up to it, but it just wasn't to be.  I felt like the ending of the movie was like waiting in line for 3 hours to see Mick Jagger only to be stuck with a Roseanne Barr concert instead.<br /><br />There is one demographic who will likely enjoy this film, and that would be far right-wing religious types.  The religious overtones basically take Old Testament topics & place them into the future.  If you're into that sort of thing, then you might like this film.  If you're a person of no religious persuasion whatsoever (like me!) then you're much more likely to find the whole premise of the storyline to be rather banal.  It's your call.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>In a post-apocalyptic world that movie fans have become accustomed to recently, Denzel Washington is trying to deliver the only known copy of the King James Bible to an unknown destination. Along the way he encounters the ruthless leader of a small town, played by the great Gary Oldman, who believes that if he can get his hands on the book, he will be able to expand his influence and consolidate his power. This was an interesting story, with the mystery of where the book is going and why it is heading there always on the viewer's mind. The questions are answered at the end with a surprising plot twist.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>Denzel kicks butt in this movie!<br />As usual, he's full of values & lessons to be learned.<br /><br />Entertaining & spiritual<br /><br />If you should happen to buy the "rental ready" DVD, that means that the artwork & DVD have permanent rental labels.<br /><br />CYA on the coast ...<br />;)<br /><br />I forgot to add.<br />This movie makes The Road look like a bad joke.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Well, after watching two equally great movies about a post-apocalyptic world one thing is for sure: life on Earth will suck after the apocalypse. Whether we ultimately nuke ourselves to oblivion or some stray asteroid does the job instead, both of the writers for The Book of Eli and The Road see a dystopian world full of cannibals and little hope. I hope that we never truly experience it, but, man, these two movies were cool!<br /><br />Of the two movies I think that I liked Eli a little bit more, which is reflective of my affinity for violent, graphic novel-esque movies. And indeed, The Book of Eli seemed to be exactly that...a graphic novel come to life about a rogue nomad determined to transport a special book west across a bleak and dangerous landscape. But Eli (Denzil Washington) is prepared to make the transfer...well prepared. Yes, there is unrest in the forest and Eli will keep it all equal with hatchet, ax and saw. And are higher forces at work helping to guide Eli along?<br /><br />Then there's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB563E">The Road</a>. This time the traveler is a man (Viggo Mortensen) also heading off in search of a safe haven. This man believes that the safe haven is south, and like Eli, he also has some cargo with him that he intends to protect and deliver safely at all costs...that cargo being his son. The land that Mortensen & son attempt to cross is in the same condition and full of the same dangers that I mentioned that Eli was dealing with. The Road is a lot lighter on the violence than Eli and more about a father trying to lead his son down a path of righteousness, while at the same time maintaining self-preservation as numero uno.<br /><br />I'd almost suggest that the two stories could be tied together and happening simultaneously in a United States devastated by catastrophe. Although, in Eli the apocalypse is explained as the result of nuclear war and bright sunlight burning the planet up due to resulting damage to the ozone layer; and I don't recall an explanation in The Road, but I think that we're supposed to gather that it was from a giant asteroid or something that created a world where a dust cloud permanently obscures the sun. Either way it's a living doomsday.<br /><br />Both movies feature a host of A-list actors, and even the actors that aren't as well known give A-list performances. Action. Thrills. Emotion. Get it all in two parallel worlds where you will kill or be killed for something that today you'd have discarded as trash. The Book of Eli and The Road as a double-feature for your weekend? Dreadfully good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>...but not bad either. Like always, Washington is awesome but the plot leaves more than a little bit to be desired. The underlying idea was kind of cool but the execution is somewhat strained. It's a little slow (especially in the beginning) and has a little bit of a "Mad Max" feel to it. Still, it's worth watching.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />As an aside: how the hell do they still have gasoline 30 years after the collapse of civilization? They have no refining capacity (as far as I can tell) and, if I'm not mistaken (I'm not a chemist), gasoline degrades after a year or two and becomes unusable...<br /><br />Not important to the story but, still, that just bothered me...</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I just saw this one in the theater.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I wasn't overly impressed.  Denzel Washington was great, as always, and so was Gary Olman, but the story line was a wee bit slow at times and kind of lacking a punch.  It was a little gory, too (at least for me, anyway--not really my kind of movie).<br /><br />The story begins with fallen ash and dead bodies everywhere.  There has been a massive war that has left many dead and the land stripped.  It has become survival of the fittest for the most part.  Gangs are worse than wild animals and often ambush folks and take whatever they can to survive. Water and food are hard to find.  Some people even resort to eating human meat, and they are the ones with shaky hands.  The basic scene is very similar to Mel Gibson's "Mad Max" movie from the 1970s (?).<br /><br />Denzel (Eli) is our hero.  He walks the land in peace, trying to survive, but he can also defend himself when others try to mess with him.  He is unbelievably quick with a knife, gun, or arrow and when he must kill, he prays over the bodies.  He carries a book with him and is on a mission from God to take the book to the West Coast.  The book is the King James Bible.  After the war, all other remaining copies of the book were destroyed.<br /><br />Gary Olman is a power hungry bad guy who is searching for the same book, because it is said to give power to its owner and he wants to create a kingdom for himself out of what's left.  Gary gets a bit overly enthusiastic when he finds out that Eli has that book and the struggle begins.<br /><br />As I said, it's good but not great, although both actors do an excellent job in their roles.  Would I watch it again?  No!</p></br></body></html>

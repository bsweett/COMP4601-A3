In a prologue set in World War II, the U.S. Army foils a Nazi plot to open an other dimensional portal and unleash monster fiends upon the world.  However, an infant demon slips through into our world.  Taking pity on him, government scientist Professor Broom raises the tyke as his own.  60 years later, we find the demon all grown-up and fighting paranormal menaces for a secret U.S. government agency.  However, Hellboy finds himself batting not only the evils of his past, but his own feelings for Liz, a fellow freak with pyrotechnic powers.  <p> Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as the demon with a blue-collar attitude towards his job.  In many ways, he comes across as your local garbage man or plumber with his world-weary view towards the many monsters he faces. His snappy comebacks are especially amusing.  Perlman?s costume and make-up also reinforce the image with his floppy raincoat and filed-down horns, which resemble goggles more than anything.  Selma Blair is touching as the somewhat sullen object of Hellboy?s affections, while  John Hurt brings an added amount of warmth as the elder Professor Broom.  Rupert Evans is solid as the young FBI agent introduced to this unusual situation.  As the evil Rasputin, Karel Rodin somewhat underplays the part, making him a rather bland bad guy.  Doug Jones, with the voice of David Hyde Pierce, are delightful as fish-man Abe Sapien.  Lending solid support is Jeffrey Tambor as Hellboy?s antagonistic boss. <p>Despite having a lower budget than most films of its type, the special effects are definitely better than average with snaky haired monsters providing menace and a complaining zombie half-corpse providing laughs. HELLBOY is a fast-paced, fun film that definitely will draw in fans of the cult comic, while the irreverent attitude will appeal to action fans in general.  It doesn?t matter if you?re familiar to the comic or not, this film is definitely a fun time, and as such, is one that I definitely recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>I've never been a fan of the Hellboy comics, but I did enjoy this movie for the most part.

Big-hearted but derivative supernatural adventure.

Pretty good, I don't follow this character much so I am not a huge fan, but I like the movie. and I never heard of him til' now, Of course I wish hollywood wouldn't ruin comic books by making a movie out of every one of them! Good movie, good special effects and action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Working with a near perfect balance of action, humor and charm, the first of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F7MSFW">Hellboy</a> series to reach the big screen is a highly entertaining flick. While Ron Perlamn's effective performance as the gruff but warm hearted red monster centers the film, he is surrounded by a phalanx of supporting actors that give "Hellboy" its broadened success.<br /><br />In particular, John Hurt as Hellboy's father figure caretaker, Dr Bloom, exudes a strong intelligence and sense of purpose to avoid his character being a scientist cardboard cutout. Rupert Evans plays a befuddles new handler, newly exposed to the top-secret paranormal agency that Hellboy dwells in. Add some angry Nazis and one p-o'd rasputin who want to destroy the world, and you have a firecracker of a fun film.<br /><br />Written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, the script pops at all the right moments all while adding character touches. The action sequences are a rollercoaster of thrill and scare (and the box of kittens is a hoot), along with a terrific visual sense. Even Jeffrey Tambor's sourpuss gets a good lesson in accepting the unusual before the film ends. For fans of the resurgent comic book movie genre, "Hellboy" hits all the right notes.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>The Director's Cut of Hellboy is now available on the superior Blu-Ray Disc format!!! The picture and sound quality are superb!!! This great disc also has some nice extras as well!!! Recommended!!! A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy implements countless impressive ideas, including seamless computer graphics fused with animatronics and puppeteers, ingenious character designs and fascinating monstrosities. But for all of its undeniable visual flair, the film weakens due to sore-thumb dialogue and a regimen of predictable plot devices; as well as too many unlikely conveniences and the ever-popular need for heroes and villains to strike a lengthy poster-perfect pose before and after every action sequence.<br /><br />During World War II, Rasputin (Karl Roden) aids the Nazis in opening up a portal to another world, which is abruptly shut when U.S. forces grenade the operation. Although Rasputin is destroyed, a tiny red creature is left behind on Earth to be raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt). Dubbed Hellboy, the demon soon grows into a powerful crime-fighter intent on keeping extra terrestrial baddies at bay.<br /><br />Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is not alone, and is joined by Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), an amphibious creature that possesses incredible knowledge. Elizabeth Sherman (Selma Blair) also has super powers, although her pyrokinetic firestarter abilities are much harder to control. Together the group works for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), constantly and covertly cleaning up the messes left by alien life forms and resurrected enemies from the past.<br /><br />The action sequences are all fast-paced, expertly choreographed, and arrive just in time to speed up the story when things get too convoluted or unexplainable. Seamlessly blending computer animated models of Hellboy, Sammael, Abe Sapien and many others with practical effects, the film achieves a startlingly realistic look. Like James Cameron's Aliens, the various monsters have a rubbery, tangible appearance, slaver real slime and appear to be actors in costumes more often than not. And this is a good thing, because it peerlessly prevents visual annoyances like those found in most major fantasy films in which Spider-men effortlessly swing from concrete jungle rooftops and hulking green men float through vast canyons.<br /><br />A stepping stone to del Toro's next visual masterpiece (Pan's Labyrinth), Hellboy utilizes many unquestionably unique character designs and concepts. From Kroenen's hideously scarred visage (and his skill with bladed weapons, though not as cool as V from V For Vendetta), to Sammael's lumbering cartilaginous figure, to Abe Sapien's twitching webbed hands, the oddities speak wonders for both the makeup crew and original comic book creator Mike Mignola. Along with these bizarre concepts are idiosyncrasies and affecting personalities bestowed on every human and monster, which allows for more personable and relatable qualities from such inhuman concoctions as a giant crimson-skinned demon. The charisma of Hellboy (ample amounts of credit goes to Ron Perlman) and his wide array of emotions make the human liaison to the audience John Meyers (Rupert Evans) nearly obsolete. The set designs are also fascinating and numerous, from snowy graveyards to steaming sewers to a booby-trapped underground labyrinth.<br /><br />Hellboy deserves credit for its innovative approach to visuals in a comic book adaptation, but loses points for noticeably trite dialogue from many of the supporting characters. The plot is also disappointing with its convoluted legend and prophecy jargon and otherworldly nonsense which simply doesn't do justice to the awesome characters battling across the screen. The fun somehow eludes the ruddy Hellboy, despite all of the action, comedy, violence, destruction, mayhem, romance and special effects.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>While some good directors never quite "get it," it took Guillermo Del Toro only one misfire -- the icky, slow-paced "Blade 2" -- to get the whole comic-book adaptation thing right.<br /><br />In fact, just about everything is right with "Hellboy" -- Del Toro crafted an action blockbuster with a grimy, slimy cult-movie feel and a quirky sense of humor. It's graced with excellent acting, spectacular action scenes, and the trappings of clockpunk and Lovecraftian horror -- not to mention that it stars a six-foot-tall scarlet demon with a soft spot for kittens.<br /><br />In 1944, young Professor Broom accompanied an army regiment to a remote Scottish island, where the Nazis -- led by Rasputin -- were about to open a portal to another world, and allow the vast tentacled Ogru Jahad (Seven Gods of Chaos) to enter our world. Rasputin and the Nazis were destroyed, but something came through the portal -- a baby demon, whom Broom names Hellboy.<br /><br />Fast-forward sixty years -- a grown Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his fishy friend Abe (Doug Jones) are working at a paranormal government agency that specializes in policing the supernatural, with the weirded-out Agent Myers (Rupert Evans) just joining the team. Soon afterwards, Hellboy is called on to kill Sammael the Hellhound -- but it turns out that Sammael can replicate himself indefinitely.<br /><br />As Hellboy and his team try to hunt down the remaining Sammaels, the dying Professor Broom (John Hurt) finds that a revived Rasputin and his immortal Nazi followers have orchestrated all this. And Rasputin is continuing to pull the strings behind the scenes -- including using Hellboy's love Liz (Selma Blair), a depressed pyrokinetic. And when Hellboy suffers a devastating loss, his journey will take him right back to his roots -- and the potential destruction of the world.<br /><br />Watching "Hellboy," it's easy to see how Guillermo Del Toro because world-famous for the exquisitely dark "Pan's Labyrinth," and why he's been chosen to direct the forthcoming "Hobbit" movies. This adaptation could have just been another paint-by-numbers comic-book story, but Del Toro gives it the kind of grime, quirk, brains and heart that a lasting cult movie should have.<br /><br />Part of that cult appeal is "Hellboy's" distinctive look, with Lovecraftian tentacle-gods and some steampunky details. And the action scenes are pretty spectacular -- trains, slimy hellhounds, sword-swinging Nazis with chopped-up faces, giant clock cogs, and a fiery explosion in a mental asylum. And there are some truly spectacular action scenes in a vast underground labyrinth, full of ancient hammers and collapsing bridges. There's just enough action and grossness, without going overboard.<br /><br />But Del Toro is able to balance out the action with some truly touching moments, such as the aged Broom's final scenes in his firelit study. And there's a lot of dark humor here as well -- and not all of it is Hellboy's dry one-liners. The movie is liberally peppered with dark humor moments ("1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45." "DID he now?"), including some hilariously macabre scenes involving a bad-tempered Russian zombie ("This is Ivan Klimatovich. Say hi, Ivan." "Go that way, Red Monkey!").<br /><br />Most importantly, Del Toro is able to give his characters little human quirks -- hair plugs, love of cats, and Hellboy sanding down his horns in the morning. Perlman is simply amazing as "Red," whose gruff scarlet exterior hides a kindly, affectionate heart. Not many actors could emote through that many prosthetics (including a very lifelike tail), but Perlman makes it look natural.<br /><br />Though he's playing a ninetyish old professor, Hurt plays his role with a quiet, powerful sense of goodness. Jones and Evans also do excellent jobs, one as an erudite psychic fish-man ("We lead a charmed life," he observes as cockroaches skitter around him) and an earnest young agent. Selma Blair is the one downside -- she sort of mumbles in a monotone most of the time.<br /><br />"Hellboy" is one of the best comic-book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>I had never even heard of Hellboy before the movie arrived, and I instantly wondered just what type of harbinger of doom and destruction could anyone be with the word "boy" in their name. Even the paltry Babel Fish of Hitchhikers fame would merely die choking on its own laughter.....or so I thought. I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie "Hellboy" and the overall story that it followed.<br /><br />The main character is a demon, called "Hellboy" (Ron Perlman) funnily enough, who comes through a portal opened by Rasputin, (Karl Roden), at the behest of the desperate Nazis in 1944. After the portal is closed with the help of Professor Broom, (later played by John Hurt), Hellboy is found and becomes the FBI's latest weapon against the "things that go bump in the night". The bad guys come back in the present day to end the world, and they are Rasputin, his girlfriend Ilsa, (Bridget Hodson) and Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, (Ladislav Beran). To add to the mix, Hellboy has a new "babysitter" in Agent John Myers, (Rupert Evans) and a love interest in Liz Sherman, (Selma Blair).<br /><br />Ron Perlman was basically born to play the role of Hellboy, from the basic structure of his face to the very mannerisms and attitudes that Hellboy exudes. Perlman was absolutely stunning in this role, and had the right, sardonic wit to pull it off with class and panache. Even with a huge amount of prosthetic make-up, Perlman was not limited in his expressiveness during the movie. The action scenes were also excellent, and the make-up did not seem to inhibit Perlman's movements at all.<br /><br />Karl Roden brings an intense and deeply emotional Rasputin to the movie, and particularly in the last scenes brings through an intense amount of feeling. However, I would not say that the eerie sense of evilness really came from him. That was really provided by the near-silent Karl Ruprecht Kroenen and his deadly blades. Kroenen is very much the silent type, and mostly communicates through gestures, if at all. The masks that he wears through the movie also add to the inhuman quality of the character, as well as a very quiet, but noticable hissing as he breathes.<br /><br />For the special effects and the set designs, I can only add to the positive comments for this movie. The dark feel of the movie was excellent and added to the sense of forboding that was brought by some characters. Also, the achievements of the effects team were really stunning, and what they managed to do with various everyday items has been great. Also, the robotics and so on have been excellently executed and have only added to the movie's overall feel and atmosphere.<br /><br />The 2-disc set provides some interesting information on both the making of the film and various characters as well. I found them to be very informative and well set out. If you do not want to wade through stuff that is not interesting to you, you can go straight to that section, rather than watch the entire "Making Off..." thing.<br /><br />For action and a good story that combines history, fantasy, Hell, magic, and some very interesting characters, "Hellboy" is pretty hard to pass up. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it, including the Samaritan, which "uses really big bullets."</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Just proves you can overcome your birth.  Hellboy was born out of a hole in a transcendental portal that was a joint project of Rasputin and the Nazis in a last-ditch attempt to create the New World Order.<br /><br />He was raised by Prof. Bloom and works for the Bureau of Psychic Phenomenon, a group set together to battle evil.  He's red as an apple,  smokes stogies, files his horns to fit in, and likes cats.<br /><br />The graphics, the concept is faithful to the comics.  I think the action could have been upped a bit.  There are quite a few slower portions in the films unlike Xmen, or Blade, for example.<br /><br />Overall, a good and interesting film and an essential for Hellboy comic fans who want a 'complete set.'</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>The 2004 comic book-inspired film "Hellboy" was quite entertaining.  Created by Mike Mignola and first published in 1994 by Dark Horse Comics (which was founded in 1986 by Mike Richardson in Oregon), Hellboy is a red demon that works as a paranormal investigator and fights occult threats for the fictional U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.  As depicted in the 2004 film, Hellboy arrives on Earth under rather unusual circumstances.  A fictionalized version of Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (Karel Roden) did not die during the Russian Revolution.  Instead, he works for the Nazis in the 1940's with the promise of giving them a powerful supernatural means of defeating the Allies.  (The real Rasputin, 1869?-1916, was a Russian mystic and famed occultist for Tsar Nicholas II.) Using strange & sophisticated equipment with the aid of Nazi scientists, Rasputin constructs a machine that can open a doorway into another realm inhabited by long-ago banished beings.  Rasputin succeeds in the opening the doorway just as U.S. troops attack their site.  Rasputin is seemingly killed, but something did come through the mystical doorway: a young, red demon.  Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt), who had traveled with the U.S. troops, finds the young demon and raises it as his own child.  Naming the demon Hellboy, it grows into a large and powerful being (played by Ron Perlman); but instead of becoming an instrument of destruction as envisioned by Rasputin, Hellboy becomes a powerful force for good.  However, not everyone who assisted Rasputin the night that he opened the doorway was killed or captured, including Rasputin's lover Ilsa (Biddy Hodson) and the very dark and bizarre man Karl Ruprect Kroenen (Ladislav Beran).  In present day along with Hellboy at the super-secret Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is the amphibian humanoid ("icthyo sapien") known as Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), but one of the paranormal agents has recently opted to stay in a mental hospital, the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  Professor Bruttenholm selects newbie agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) to become Hellboy's new partner, who takes an interest in getting Liz back to the bureau; which is a good thing since Ilsa and Karl intend to resurrect Rasputin to carry out his evil plans.<br /><br />With a fair bit of acting, a touch of humor, good special effects and an interesting story, "Hellboy" is an entertaining and engaging film. Other memorable characters include Agent Clay (Corey Johnson), the kid on the rooftop (Rory Copus) and the deceased Ivan Klimatovich.  My least favorite character is the head of the bureau, Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor).  Mike Mignola, who was also one of the film's associate producers, played a brief (and uncredited) moment in the film as knight.  The film's director (and co-writer), Guillermo del Toro, also had a brief, uncredited role in the film as a dragon.  Memorable scenes include the Nazis, Myers' arrival, Hellboy's fights, Liz's fire-starting abilities and the closing scenes.  Overall, I rate the 2004 "Hellboy" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>The movie is based off the comic hellboy, though I have not read hellboy it has been said to be loyal to the original material.  The movie starts in the latter period of World War 2.  The Nazi's feel that they are going to los the war, and are desperately looking for an edge or a weapon to turn the tides.  So an enigmatic figure creates a gate to the resting place of a very HP Lovecraft inspired creature, alien, powerful, and destrucive.  But a Professor Bloom and a a group of American soldiers were there as part of a new paranormal government agency.  They manage to stop this but find a humanoid creature with devil like features, but a complete child.  The professor takes him in and nurtures him to become a hero and an member of his agency.<br /><br />The movie skips forward to modern day times.  Hellboy is an adolescent, but bigger than the average body builder.  He eats insane quantities of food and has a strange affinity for cats, and they cover his room.  Rumors of hellboys existence are all over the papers, but regarded as rumor and local legend by many.  Along with an aquatic pyschic, a woman who can start flames, and more mundane government agents(men in black).<br /><br />The plot is based off the ressurection of the one that opened the portal he came through.  He is paired with the woman he peformed the ritual with, and a strange man who is mostly artificial, a lot of his body parts and movements are a complex set of gears, like a clock.<br /><br />This movie was very well made.  I have to agree with a lot of its critics, the character development was a bit slow, but it was worth the wait.  The acting was top notch, the villians menacing and mysterious, well cast, the good guys quirky and 3 dimensional, and Ron Pearlman shines as Hellboy, a creature trying to pass for human.<br /><br />Hellboy himself is an intersting character.  He goes to the length of filing his horns down to look more human, there is a funny scene of him working on them with a sander, and he doesn't like them looked at.  He has a strange sense of humor from being locked up and having to be kept a secret.  Though he is huge, he is still mentally and emotionally an adolescent, often breaking out of the confines to see his crush.  He likes cats so much that he defends a basket of kittens while fighting an evil monster.  Ron Pearlman doesn't play Hellboy, he is hellboy.<br /><br />The plot is interesting and well paced.  The action sequences were fun and kept things interesting.  The plot exposition is informative without being too wordy.<br /><br />Despite its flaws this is a very enjoyable film.  Appealing to those interested in HP Lovecraft like horror, comic books, science fiction, the occult, and action movies.  I look forward to the sequel, and the cast of strange villians and heroes they will introduce.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>Pros:<br /><br />The Cast<br /><br />The Acting<br /><br />Humor<br /><br />Effects<br /><br />Directing<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Parts of the script<br /><br />Drags at a few scenes<br /><br />Plot is week<br /><br />In the end this is a solid film that is alot of fun.

I never read the graphic novels or anything so I didn't know the story but when I first saw the trailer I thought... this looks cool. I wasn't wrong. I thought Ron Pearlman was perfect as Big Red and the cast was really good. Even Selma Blair who I think is a weak actress was good. John Hurt was excellent as usual.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes it was a bit weak in some spots but it was fun. I liked the whole premise of Hellboy. The Rasputin stuff was good and the villians were excellent. I just wish they would have concentrated more on the Nazi villians (Rasputin, his female stooge and the Nazi guy with the blades... he was cool). They kind of had too much of Hellboy battling the 'hounds of hell' thing too much. But it was still entertaining and fun and had a lot of good puns and humor. I liked the triangle between Hellboy, Liz and the young FBI guy.<br /><br />Fun flick and worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>When I first saw the trailer to this film, i admit i turned my nose up at it.

However, the Nazi's failed to get their hands on Hellboy as the Allies brought him to the United States to fight paranormal crimes.  Sixty years later Hellboy has to face prejudice because of his demonic looks in world that is not ready to accept characters such as Hellboy and his companion Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), an aquatic being.  Thus, Hellboy and Abe Sapien have joined forces with the FBI as they help protect a world unaware of their existence.<br /><br />Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) discovered and nurtured Hellboy as his own son, which has brought out the sensitive side of Hellboy.  However, when Hellboy is not in contact with his sensitive side he is as cool and reckless as a small God should be as he goes about smacking down monsters and other demonic creatures in order to protect mankind.  Broom also has a terminal disease that prevents him from continuing to manage the organization in which Hellboy and Abe Sapien work.  This has led Broom to acquire a young FBI agent, John Myers (Rupert Evans), to be his successor as he believes he has the tools to keep Hellboy in balance with himself.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro creates an in-your-face cinematic experience with Hellboy, which is based on the comic book, Hellboy.  It is inspiring that Hellboy has been filmed in the true sense of a comic book as it is lightheartedly switching between action, comedy, and a melodramatic love triangle.  This does not hurt the cinematic experience, but instead elevates it to a pleasant cinematic event where good fights evil.  At the end, Hellboy is a must see for comic book readers, superhero fans, but also anyone else who enjoys a warm action packed journey.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>Hellboy is the perfect anti-hero. Born in a moment when the gates between this world and a dimension of evil stood open, his intended purpose was evil. But one of those strange chances from which action films are made catapults the newborn demon into the arms of Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). A candy bar later, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a convert to the side of good.<br /><br />Too grotesque to fit into society, massively strong and completely impulsive, Hellboy becomes a demon hunter. But he continually skirts the edge of exposure, and his brash and extreme attitude are a trial to his foster father and the agents who fund and support the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.<br /><br />When Grigori Rasputin (Karl Roden) returns to the living with the single purpose of once more forcing open the gates to evil, Hellboy joins fish man Abe Sapiens in an effort to track the evil down to its source, and, with a massive display of special effects, turn back the dark.<br /><br />The love interest (there has to be one) is Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). Like Hellboy and Abe, Liz is special. If she loses control of herself explosive fires happen - buildings burn down. Hellboy loves her, but is acutely aware of his limitations. Liz, is afraid of the power of love, fearful of what she might do in a moment of passion. Hellboy (who is inflammable) would seem to be a perfect fit, but there is a tender dysfunctionality to their relationship.<br /><br />The effects are spectacular with wild creature chases, subway chases, mortuary chases, transformations and an entire collection of onderful sets. But the film really has much more to offer than its eye-candy. The script, which could easily have become a string of banalities, has real meat to it, and the central characters may be impossible, but they are entirely believable. Director Guillermo del Toro has found the heart of an action film and created an inadvertant classic.<br /><br />Make a point of seeing this. You will find countless goodies on the side, including extended commentaries.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>Except for spiderman 2 this is the best super hero movie ever, but it still could use a little work and thats why i'm waiting for the extended 3 disc DVD.  I rented the movie today, and its definetly worth buying, but the movie could be a little longer, and use some more action and more info on the story and characters.  The action is is good but of course it doesnt compare to the matrix, the fights are slow at times but still well done, but there is more then action to keep you interested.  Ron Perlman is very funny and as a kind of little kid sense to him, but he also is believable when he is serious too, which isnt that much.  The movie is funny, intelligent and complicated, suspensful, and action packed.  As far as the DVD goes is the pictures good the sounds blah blah blah, the extras are very good, but i would wait for the extended DVD in October and i am.  8 out of a 10, buy Van Helsing when your at it its better, comes out on the same day, has lots more action, and Kate Beckinsale.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Overlong (this refers to the Director's Cut) and poorly-structured, Hellboy coasts for a while on the considerable charm of Ron Perlman but ultimately collapses upon itself; I love Del Toro, but found Hellboy to be a movie long on imagination and short on storytelling technique.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Oh No! Those evil nazis are back, attempting to gate in another slimy entity from the great beyond! It's up to HELLBOY (Ron Perlman) and his band of misfits (including Abe Sapien the fishman) to stop them. HELLBOY is a good solid wiz-bang of a movie! Lots of excitement, gunfire, explosions, and a fairly decent plot. There's even a love interest that actually works without making us wanna barf! I loved the Firestarter gal! As for the bad guys, I thought the self-mutilated nazi fella was totally creepy / cool! HELLBOY has potential as a series of movies, IF the stories are good. Perlman is a natural as the demonoid hero! Check it out...</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>I am not a comic book kind of guy and typically do not get into films of this genre, however Hellboy was quite a surpise.  Perlman is excellent in the titular role and the suppoting cast is strong throughout.  What really won me over though was the non-stop action and amazing FX.  They were some of the "cleanest" looking FX I have seen in quite some time (one major fight scene excluded).  ALso it is beautifully filmed - you could tell the director really took care with this project.  Highly entertaining and never dull - a great escapist movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>this is one great super hero movie.  i really like Hellboys stone arm.  come with 2 disks and a lot of features.  a great movie 2 have.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>HELLBOY begins in 1944 Scotland. Hitler has been organizing a paranormal team for sometime, led by the infamous Russian Zarist advisor, Rasputin. President Roosevelt has dispatched a team to stop the evil scum before they release dark powers from another realm. The Americans succeed in thwarting the Nazis' plan and Rasputin is sucked into the nether regions. However, before the victory, something from the great beyond comes through the portal. That something turns out to be a little red demon with a huge stone fist. The Americans are entranced by the creature and name him Hellboy. Hellboy is adopted and raised by Professor Trevor Bloom (John Hurt) and the two become prominent, but hidden members of the secret paranormal branch of the FBI. Years later Rasputin is resurrected and it's up to Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Professor Bloom, Agent John Myers, and their staff to rid the world of the Rasputin menance.<br /><br />Ron Perlman portrays Hellboy and he embodies the character just as good, if not better than Tobey Maguire did as Spider-man or Christopher Reeves did as Superman. I don't think there is any other actor alive who could have captured the nuances of Hellboy so well. Heck, I'll go so far as to say that if Hollywood ever really seriously considered acting nominations for action/sci-fi pictures (they should consider all films, but they don't), Perlman would have one in the bag. The other supporting actors do a good job, too. Personally, I especially enjoyed the performance of John Hurt: he's one of the most underrated character actors of our time.<br /><br />The action in HELLBOY is typical of a comic book flick and some might hold that against the movie. Still, it is a comic book flick and for that, it's pretty good stuff. There is some fairly witty and original dialogue in the script and the direction of Guillermo del Toro holds everything in place. There are a few words of foul language here and there, but nothing that is out of place.<br /><br />My only complaint about the film is that the villains are completely underdeveloped. Most of the good guys have some sort of character development during the screen time (though Abe Sapien doesn't get a whole lot). However, the bad guys; and especially Rasputin, don't get any development at all. This is a little disappointing because Rasputin is such an interesting character and the film could have been even better with a little more Rasputin character development. Other than that, HELLBOY is one rip-roaring good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7NFDO3I1TA.html">A4X7NFDO3I1TA</a><br/><p>I Love this movie. I would recommend this to everyone. It has some amazing features and it a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Hellboy is at it again, saving humankind from supernatural threats that only a handful have even heard of. This time, it starts with an ancient truce between the mundane and magical worlds. We mortals seem to have memories as short as our lives, and have violated the truce. The rulers of the faerie see honor in holding up their end of the pact, no matter what. Others in that land want back what was once theirs ...<br /><br />The effect-meisters have risen to a very high level in this one, populating the world next to ours with a spectacular assortment of beings and a rats' nest of medieval alleyways for them to live in. A few things lack explanation - do most marketplaces have a working ore-crusher conveniently installed in the wall? No matter, it looks good, and comic books (even on the big screen) are at least as much about looks as story and characters.<br /><br />Which is good. Some of the dialog remains a bit comic-booky, rattled bureaucratic functionaries lack depth, and the love interest[s] suit the fanboy generation better than more grownup tastes. The humorous moments save these flaws from becoming ponderous, though. BTW, Liz (hot babe that she is) springs some great sequel-bait on us at the end. So, on the whole, HB2 comes across as what it is: a comic book movie, not the finest of its genre, but a well-done piece of summer entertainment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>While some good directors never quite "get it," it took Guillermo Del Toro only one misfire -- the icky, slow-paced "Blade 2" -- to get the whole comic-book adaptation thing right.<br /><br />In fact, just about everything is right with "Hellboy" -- Del Toro crafted an action blockbuster with a grimy, slimy cult-movie feel and a quirky sense of humor. It's graced with excellent acting, spectacular action scenes, and the trappings of clockpunk and Lovecraftian horror -- not to mention that it stars a six-foot-tall scarlet demon with a soft spot for kittens.<br /><br />In 1944, young Professor Broom accompanied an army regiment to a remote Scottish island, where the Nazis -- led by Rasputin -- were about to open a portal to another world, and allow the vast tentacled Ogru Jahad (Seven Gods of Chaos) to enter our world. Rasputin and the Nazis were destroyed, but something came through the portal -- a baby demon, whom Broom names Hellboy.<br /><br />Fast-forward sixty years -- a grown Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his fishy friend Abe (Doug Jones) are working at a paranormal government agency that specializes in policing the supernatural, with the weirded-out Agent Myers (Rupert Evans) just joining the team. Soon afterwards, Hellboy is called on to kill Sammael the Hellhound -- but it turns out that Sammael can replicate himself indefinitely.<br /><br />As Hellboy and his team try to hunt down the remaining Sammaels, the dying Professor Broom (John Hurt) finds that a revived Rasputin and his immortal Nazi followers have orchestrated all this. And Rasputin is continuing to pull the strings behind the scenes -- including using Hellboy's love Liz (Selma Blair), a depressed pyrokinetic. And when Hellboy suffers a devastating loss, his journey will take him right back to his roots -- and the potential destruction of the world.<br /><br />Watching "Hellboy," it's easy to see how Guillermo Del Toro because world-famous for the exquisitely dark "Pan's Labyrinth," and why he's been chosen to direct the forthcoming "Hobbit" movies. This adaptation could have just been another paint-by-numbers comic-book story, but Del Toro gives it the kind of grime, quirk, brains and heart that a lasting cult movie should have.<br /><br />Part of that cult appeal is "Hellboy's" distinctive look, with Lovecraftian tentacle-gods and some steampunky details. And the action scenes are pretty spectacular -- trains, slimy hellhounds, sword-swinging Nazis with chopped-up faces, giant clock cogs, and a fiery explosion in a mental asylum. And there are some truly spectacular action scenes in a vast underground labyrinth, full of ancient hammers and collapsing bridges. There's just enough action and grossness, without going overboard.<br /><br />But Del Toro is able to balance out the action with some truly touching moments, such as the aged Broom's final scenes in his firelit study. And there's a lot of dark humor here as well -- and not all of it is Hellboy's dry one-liners. The movie is liberally peppered with dark humor moments ("1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45." "DID he now?"), including some hilariously macabre scenes involving a bad-tempered Russian zombie ("This is Ivan Klimatovich. Say hi, Ivan." "Go that way, Red Monkey!").<br /><br />Most importantly, Del Toro is able to give his characters little human quirks -- hair plugs, love of cats, and Hellboy sanding down his horns in the morning. Perlman is simply amazing as "Red," whose gruff scarlet exterior hides a kindly, affectionate heart. Not many actors could emote through that many prosthetics (including a very lifelike tail), but Perlman makes it look natural.<br /><br />Though he's playing a ninetyish old professor, Hurt plays his role with a quiet, powerful sense of goodness. Jones and Evans also do excellent jobs, one as an erudite psychic fish-man ("We lead a charmed life," he observes as cockroaches skitter around him) and an earnest young agent. Selma Blair is the one downside -- she sort of mumbles in a monotone most of the time.<br /><br />"Hellboy" is one of the best comic-book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>This movie has many subtle points that might evade the viewer.  For example Jeffrey Tabor's boss man, like Ron Perlman's Hellboy, is always smoking a cigar.  It is not until close to the end of the movie that the two develop some regard for the other, after having to work closely together in dangerous circumstances.  It is the short exchange between the two on the subject of cigars that indicates that they have finally come to understand one another somewhat.  Tabor's character shows Hellboy that he should light his cigar with a wooden match "to preserve the flavor".  In reply Hellboy actually says "thanks"!</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>I'll be discussing both the two disc and three disc edition of "Hellboy" here. Unfortunately, the automated systemed won't allow me to post this as a separate review so, just in case the review shows up under both, I'll include both.<br /><br />TWO DISC EDITION:<br />It must be hell to have horns and a stone hand. Rasputin the mad monk who manipulated the Russian royalty prior to the Russian Revolution never died. He not only survived being stabbed, shot, poisoned and drowning but during World War II he worked for the Nazis. Hitler hoped that Rasputin might be able to unleash the 7 Gods of Chaos to help Hitler win the war and dominate the world. The only thing that can stop Hitler and Rasputin's minions which includes a nasty masochistic half mechanical man named Kroenen (Ladislav Beran in some scenes)is Professor Broom (Kevin Trainor as the young Bloom) who has studied the occult. He and a group of American soldiers storm Rasputin's castle stopping the 7 Gods of Chaos from entering our world. In the process Rasputin is sucked into the other strange realm and a tiny red monkey like creature that looks like Satan with a stone hand is released into our world.<br /><br />Sixty years later Rasputin's minions revive him bringing him back from the other side. Meanwhile Professor Broom (Hurt) has established a paranormal division of the F.B.I with Hellboy (Perlman) and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones but voiced by David Hyde Pierce of "Fraiser" fame) a half human/half sea creature and Liz (Blair) a human with the ability to control fire. With the addition of a new assistant John Myers (Evans) recruited from the F.B.I. these five are all that stand between us and chaos. The only problem is that Rasputin has plans for using Hellboy himself to help release the 7 Gods of Chaos himself.<br /><br />"Hellboy" looks surprisingly sharp and vivid capturing all the primary colors that percolated beneath the surface of Mike Mignola's comic book. The film does suffer a little bit due to all the extras included on the first disc and could have benefited from concentrating only on picture and sound quality of the film on the first disc and all the extras on the second.<br /><br />The two disc set clearly went on an eating binge. How else to explain all the wonderful extras packed on this great set. To begin with we have a nice introduction by the director. On the first disc featuring the feature film there are branching behind the scenes sequences you can access while watching the film itself and then return to where you were. It's a fascinating glimpse behind the movie almost giving you the experience as if you were on the set then watching the assembled dailies the next same day.<br /><br />THREE DISC DIRECTOR'S CUT:<br />There are some subtle and not so subtle differences in "Hellboy-The Director's Cut". The big difference involves how Rasputin was changed when he came back from the other side. There's also a number of dramatic moments such as Professor Broom discovery of his cancer as well as some fight sequences that have been extended in minor but subtle ways. That said, it's essentially the same film but richer for the include of the 15 or so minutes of additional footage.<br /><br />The first disc has a brand new commentary by director del Toro and a commentary/isolated score by composer Beltram. The storyboard track now has new images added to it (quite a bit more as a matter of fact).The "branching comics" feature is much more extensive than the previous one but the features on the first disc remain pretty close to the previous edition.<br /><br />The second disc has the bulk of what disc two of the two disc set had but there are a couple of additions worth noting. There's also a multi-angle storyboard comparison (which I believe to be new). I couldn't find the UPA cartoons on the original but haven't had a chance to investigate all the noons and crannies of the three disc set.<br /><br />Disc three has a new video introduction by Ron Perlman. Here we get a video and audio commentary by the main actors(in fact it's the same as the audio commentary from the previous edition only this time we see the actors as they recorded their commentary and also see the movie as their watching it in a picture-in-picture mode). There's production workshops also included here, make up and lighting tests (although all involve the final make up for Hellboy), "A Quick Guide to Understanding Comics with Scott McCloud"--a featurette. Mike Mignola is absent from the commentary track but his pre-production artwork is included here. Ther's also the director's notebook (again--it's on two discs here for some strange reason), conceptual art galleries and comic book artists pin-ups on the last disc as well. Personally, I would have put the actors in pip mode vs. the movie as the version they're commenting on it is the theatrical release not the Director's Cut. Not sure why Columbia chose not to do this. Aside from that minor complaint (and not being able to find the UPA cartoons), this is the ultimate fan boy edition. Oh, there's also a reproduction of part of Rasputin's diary by Mignola as well included in paperback form.<br /><br />The packaging is nice with three slimline DVD holders highlight Red, Blue and Liz. Personally, I would also like to have had a booklet similar to the one that came with the two discs set. Also, I'm unclear why the "seamlessly branching" DVD technology wasn't here to allow both the director's cut and the theatrical editions (much like "Alien" and "Aliens"). I don't have any use for keeping the previous edition (it was traded in) just for the theatrical cut (and I personally feel the Director's Cut is a superior version of the movie even though most of the changes are fairly minor overall).<br /><br />Overall, this is a terrific boxed set that has some minor flaws. Hopefully Columbia will learn from this mistake and correct any future releases of Director's Cuts vs. theatrical editions. Also, releasing both at the same time so fans can make a choice (vs. being double dipped) would be the right thing to do from a customer service stand point. Plus, there wouldn't be all those used copies eating away at their sales of the set.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>"There lived a certain man in Russia long ago<br />He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow"<br />("Rasputin" by Boney M)<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1.

The Nazis tried to open up hell! And that's just for starters!<br /><br />What determines a man? That is the question posed at the beginning and the ending of this fun flick steeped in horror and sci-fi and poured out as a quaffable entertainment. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Ron Perlman glows as Hellboy, aptly named as the only thing to survive the explosion to close the gate to Hell. Those closing it are American agents from the Bureau of the Paranormal situated in the States. After defeating the Nazis in the opening scene, they manage to capture little Hell baby who is so cute with his red skin and huge right clay hand and horn knobs on his forehead. Th agents from the Bureau of the Paranormal take him home. After all, he is, well, paranormal.<br /><br />Hellboy grows up with two companions: Abe Sapiens, sort of amphibious man, and Elizabeth, a firestarter. The professor teaches each how to control and utilize their special skills. The viewer learns this during the rolling of the story. We next meet Hellboy as an adult--and here I was expecting fearful scenes, but Hellboy loves cats. That settled it for this viewer. Cats everywhere in his cozy apartment. The professor has trained Hellboy to eliminate monsters. But that is how he is trained. The question again: What manner of man is he?<br /><br />The question is answered in the last action scene. John, the agent assigned as his special assistant makes the case that a man is determined by his choices, what decisions he makes. Man is not destined to be one thing or another. There has always been choice. The fact that the choice is played out in battle with a multitude of hell creatures and a hell monster makes the decision even more memorable.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended film! It is campy, creepy, and with context and comraderie. It't quite different from what you might expect!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>While some good directors never quite "get it," it took Guillermo Del Toro only one misfire -- the icky, slow-paced "Blade 2" -- to get the whole comic-book adaptation thing right.<br /><br />In fact, just about everything is right with "Hellboy" -- Del Toro crafted an action blockbuster with a grimy, slimy cult-movie feel and a quirky sense of humor.

He's funny and violent and vulnerable, perfect.  If he doesn't work, the film doesn't. One thing that I disagree with about the film is that it shouldn't be rated pg-13.  There's a lot a violent and gruesome content in this film and it's combined with occultic themes, kids shouldn't be seeing this stuff, that's all.  I had the same quibbles with the Lord of the Rings, they pushes R rated violence into the pg-13 territory because they wanted to make their money back. Enough of my puritanical rant, I just feel that this movie earns the R and doesn't end up getting it, that's all. By the way, kudos to Jeffrey Tambor, who plays a character who you don't like and is still OK to like at the end because he's such a obnoxious dufus. To all who've seen it, I hope you stuck around for the credits to catch a little bit more of him.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Hellboy, when it was first announced as a film project, shocked me because I kept trying to figure out how it was going to be made.  First I pondered the budget necessary to make a film version of Mike Migola's insanely cool comic without making it look stupid and cheap.  Second I worried greatly about the director.  Last, I couldn't even begin to think about who the hell would play Hellboy.<br /><br />Amazing as it seems, the budget was more than adequate, the director more than capable (Guillermo del Toro), and the actor playing Hellboy (Ron Perlman) was, is, and always will be the film incarnation of the big red guy.  In fact, if I had my way I'd nominate Perlman for an Academy Award (and in doing so validate those frivolities very existence).  Betcha it don't happen though.<br /><br />This film is the grandest presentation of a fanboy project since The Fellowship of the Ring, made all the more amazing by the fact that the source material is a borderline underground comic.  Del Toro's genius is in proving that great film making can come from the semi-obscure.<br /><br />Every shot with Hellboy is eyecatching, and with the special effects teams involved it's no wonder.  From creature animation, to backgrounds the best of the best had there hand in this film.<br /><br />While Hellboy is bad ass, Abe Sapien is perhaps one of the most beautiful creature creations brought to film ever, kind of like the Creature from the Black Lagoon with a yen for book learning instead of white bikinis.  Liz, is a Firestarter that would roast Drew Barrymore like some leftover cocktail weenie.<br /><br />Throw in a tick tock man made of gears and cogs who was a nazi super assassin, the mad monk Rasputin, and several demon/gods from hell and you've got an action/horror hybrid that's enough to put any SFX junkie into joy riddled convulsions.<br /><br />The best part about this movie (aside from the reported sequel in the works) is that it increased the world's knowledge exponentially of the wonderful comic by Mike Mignola.  People are now seeking out the haunting artwork and surreal storytelling of Hellboy and I envy anyone their first glance into Mignola's imagination.<br /><br />Now for one last thing, apparently a director's cut is on the way, and while on the one hand I feel cheated, I also find myself curious.  I'm having a psychic moment, it involves the future and a willfull relinquishing of hard earned funds.  Hopefully it will be worth it.  I know the original theatrical release was.

But even Satan can fall in love with another freak of his type and even Satan can be attached to the catholic professor who became his father, the one who provided him with candy and sweets, because Satan has a sweet tooth. Satan somewhere is slightly human and a tiny bit catholic. A cross may burn his palm but when it has been served to him for sixty years by a benevolent old man who he considers his father he may start to like it, to love him and then to hate those who are on the other side. Don't expect any kind of deep emotional feelings though but expect some beautiful special effects that look so realistic that they will make you thrill and shiver. And what's more they will be exotic and lead you to rainy New York City and snowy Moscow and underground everywhere, in the NYC subway or in some Russian cemetery. You will meet with dead people who are revived and then can lead you to the very center of hell, or with surgical fetishists who have recomposed their bodies bone by bone and muscle by muscle. But the most attractive element is in the use of fire, the fascination with fire and that has to do with the constant reference to the apocalypse, that of the Book of Revelation of course? Fire seen as the ultimate cleansing element that can bring the universe to its end or destroy up all evil from earth. The ambivalence of this fire is fairly surprising in many ways since most people are afraid of fire and here it is the ultimate redeeming element. It is true when you are surrounded by meters of snow and tons of ice you are grateful for one little small fire in the living room hearth. And be satisfied: the FBI director who is in charge will end up locked up underground to die peacefully, at least deep enough for no one to be pestered by his protest and yelling.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro was the ideal director for this adaptation of Mike Mignola's comic, given his love for clockwork, monsters, the occult and romanticism. This is a popcorn movie that carries the real strength of its own convictions, and as such its really a pleasure to watch. The whole thing is a mix of Jack Kirby monster comics, Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, and (particularly) the Indiana Jones films, particularly in the use of Nazis and the occult, and its peculiar zest for pop culture is part of what makes the whole thing so much fun. It also seems very similar to the beloved TV series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in its vision of the heartaches of adolescence seen as a kind of literal hell, although her the misfit teenagers don't just fight monsters but ARE themselves monsters too: Hellboy himself (definitively played by Ron Perlman) has a gigantic body and a surface cynicism and contempt for authority, but deep down he's simply a big boy trying to fit in and at the mercy of his emotional vulnerability. He may file down his horns, but he can't help wearing his heart on his sleeve.<br /><br />The film's villains are spectacularly loathsome, with a clockwork Nazi assassin wearing a gas-mask clearly del Toro's favorite character in the film; he is killed and re-born perhaps too many times for the viewer to care much by the time he is finally (?) destroyed. Indeed, the film's greatest trouble is that it seems to keep concluding over and over again, which gets to be a little wearing. It is also a bit loud and jumbled at the end: it's best sequences by far are in the first third, when del Toro allows a sense of childlike wonder to dominate as we are introduced to the beautiful interiors that are always the hallmark of his films. There's also a wonderful character named Abe who is a delicate merman of enhanced psychic abilities; he is voiced by David Hyde Pierce but physically acted by the great Doug Jones, who makes the character's movements a real thing of beauty and amazement. (When he gets shunted aside by all the monsters at the end you greatly miss his presence.) This twin DVD set is filled with every sort of background story of both the film and its characters you could imagine, and should be a real treat for all Hellboy fanboys and fangirls.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>I haven't read much Hellboy, but I've read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593070942">enough</a> to know it's a damn good story.  There are comics that really shouldn't be made into movies and there are comics that are begging to be made into movies.  This falls into the latter category.  Take the major potential of the book and pair it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a>'s Guillermo del Toro (who is a major fan of the comic), and you've got a recipe for an epically awesome film that puts any of the recent super hero flicks to shame.<br /><br />However, Hellboy suffers from a weak beginning.  The opening scene--which is admittedly necessary for the rest of the story--comes off as really cheesy and badly acted.  The introduction of the titular character, the charismatic, gruff, and vulnerable Hellboy played wonderfully by Ron Perlman, makes the movie better, but it still doesn't seem to get its grounding until halfway through.  The dialogue and a lot of the plot is really campy, but somewhere along the middle, that aspect of the movie turns from annoying to endearing.  This movie isn't for everyone, because not everyone can take this level of camp, but for those who can stick it out, there is a really good story here.<br /><br />Always telling his story with beautiful images, del Toro drives this film forward with scene after scene of character and plot development, at once showing the kind of 'man' Hellboy is, and showing how bad the situation he is in is.  From the middle point to the apocalyptic end, this movie doesn't miss a beat.  It's funny, it's action packed, it's tear-jerking, and the end is thought-provoking; if only del Toro had put as much thought into the beginning of the film as he did the rest of it, this movie would get top marks.<br /><br />I will without a doubt be seeing the sequel in theaters.<br /><br />7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In 1944, the Nazis and German scientists with the aid of legendary Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) are conducting experiments in black magic. They have created a special dimensional portal machine that can summon a powerful demon god from another dimension to bring armageddon to the world but it failed. Paranormalist Professor Trevor Broom Brutterholm (John Hurt) and a band of soldiers discover a harmless baby devil-like demon with short non-sharp horns from hell as they raise him to be an avenging creature that defends people and destroys evil nicknamed Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Sixty years later, Rasputin has been resurrection as now he joins forces with zombie-like nazi soldier Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) and sexy Illsa (Biddy Hodson) as they must attempt to try to bring the demon god to create the apocalypse. Now it's up to Professor Broom's Beauru for Paranormal Research squad lead by Hellboy with the help of kind hearted, intelligent and telepathic merman named Abe Sapien (Voiced by David Hyde Pierce and played by Doug Jones) and gorgeous pyrokinetic woman Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) as they face off some deadly demons and try to save the world.<br /><br />Superb horror comedy fantasy adventure from the brilliant Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro ("Blade II", "Pan's Labyrinth" and "Cronos") and based on the popular cult Dark Horse comic "Hellboy" by Mike Mignola who was one of the producers of this movie. It's faithfully adapts the brilliant comic book to life thanks to the director's vision, Ron Perlman was born to play the title hero and just fits the bill the right way! Hellboy's make-up was created by Rick Baker ("An American Werewolf in London") and the creature effects especially on Abe Sapien are fantastic. The film co-stars Jeffrey Tambor, Rupert Evans and Brian Steele as the entire cast gives out wonderful performances and there's good action sequences. I love how the film has a mix of fantasy with H.P. Lovecraft-esque themes to it and of course some good timed humor mixed in, this is one of the greatest comic book movies in recent memory and a true must see! i can't wait for the sequel this summer.<br /><br />This 3-Disc DVD contains the unrated director's cut with never before seen footage not shown in the theatrical cut with hours of awesome extras.

The director of this tale is Mexican director Guillermo del Toro.<br /><br />(2) The film based is on the Dark Horse Comics work Hellboy: Seed of Destruction by Mike Mignola.<br /><br />(3) Released in 2004, it earned $60 million at the U.S. box office, and $100 million worldwide<br /><br />(4) Hellboy comes into existence when Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin along with aid of the Nazi's on the shores of Scotland opens a portal to the otherworld of Ogdru Jahad, evil entities. Rasputin wants to unleash them on the Earth so as to destroy the Earth. At the time of the opening, due to the ensuing confusion and going of of a grenade when the Americans attack the nazi's, Rasputing gets sucked into the otherworld and a little demon baby with horns with one hand of stone and one normal hand happens to zip from the otherworld to the real world. He is raised by  Professor Trevor Bruttenholm who becomes the head of the Bureau of Paranormal Research & Defense.  60 years forward, a grown fish boy only 20 something in demomn years , a fish-like being named Abe Sapien, who has very advanced psychic abilities, and Liz Sherman, a pyrokinetic who has yet to learn to control her pyrotechnic abilities and is implied to have unintentionally injured people when overly emotional team up against the re-emergence of Rasputin, and work to foil him plans of his unfinished task of unleashing the Ogdru Jahad from the other world. Incidentally the Ogdru Jahad can be unleashed only using the Stone hand of Helloboy which acts as the key to the lock.<br /><br />(5) There is a nice ligh moment in the movie featuring a potential love trianlge between John Myers, Liz Sherman and Hellboy. The scenes of Hellboy getting jealous over John trying to hit on Liz provide a nice comic relief.<br /><br />(6) Great Visuals. Outlandish and authentic comic book type production design. Great looking menacing creatures. This is not just a special effects super hero movie, its a superhero movie with large themes, well etched characters that you care for, and an epic comic book drama feel to it.<br /><br />...Guillermo del Toro got it just right.

I loved this movie. The colors are rich, the effects are top notch, and it has some pretty good action sequences. Guillermo del Toro is an excellent director. The dvd has four cartoons as extras and the Tell Tale Heart is pretty amazing. I thought the second disc was unneccesary. Still, a great buy if you like action movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the world of comic books there are many well known heroes that populate the various universes of each publishing company's books. From DC Comics' popular characters of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman to Marvel's Spiderman, X-Men, and Fantastic Four; each of those characters are beloved by comic book fans worldwide. Aside from those characters and their respective companies there are numerous other characters that have built a cult following in the comic world, but are not as well known by the mainstream public. One such character would be the Dark Horse comic book Hellboy, created by writer/artist Mike Mignola.<br /><br />In theaters many of Marvel and DC's heroes have been finding their way to the big screen with varying degrees of success, most are wildly successful, but a few have faltered along the way, but not too many of the other companies have managed to bring their properties to life with as much success. Sure, there was "Spawn" (property of Image Comics) and "Judge Dredd" (British publication called '2000 A.D.') in the mid-nineties, but they weren't all that successful, so the likelihood of these little known characters finding success with movie audiences was slim to none. At least that was the case until director Guillermo del Toro ("Blade 2") passed on an opportunity to direct the 3rd installment in the 'Harry Potter' franchise, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", to bring one of his favorite comic characters to life.<br /><br />With a successful director, such as Guillermo behind the lens, New Line Cinema must have felt fairly confident in the film's success after he had done wonders for them with the second installment in the 'Blade' trilogy, so with a director on board who respected the source material, and a talented cast of actors consisting of Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, and John Hurt, this little known comic book was about to become a living, breathing reality on the silver screen.<br /><br />"Hellboy" begins in 1944 during World War 2, when Rasputin, a mad sorcerer in league with Hitler, opens a dimensional portal to Hell, and through this dimension a baby demon emerges. Before Rasputin can take the baby demon and raise him to be an instrument of death and destruction, the Allied forces stop him. Among the Allies, is a young man who raises this demon, appropriately named Hellboy, teaching him the ways of the hero. As an adult, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) works with an agency known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, founded by the very man that raised him Professor Bloom (John Hurt), their job is to track any paranormal activity on Earth, and protect humanity from any danger that may be the result of that activity. Now, 60 years after releasing Hellboy on Earth, Rasputin has returned with the intention of using Hellboy to unleash the 7 gods of chaos upon Earth. With Earth's survival hanging in the balance, Hellboy and company, consisting of the firestarter Liz (Selma Blair), a human/amphibian hybrid named Abe Sapien (acted out by Doug Jones, but voiced by David Hyde Pierce), and FBI agent Myers, are in for the most difficult fight of their lives.<br /><br />After finding moderate success in Hollywood with the science-fiction/horror movie "Mimic", and following that up with his much more successful comic book hit "Blade 2", director Guillermo del Toro probably seemed without a doubt the best choice to bring Hellboy to the big screen. Not only is Guillermo a gifted director in the arena of special effects and horror, but he also has a knack for making his characters have a sense of humor which serves to lighten the mood in his otherwise darker toned movies, those elements combined together with his affection for the source material created the optimal conditions for another comic book movie franchise to be born, proving him the right man for the job.<br /><br />After Guillermo signed on, it was time to build the cast for the project. Now, I'm sure casting for this movie was probably typical by most comic book movie standards, but the difficult part had to have been finding the right man to don the red paint and prosthetics that are used to create Hellboy's demonic visage. Enter actor Ron Perlman ("Alien: Resurrection"), an actor that has made a career of playing somewhat strange, even scary characters, and who by the way is no stranger to wearing plenty of prosthetics. After all, Ron Perlman's best known role was that of the Beast in the live-action TV series "Beauty and the Beast" opposite actress Linda Hamilton ("The Terminator"), so with his experience with prosthetics and his penchant for strange characters, it was almost as if he was destined to be this character. The supporting cast members do very well with providing depth and reality to these strange new heroes that join together to face monsters determined to destroy us. There really wasn't a weak actor/actress in the entire bunch, a true rariety in the various genres that this movie fits into, i.e. horror, science-fiction, comic book. It was a welcome addition that everyone involved on screen and off appeared to have a deep respect for the source material and the fan base, and not just being there to collect a paycheck.<br /><br />The special effects for the movie were very well done, especially the scenes with Liz's fire power being showcased. These scenes are where the CGI really shines. As I touched on earlier, the prosthetics and costume department also deserves great praise for their oustanding work done here, from Hellboy to the monsters that he faces, to Abe Sapien or Kronen, every aspect of costumes, prosthetics, and practical effects is top-notch all the way. And finally, the story for "Hellboy" was very fast paced and entertaining, without skimming on the details of the character, which I appreciated greatly due to my lack of awareness in regards to this comic book. Without this entertaining and engaging story that was smartly written to play well with audiences that would be hard-core fans of the comic and those that have either little or no knowledge of the character whatsoever.<br /><br />With all of that being said, "Hellboy" is a terrific comic book based movie, that as far as I know, stays true to the source material without making newcomers to the character feel lost in the shuffle. Definitely a solid entry into the pantheon of comic book movies and a welcome addition at that.<br /><br />"Hellboy" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>First off let me say,I've never read a comic book in my life.I never found you had to read the comics to understand or love the films.And Hellboy was no expection.I never even heard of the comic book created by Mike Mignola (I'm sure some people hadn't heard of it too).<br /><br />Ron Perlman was born to play Hellboy,he was so perfectly cast has the half-human,half-demon..You just can't see anyone else play this character.John Hurt was good as Professor Broom,the man who raised Hellboy and I didn't reconize him at all,I knew lthe voice but couldn't place the face.Selma Blair who's an actress who sometimes really annoys me,but this time she didn't.<br /><br />Directed by Guillermo del Toro,whom turned down the chance to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to do this,did a great job and not really changing the story like most directors do with Comic Book films.If someone else directed Hellboy it wouldn't have been as great as it was</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>It's another comic book rendered into live action. On the whole, it's pretty good. The WWII Germans are the bad guys, our flawed Hellboy is the hero, and he gets the hot female lead in the last scene. Yes, I said hot.<br /><br />The pace is good, the attitude is bad (that's good), and the effects are good. The visual presentation helps move the story along. For example, almost the entire first sequence is bluish monochrome with two colored exceptions: Our Hero is red, and the Evil Babe's lipstick is red. That tells you who to watch. OK, it's not subtle, but this is a comic. I'll look elsewhere for subtlety.<br /><br />(BTW, I've never read Hellboy comics. I probably won't start, even though I liked the movie. Lots of other comics are good, too, and my preferences lie in other directions.)<br /><br />Maybe you like comics. Maybe you like action movies based on over-the-top characters. Maybe you want a flick that's exciting enough, but where people stay mostly dressed and the gore is kept under control. If so, the movie has a fair bit to offer. Go ahead, enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I heared that Hellboy was off a comic book. Hellboy is near classic of great proportion as played by the underrated Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast) Perlman is an actor you probley wouldn't recognize as he has had to wear so much facial make up in his career. Also he played in a lot of low budget movies. He imbues 'Hellboy' with a real humanity and a scathing wit. How am I ever gonna get a girl when I drive around in a garbage truck? John Hurt as his father has a little to do but that he loves Hellboy there is no doubt having to rescued him on the night he came from hell. Dr. Broom adopts the boy and they live at the Center For Paranormal Studies in New Jersey with a fish like creature and a fire starter girl who Hellboy loves to pieces.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Hellboy is the movie based on the comic book that I hadn't even ever heard about. Well anyway, if the comic's half as good as this, it will be good! This is a very good superhero movie about Hellboy. He's big, red, has a big tail and a big gun. He's bigger, badder, and stronger than the other red superhero guy, your friendly neighborhood spiderman. Well ,anyway, in this movie, he's got to fight evil and stop world domination from a bunch of nutcases. One vilain particualrily cool has some big blades that come out from his hands. Hellboy also has to fight some crazy weird looking monsters alongside an FBI agent who's trying to steal his girl.<br /><br />What makes this movie work is the great action and the hilarious humor. Ron Perlman's great as Hellboy and has some good one liners. This one didn't even look that good to me, but for a superhero movie, this one's great.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>While I didn't follow the comic I did like two things about this movie. Ron Perlman's lead as Hellboy and creator Mike Mignola's creation being done faithfully. He didn't sell this character to Marvel and DC and still got the movie made.  I hope there is a sequel.  Unlike Spawn, which didn't have the personality of Ron Perlman's character, didn't have any successful comebacks.  Without getting too deep into the story I have to say it was a good film I would see again.  The action was in abundance in this one so you never got bored.<br /><br />This was the same Ron Pealman who was in Beauty and the Beast. Now why didn't someone make a movie about that series?</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>If you liked Raiders of the Lost Ark, MIB, Star Wars, and any super hero movie over the last twenty years or so, you should like Hellboy.  One reason may be that Hellboy lifts, pretty blatantly, from a number of those films.  You will find yourself often recalling scenes from other films.  And that's ok, Spielburg has made quite a career from such a practice, though his lift jobs are usually from older, somewhat forgotten greats.  Hellboy just says to heck with this memory thing, and lets rip. To some extent this makes for a crowded movie.  In contrast, look how Spiderman makes much of just one super villain per movie.<br /><br />Perlman is excellent as Hellboy. He plays the part like some orange, mutant looking, cigar chomping, Sgt. Fury.  Also of note, is Liz (played by the lovely Selma Blair) as the Firestarter.  She's just one of those actresses that has "It," just by being on screen (see: Scarlet Johansson).  The story is basically a comic book, the violence, bloodless.  You got those reliable bad guys, the Nazis (with some help from Rasputin) seeking to open up another world and let the tentacled baddies come rolling in (very Cthulu Mythos by the way).  Hellboy slugs and wisecracks his way through the evil mumbo jumbo, while keeping a protective eye out for his beloved Liz, who can take care of herself in a very explosive way.  That's pretty much it.  Nothing great, but definitely worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro's HELLBOY is one of the best comic book movies I have ever seen. Ranking up there with BATMAN RETURNS and SPIDER-MAN, this is a fantastic example of everything a movie of this genre should have: Great action, spectacle without overkill, story before style and a leading man who carries the whole movie on his broad shoulders. Ron Pearlman is unquestionably the perfect guy for the role, eschewing the usual moody, anti-heroes of previous CB movies that tried (And failed) at setting the bar for excellence, this is a film that rides on no ones coattails, instead shows off its originality well. The music is brooding and stylish, the supporting cast is excellent and the villains are great fun. So what else is there to say?  If you haven?t seen it, go see it now, and if you have already, then see it again. Now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Hellboy is one of the best action movies ever made. Hellboy contains lots of laughs and edge-of-your seat action.

The romance story in the movie was such that even guys will like it. (honest!) <p>Good versus evil is always a powerful theme when executed well. The story that even a demon can choose redemption lends an almost-new level to the genre, except that Spawn and Blade have already explored that idea.<p>Hellboy is a super hero for the ages. I do believe this will be an enduring classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When I first heard about HELLBOY, I wasn't very impressed and had no intentions of seeing the movie. Then I saw some of the previews and my interest was piqued. After talking with some friends who had seen the film, I decided I really wanted to see this movie. I was not disappointed.<p>HELLBOY begins in 1944 Scotland. Hitler has been organizing a paranormal team for sometime, led by the infamous Russian Zarist advisor, Rasputin. President Roosevelt has dispatched a team to stop the evil scum before they release the dark powers from another realm. The Americans succeed in thwarting the Nazis' plan and Rasputin is sucked into the nether regions. However, before the victory, something from the great beyond came through the portal. That something turns out to be a little red demon with a huge stone fist. The Americans are entranced by the creature and name him Hellboy. Hellboy is adopted and raised by Professor Trevor Bloom (John Hurt) and the two become prominent, but hidden members of the secret paranormal branch of the FBI. Years later Rasputin is resurrected and it's up to Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Professor Bloom, Agent John Myers, and their staff to rid the world of the Rasputin menance.<p>Ron Perlman portrays Hellboy and he's embodies the character just as good, if not better than Tobey Maguire as Spiderman or Christopher Reeves as Superman. I don't think there is any other actor alive who could have captured the nuances of Hellboy so well. Heck, I'll go so far as to say that if Hollywood ever really seriously considered acting nominations for action/sci-fi pictures (they should consider all films, but they don't), Perlman would have one in the bag. The other supporting actors do a good job, too, but besides Perlman I especially enjoyed the performance of John Hurt, he's one of the most underrated character actors of our time.<p>The action in HELLBOY is typical of a comic book flick and some might hold that against the movie. Still, it is a comic book flick and for that, it's pretty good stuff. There is some fairly witty and original dialogue in the script and the direction of Guillermo del Toro holds everything in place. There are a few words of foul language here and there, but nothing that is out of place.<p>In fact, my only complaint about the film is that the villans are completely underdeveloped.  Most of the good guys have some sort of character development during the screen time (though Abe Sapien doesn't get a whole lot). However, the bad guys; and especially Rasputin, don't get any development at all. This is a little disappointing because Rasputin is such an interesting character and the film could have been even better with just a little more character development upon him. Other than that, though, HELLBOY is one rip-roaring good time.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Here?s come another one ? another feature film adaptation of a classic comic book series. Ever since the comic book genre was revitalized by X-Men in 2000 and elevated to escalating popularity thanks to Spider-Man in 2003, it has been the top priority of every major movie studio in Hollywood to jump on the latest band wagon and grab a comic book franchise in which to roll several features, if at all possible. Granted that most of the major comic book series have been picked up and the only ones left are the less well-known franchises, but aren?t the filmmakers that choose these projects all the more braver then those with the so-called ?sure-fire? hits?  Guillermo del Toro hasn?t clearly shown that after taking the directing reins in the already hot Blade film franchise for Blade II, which managed successful to out-gross the original, but now he really gets to show how brave of a filmmaker he is with a project he?s been working on for nearly six years. After shopping the experimental project around for quite some time, del Toro will now have the shot to bring the cult-classic to life but whether or not his hard work will pay off is still in the air.<p>The story follows a young devil brought to Earth through a pagan ritual and saved by the United States Army on his journey to grow up and become a man. Nearly sixty years ago, the Nazis, in a last ditch effort to win the war against the Allied Powers, stage a cult experiment to unleash the seven gods of Chaos and destroy the world, all being led by the mysterious Grigori Rasputin. But when the United States Army intervenes, the lurid experiment goes awry and, as a result, tares the child of Satan, later named Hellboy, from his home. After he is adopted by Professor Bruttenholm, Hellboy is brought up as a force of good, rather then evil, working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, protecting the world from all supernatural forces that may threaten it. His latest mission brings him in touch with the Nazi cult followers that brought him into the world sixty years ago, only this time they are adamantly determined to finish the job they started, which includes using Hellboy to fulfill his true purpose ? unleashing the seven gods of Chaos and bringing about the end of the world. The story for Hellboy, as confusing and outlandish as it may seem, was surprisingly quite interesting but is definitely one that requires not necessarily a true understanding of the comic book series it is based on but an awareness of historical figures that the feature presents, as well as the legends surrounding those characters. If you go into this film without at least a reasonable sense of what is going on, you?re not going to understand one solitary thing within this film. In that case, don?t bother going at all ? you?re just going to waste your money.<p>Unlike other comic book adaptations, Hellboy does not feature a whole lot of A-list talent but none-the-less features one of the most impressive casts this year, despite several flaws that become evident as the feature progresses. Ron Perlman is Hellboy, no ifs, ands, or buts about it! Perlman was apparently the major requirement by Guillermo del Toro when he shopped around the project and was one of the major setbacks for the project as well with the studios wanting someone more famous to play the red hero. Fortunately for movie-goers, del Toro stuck to his guns and showcases a real eye for talent with Perlman?s marvelous performance. John Hurt, who portrays Professor Bruttenholm, gives a delightful performance of a character that cares dearly for his adopted son but knows clearly that his time on Earth is running out. You can?t help but have a tear in your eye during his final scene in the film. There were few problems with the cast but the ones that were contrary to the rest were quite evident, this included Jeffrey Tambor and Karel Roden. It wasn?t necessarily their performances but the characters themselves. Tambor plays some-what of an adversary to Hellboy in the course but you never exactly get an idea why this is. Perhaps he?s the typical ?uptight governmental agent who fears people different from him and therefore looks unkindly toward ?freaks? like Hellboy? ? in that case, this just makes the character rather a lame addition to the overall story. And Roden as Rasputin? You just don?t see enough of him to care or clearly grasp what he?s doing in the film or trying to achieve.<p>Overall, Hellboy lands up in purgatory, it is neither a hit nor a miss, not necessarily leaving you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you. What it does leave you with is the feeling of wanting to know what the Hell (no pun intended) was going on and how it all makes sense, one way or another ? a thing del Toro never clearly demonstrates in this film. First off, the feature, though only lasting a little over two hours, feels a lot longer then it actually is especially with several seemingly endless chase scenes. Secondly, it felt as though too much was being crammed into one film and might have been better split up but with enough problems getting this first one made it is understandable why del Toro might have trouble getting a sequel. Third, there were several prominent instances where it felt as though the over-the-topness of the film was too much, including the scenes with Kroenen waving his swords around like that guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Many were expecting someone to pull a gun out, shoot the Nazi SOB, and move on from there but that never came about. And finally, concerning Kroenan, how does that work out? The man (figuring he is even human) is mostly dust but continues to do the things he does over a nearly sixty year time span ? how is that possible? What keeps him, supposedly, alive? And what makes the last scene with him seem like the end of his character? Guess that?s asking too much. Hellboy, in the end, becomes a comic-book fanatic?s dream but the for the rest it leaves them confused.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>One of the better Marvel Comic / Movie crossovers of late with a powerhouse performance by Ron Perlman in the title role, who delivers the character which such panache, you can forgive the other disappointing aspects of the movie. A typical pulp storyline finds the birth of Hellboy by a Nazi ritual interuppted by well to do professor figure who he comes to know as father, and then we are moved hence 60 odd years. Hellboy is now on our side thankfully, but we are then only to find (shock horror) that the original protagonists have re-emerged to finish their aim of World destruction yada yada yada. Top heavy on the SfX as you would expect, but the success lies in the movies persistent, and almost self effacing script; that refuses to try and overlay a topical, or politically correct message, as so many other movies of the genre have in the past. The film seems to know it's implausible and often silly beyond belief, but the acting is perfectly executed. Any moments of stale screen time are soon enlivened with some beautifully delivered lines, again by Perlman, who almost single handedly carries the whole picture. A lot of fun here for young and old, and should appeal to those outside the 14-22 demographic for whom it seems to have been intended for by the director. Your intellect won't be tested too much, but if you know that going in, you should enjoy this movie. Deserves 3.5 stars, but not quite 4.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This is one of the more original movies that I have seen in<br />quite some time.Hellboy was originally a comic book hero.He is<br />called in from the dark side by Rasputin and the Nazis.He is a<br />baby devil,red,with horns and a tail,and an armored right arm.<br />Instead of becoming a tool of evil he is raised by the professor<br />who raises him to be a good guy.He fights monsters while smoking cigars,drinking Bud light,and showing a very good sense of humor.<br />He has a fish man and a pyrotechnic woman as partners.Rasputin<br />returns to the scene with some very evil monsters.Hellboy and<br />Rasputin have a final showdon in Russia.This is an outstanding movie that has some unique villians and heros.The scenery and special effects are outstanding as well.See this movie,you will enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;Hellboy&quot; is the movie adapted from a comic book for people who did not read the comic book, which, in this case, would be me. That means I was free of any and all preconceptions regarding characters, casting, and plot this time around, unlike previous experiences with Batman, Spider-Man, and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. But even from a tabula rassa perspective it is hard to believe that anybody other than Ron Perlman could have played the title role in &quot;Hellboy.&quot;<br /><br /> The first key point about this movie is that &quot;Hellboy&quot; works even before Perlman shows up as Big Red and takes over the movie. We begin in 1944 in Scotland, where a bunch of Nazis have shown up in order to open an inter-dimensional portal to the dark side and summon forth the Seven Gods of Chaos. True, this is going to end the world, which is probably a bit more than Hitler was bargaining for, but it seems that the original Russian mad monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), his Aryan bride of death Ilsa (Bridget Hodson), and the blade loving Nazi psycho Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) have a slightly different agenda. Fortunately, young Professor Trevor Broom (Kevin Trainor), FDR's psychic advisor, and the U.S. Army stop the Nazi plot. The portal is closed, but not before a little red-skinned horned demon comes through from the other side.<br /><br /> We jump ahead to the present, where the rumored sightings of Hellboy are a tabloid staple. Young clean-cut F.B.I. agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) becomes a part of the agency's Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense where Professor Broom (John Hurt) introduces him to &quot;Abe&quot; Sapien (Doug Jones does the acting but the voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce), a fish like mind-reader/psychic and the adult Hellboy in all of his glory. Meanwhile, sixty years later Rasputin and his sidekicks are back again and have managed to unleash a monster from inside a statue at the museum. The fun part about this particular monster is that every time you kill one, two more are born to take its place. Hellboy has his work cut out for him this time, but Rasputin and Kroenen do something that makes this really personal for our hero.<br /><br /> But the ending of the world as we know it is a minor problem compared to Hellboy's love life, which is fixated on the melancholy Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). She is a pyrokineticist who bursts into flames when she gets excited or angry. He is a seven-foot red skinned demon from another dimension who is impervious to fire, so it is clearly a perfect match. But once John convinces Liz to come back to the fold they start spending time together, forcing Hellboy to sneak around on rooftops spying on them. However, this is all just a prelude to the final showdown with the bad guys and their monsters. More than any other comic book superhero on the big screen, Hellboy really takes a pounding. But the big guy keeps coming back for more.<br /><br /> Perlman is pitch perfect as Hellboy, his baritone voice providing depth to the character beyond the awesome makeup job. Working from Mike Mignola's Dark Horse comic books, director Guillermo del Toro (&quot;Blade II&quot;) creates a suitable gothic atmosphere for Hellboy to have his knockdown drag out battles. But the star here is Perlman's Hellboy. This is pitch-perfect casting and Perlman is even better here than he was as Vincent on television's &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot; If anything, he is bigger and better than the movie he is in, which is a pretty good accomplishment for a comic book movie. This guy watches out for kittens during a fight. What is not to love about Hellboy?<br /><br /> The bonus disc for this DVD is even better, especially for those who like to see the nuts and bolts of making a movie. There are two commentary tracks, the first by the creative forces of director Guillermo del Toro and the comic book's Mike Mignola, the second with actors Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor. The documentary, &quot;Hellboy: The Seeds of Creation,&quot; is longer than the movie and you can spend hours going through everything. Be sure you find the illustrated biographies of the characters along with all the scene by scene comparisons available. I rated the movie, which is arguably the second best superhero movie of the century after &quot;Spider-Man 2,&quot; a 4.5 and was going to round down, but that is impossible with this bonus disc.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>I was expecting something along the lines of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen when I caved in to go see Hellboy last night; you know, a bunch of unlikely paranormal misfit heroes working together to save the world from destruction.  Okay, well, it was a lot like TLEG in theory, but much better in practice. Comic books turned into movies don?t normally thrill me, but in this movie it wasn?t difficult for me to suspend my disbelief in spite of some stretched plot lines.<p>Ron Perlman plays Hellboy, who is apparently an imp from a rift in the universe that occurred as a result of tampering by the German army during WW2.  Something went terribly wrong with their ?experiment?, resulting in a few people and things being sucked in from our universe to the other side in exchange for?what? before the hole was shut down.  He is raised lovingly in an American government facility by the bespectacled professor that discovered/rescued him in Scotland.  A couple of other paranormal misfits ? Liz the firestarter  and Abe the blue psychic fish man ? are basically his adopted siblings.  The trio is trained to use their powers for heroic good.  Their existence is of course top secret, which explains why there are public rumors everywhere about Hellboy.<p>But wait?those nahtzis (spelled wrongly on purpose!) aren?t dead yet! They have unleashed Hellish creatures upon our world, which only multiply when they are slain.  In fact they?ve come back for the now-grown Hellboy sixty years later so that he can complete his destiny, which is somehow tied in with reopening that rift between universes.  The legendary Rasputin (who has occultic powers of his own) has concocted this plot to lure Hellboy and his entourage for a final showdown in Moscow.  <p>The plot had its flaws but the visuals had none.  I liked the action sequences and special effects, which centered mainly on the multi-tentacled creatures that Hellboy and co. spend most of the movie destroying.  CGI and makeup were used flawlessly to create the human and beastly monsters.  There was also a nice romance subplot between Liz (Selma Blair) and Hellboy, which begged the question; can a man overcome the monster within himself for the sake of love?  Yes, echoes of Perlman?s former tv role, but with a lot more testosterone and realistic emotions.  It was a surprisingly UNcheesy love story amidst all the action.<p>I could have wished for more backstory about Abe and Liz, but that?s my only real gripe.  It comes down to this:  do you like action movies, comic books and/or rooting for weird superheroes?  Then you?ll probably enjoy Hellboy.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>The 3 disc set, loaded with extras is well worth the extra money.  The extended scenes are blended in with the regular film, seemlessly added.  Some scenes I can see why they didn't make the cut.  Ususually for time constrants.  Still there are some extra scenes that are a treat.  They fill a small void that was in the theatrical version.  Fans can rejoice!  A sequel is coming.  The special effects are flawless, however I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the computer generated critters.  They were also kind of dull for monsters, but the action is aplenty.  Ron Pearlman is great as Hellboy.  He gives the character a human edge, and that helps greatly.  A good movie that could have been great, but still well worth the money.  Trade in the old PG13 version and buy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I've never read the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comics. I have nothing to base a comparison on as such, so I'll review this movie as a person who just happened to pick this one up not knowing what to expect. What a surprise! This is an action-packed, but tender-hearted romp through the life of one of the kindest, cockiest heroes of our time. Ron Perlman is perfect as Hellboy. He manages to show us just how gruff and mean Hellboy can be, but he exposes the heart that lies inside our hero as well.<br /><br /> The rest of the cast is superb. Selma Blair has the quiet, stand-offish stereotype down pat. Doug Evans(though you can't see him with all of that make-up) is witty and engaging as Abe Sapien. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's &quot;father.&quot;<br /><br /> The story takes you on a rollercoaster of a ride with the paranormal gang hunting down Rasputin(yes, that Rasputin). Along the way we are introduced to a freakish Nazi assassin, some hellhounds, and a dead guy named Ivan. What you get in the end is an action flick full of comedy and heart. If your kids can handle the violence of flicks like &quot;MIB&quot; and &quot;Tremors,&quot; I think they can handle this. The language isn't too severe. I don't remember any &quot;f&quot; bombs being dropped at all.<br /><br /> Guillermo del Toro takes the slick, cool-looking set design and story movement of &quot;Blade 2&quot; and tosses it into this movie minus all of the techno music. Characters are developed well, and the story moves at a quick pace.<br /><br /> Overall, a great film to watch, even if you don't know who Hellboy is. The DVD isn't that shabby either, what with being loaded to the nines with extras for film and comic buffs alike.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this flick to everyone who enjoys comedy, action and maybe even a little horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro pops up for his third American movie, and finally, he gets it right. Hellboy is a rip-roaring ride through a comic-book world on which del Toro could impose his own conventions without having to live up to a prequel (as with the mindless, utterly disappointing Blade II) or trying to make an action flick that requires suspense (as with the mindless, utterly confusing Mimic).<br /><br />In the 1940s, the Nazis, with the help of Grigory Rasputin (Karel Rodin. Also in Blade II)-- yes, that Grigory Rasputin-- try to open a portal to another dimension to summon what would be, had they been able to get the licensing, Lovecraft's Elder Gods. (I mean, come on. All those tentacles.) They fail, thanks to an American company of marines, but during the brief time the gate is open, something does come through-- an infant demon. With the marines is a paranormal advisor to Franklin Roosevelt, who takes the demon and raises it as his son. It grows up to be Hellboy (Ron Perlman, who will forever be remembered for his role in the TV series Beauty and the Beast more than anything), the crux of a division of the FBI that fights the paranormal, along with Abe Sapien, who might be better known as Fishboy (played by Doug Jones, but voiced by Frasier's David Hyde-Pierce), and a cadre of human agents. The newest of the humans is John Myers (played by newcomer Rupert Evans), and Myers and Hellboy go through the buddy-cop routine, but with a twist; part of Myers' mission is to bring pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) back into the fold. So it's a buddy-cop-love-triangle movie. With Cthulhu.<br /><br />The best part about the movie, really, is Perlman's wisecracking title character. The script puts him in some incredibly silly situations, but (and how much of this was actually scripted, how much was Perlman, we may never know) Perlman never lets Hellboy get through an absurd situation without remarking on its absurdity; for once, a truly intelligent action hero. It's about time. Add in a truly lovely nemesis in one of Rasputin's minions, the eerie Karl Kroenen (I'm sure the similarity to the name "Karl Rove" is a coincidence, but it makes the guy even eerier), a wisecracking corpse, a fish-man with a photographic memory, the potential a mini-Tristan-and-Isolde subplot (and this is really the movie's only failing; had they played that up, what fun they could have had), and John Hurt, and you've got two hours and change of out-and-out fun. Definitely worth seeing. ****</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Hellboy has some large shoes to fill and a lot to live up to considering that it seems like everyone and their grandmother is making movies about superheros these days.<br /><br />It is actually very good and definatly not one you want to take home and watch with your girlfriend guys(figured that out myself).  The acting is very good and Hellboy is protrayed very correctly as a loveable wisecracking demon who just can't seem to find his place in society.<br /><br />It is only the plot thin and after a certain point there is only so much I can tolerate(even for a superhero movie).<br /><br />So using me own private little rating system<br /><br />Superman<br /><br />Spiderman<br /><br />Hellboy<br /><br />Daredevil<br /><br />Hulk<br /><br />Overall-Just a fun action Friday night if you are into superhero movies you should get this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I went into this with no expectations. I was pretty impressed with the makeup and special effects the most. The acting, story, directing, and music were pretty good as well. All in all I would stack it up against "Spawn" and say it is better. And it is a close run to Daredevil's level. No it isn't quite the caliber of Spiderman or Blade, but still a very good movie worth seeing. If you are not sure about buying it then rent it first. I bought a copy on a hunch that there was more to it than the ads I saw. I was right. Ron Perlman does a fine job of portraying the comic book hero Hellboy. Ron played the beast in "Beauty and the Beast" TV series and as a hunchback in the movie "The Rose". He is no stranger to playing in unusual and demanding roles. This is pretty much a film for most the family. Certainly not suited for children less than eight years old. Some scenes with blood but not nearly as gory as Spawn or some others.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>I watched this movie again and maybe I'm wrong but I didn't notice any difference in the feature itself compared to the feature in the 2 disc "special edition". I thought it was supposed to have "never before seen extended,unrated version of the film". If it's unrated why does the blue screen come on prior to the movie that says PG-13???<br /><br />True the directors cut is loaded w/ more extras due, however I did notice that the "from the den" thing was gone from this set(see the special ed.). I compared the two in the store and that's the only thing I noticed was missing. I did like the slim DVD cases included in this set. It's also supposed to be "remastered in high def" and I'll say it does look great on DVD.<br /><br />I wish they would've released a 3 disc director's cut on Superbit instead, maybe that's coming?</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>mildly entertaining, but not in the same league as Spiderman and X-men.  Hellboy has some amusing quips as he battles the bad guys, but this is a superficial movie unlike the previously mentioned movies.  Although Hellboy gets knocked around, there is never any doubt he will prevail.  Also, not much original here as the title suggests this is just a mix of the X-Men and Men in Black.  Worth a rent, but not a buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>I went into HELLBOY uninitiated.  I hadn't read the comic but had seen some of the artwork.  Needless to say, I was intrigued by both MIKE MIGNOLA's cool artwork and the spiffy trailer.  The film turned out to be slightly dissapointing.  Not a bad flick, HELLBOY does have decent FX and some interesting characters, however the movie is lacking a flowing plot that takes away from what could've been a cool story.  RON PEARLMAN looks great, but the weak script gives him nothing but cheesy, cliched dialogue.  It's a shame to cast an enigmatic actor like him in the lead and give him so little to work with.  The rest of the characters work fairly the same.  Half fish-half man ABE SAPIEN is about the coolest thing in the film, but all but dissapears halfway through.  There were many elements without full explaination prevalent throughout the picture, which leads one to believe that the comic is much more in-depth than you can adapt to the big screen.  Director GUILLERMO DEL TORO has a great eye, but doesn't know how to bridge together a script with holes.  HELLBOY simply lacks the true engagement of a good yarn.  Which is too bad really, because everything about the production pointed to a hell of a good movie watching experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>HELLBOY [Ron Perlman, John Hurt, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans / Directed by Guillermo del Toro / 122 minutes / Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and frightening images]<br /><br />When I was a kid, my parents were adamant that we not read comic books. My cousins, who lived a couple of miles away, got to read them, but they couldn't go to any movie that wasn't rated G. My siblings and I got to see almost any movie. Looking back, I think we got the better deal. Our horizons were broadened through film far more than by reading comic books.<br /><br />When it comes to movies based on these books, I can see them only as movies, since I don't have much knowledge of the source material. I can't tell you how faithful "Hellboy" is to its comic book origins, but I can tell you it's an inventive, energetic movie.<br /><br />This dark comic fable begins near the end of World War II. The German Nazi high command, knowing it is about to lose the war, launches and effort to bring forth The Forces of Evil. The plan is intercepted by The Allies just in time by a commando squad. The one demon raised by the Nazis, Hellboy [Ron Perleman], is taken into custody. Raised in a secret location in the United States by the leader of the commandos, Hellboy learns to be a force for good. In the present day, all hell breaks loose, so to speak, and only Hellboy can save the planet from the forces of darkness.<br /><br />In translating to a movie, a comic book is no different from a literary masterpiece. To be successful, the movie has to succeed on its own terms. Having not read the original, be it `high' art or `low', shouldn't be an encumbrance to liking and understanding the film. "Hellboy' succeeds brilliantly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Something told me this movie could have been better. I enjoyed the movie, but I found most of it instantly forgettable, and I could barely follow what little plot there was, thinking that Hellboy ATE cats, instead of just being partial to them. And why didn't Liz want to come back to where everyone else was? And the Spear Of Destiny, most recently seen in Constantine, and subject of a lot of discussion as to whether it did kill Christ or not, appears, although briefly.<br /><br />However, I did love Ron Perlman - who shares the same birthday as me. I hadn't previously heard of him, but his dry sarcasm puts him in the same league as Bill Murray in my opinion. He was definitely cute as Hellboy, and the sarcasm was spot on. However, having seen him a photo of him without the Hellboy makeup on (which took four hours to apply), OMG, is it the same guy?! To prepare for his role, Ron read all the Hellboy comics and worked out three hours a day, five to seven days a week (varies). He also worked out while shooting, every day he had off from filming, he would workout. He also broke a rib while filming, after jumping onto a train that was coming towards him at about 45 mph. Very early on in the film's preproduction, the filmmakers considered putting Hellboy's giant stone hand on his left arm rather than the right, so as to grant the actor playing Hellboy the full use of his right hand. Ron Perlman turned out to be left-handed, so the filmmakers were able to preserve the Right Hand of Doom.<br /><br />There are no opening credits save the 3-D title, which is flown over several times by the camera before it pulls back to reveal the full title. During the closing credits there's a brief shot of Dr. Manning still trying to contact someone on his team and getting nothing in response. A shadow of a Sammael passes in the background as the scene fades back to credits.<br /><br />Both Mike Mignola and Guillermo del Toro have cameos in this. Mike, Hellboy's creator appears dressed as a knight in a crowd of costumed people menaced by Sammael. Guillermo is dressed as dragon in a crowd of costumed people menaced by Sammael.<br /><br />Extras are your usual for these movies. They include: commentary by director Guillermo del Toro and "Hellboy"-Creator Mike Mignola; commentary by Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans and Jeffrey Tambor; all-new DVD comics: eight branching DVD comics by Mike Mignola; "Hellboy: The Seeds of Creation" - a 2.5-hour documentary on the making of the film; "Right Hand of Doom: Set Visits" - behind-the-scenes branching feature; "From the Den" Hellboy recommends... Geraldn McBoing Boing animated shorts; feature-length storyboard track; video introduction by Selma Blair; four computer-generated animated scene breakdowns; five Board-a-Matics: side-by-side comparison of scenes with the animated storyboards; animatics; three deleted scenes with optional commentary by Guillermo del Toro; character bios written by the director; maquette 3-D character sculptures video gallery and poster explorations.<br /><br />I hope the sequel's better than the original, but more in storyline, and making Liz seem a little bit tougher more than anything else. The special effects are brilliant, my favourite is Liz's effects. Definitely worth watching though!<br /><br />If you're a sucker for finding easter eggs (not the chocolate ones), on Disc 2 go to the Board A Matics Screen. Put cursor on back, then press down.

Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. I generally like films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZ9E">X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)</a>, and superficially this movie was like those - the freaky superheros, the deranged villains. Visually, this is a strong movie and I can see del Toro's hand in creating a dark, visually arresting film.<br /><br />However, the plot and the acting were lousy and cliche. Unlike in a film like X-Men, with the subtle and charismatic Magneto, the villains in Hellboy were a clownish Nazi and, I kid you not, Rasputin the Russian monk. Hellboy himself, played by Ron Perlman, was hard to take seriously. He acts too much like he wants to be tough, but comes across as trying too hard.<br /><br />The story involved secret gates to hell which led to things that looked more like aliens than demons. There are also tons of lose threads - is it really likely that all of the hell hounds were located in one place? If the monster at the end was a "god," as Rasputin says, why was it so easy to kill?<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but just couldn't. At least the fish guy was pretty cool.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie has some funny scenes. The special effects are so so.

During WW2 a portal is opened by the Nazis and Hellboy escapes through it to be found and raised by the allies. 60 years later the time has come for Hellboy to serve the other side for the purpose for which he was designed. Quite what that purpose was I never really understood as the plot was somewhat confusing (not that it really mattered).<br /><br />Sadly although some of the CGI is very good, and there are a number of memorable sequences, there is just too much of it. Once you seen one CGI tentacled monster, another one just becomes a bit of a yawn. Its not without merit though. Ron perlman is a fine actor and delivers his lines with some style and when neccessary with a fine sense of comic timimg.<br /><br />Its certainly worth watching once, but I would be wary of buying it, as I don't think it will hold up to repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13.html">A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13</a><br/><p>Hellboy (Director's Cut)3 disc Set is One of my Favorite Movies<br /><br />I HAVE THIS 3 DiscSET Edition 'tis Perfect :)</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>I didn't like the movie honestly! of course it had some strong points. one of the most important prominences of this movie was the right and enoght imagination. they didn't bring us something unique at the price of sacrificing the impression of the film. It's a tradition in these days movies that they want to depict new versions of well known monsters and heroes and the consequences most of the times will be ridiculous and critical phenomenons! Fortunately I saw one of the best remakes of comic heroes in this movie! Hellboy was astonishingly brilliant and realistic. Visuals and CGs of this movie were excellent and looked realistic too. The only critical and unsophisticated character of the movie was "The Corpse"! the reason that I didn't like this movie was it's scenario. I think it's not dynamic enough. It's good and reasonable but it's not dynamic. there is not a jaw dropping action scene that makes you screen or jump out of your sit and there is not a hanging story that encourage you to watch it till the end. they tried to bring us both action and mystery. and they didn't succeed in both, specially the mystery! I can't give this movie more than 3 stars. but It's a 5 star DVD set!<br /><br />This DVDs design is a masterpiese! you'll get all you want, synchronized and real time! this is not the begining of new type of DVD production.

I admire them for the brilliant and revolutionary DVD release and I bought this movie only for the DVD options.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Looking at the HELLBOY  comics, it is hard to see anyone else than Ron Perlman in this role, and thats exactly what the commentary says. As I read it, and hear it, Ron was first and last Choice. The guy is such a master actor, yet oddly enough he is probably type-cast ( in terms of profile, not simply because his is one hell of an actor).<br />The touch that really works here is detail. The Director is, seemingly, a master of making the most of what he has, and doing it in amazing ways. The use of mirrors in one subteranean sequence is a master work.<br />Together with the creator of HELLBOY, and a team of skilled actors, and staff, the director evinces a world from the comics in a superb. Finally, it does boil down to the actors, and all else augments  what they do, as it should, and the end  result is a great potboiler.<br />Enjoy !!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>This was a thin concept that never made enough use of its star - Ron Pereleman.  An indestructible demon brought to Earth by Nazis during WWII (which overlapped with the "Occult Wars"), Hellboy was found by American soldiers and raised by a kindly professor (John Hurt) to fight evil.  Though he can clear tall buildings in a single bound and utter no more than "oh, crap", Perelman brings out a decidedly human side to the character.  HB has been working for our side - specifically the kind of super-secret organization that exists only in comic books or movie adaptations of them.  We first meet HB through the eyes of John Meyers - a young transfer from the FBI, who finds that his new job involves following HB around and making sure to have plenty of candy bars around for the right moment.  Though HB seems to have things under control, two problems nag him.  The first is his unrequited love for Liz (Selma Blair) an emotionally scarred fire-starter (she doesn't like the word "pyrokinetic").  His larger problems involve plans to complete the world-destroying plot that began with HB's arrival on Earth.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, mostly because Perlman brings surprising earnestness to his role of demon who likes kittens and can't get the girl.  The best thing about comic books is that they work as great ensemble pieces (a team of heroes, or a solitary hero working against a great villain).  Unfortunately, the script gives HB little support.  Rupert Evans as Myers can do little more than follow HB around, and keep him supplied with mounds of pancakes and gallons of chili, and there aren't enough scenes between Perlman and Blair or with his Hurt.  There's a scene midway in which Jeffrey Tambor, HB's reluctant boss, reminds him that theirs is a team effort - yet much of their back-up is anonymous.  Even the villain is generic - the kind of old-world sounding occult dude we had enough of in "Underworld".  The basic plot riffs on Lovecraft, but so did "Ghostbusters" 20 years ago.  In the end, HB becomes little more than Perlman v. CGI, a match that underrates the talents of both Perlman and his character.  HB is still nothing if not satisfying, though you never get past the sense it could have been so much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>My wife and I both enjoyed watching "Hellboy" on DVD, even though it was confusing in places and went on a bit too long.  Ron Perlman does a good job making Hellboy an interesting, even sympathetic, character, but there are too many balls in the air most of the time. The attempt to tie in every baddie of the 20th century, from Rasputin to the Nazis, seems forced.... and who built the huge, elaborate, gear-filled labyrinth under the mausoleum?  Lots of unanswered questions of this type. But if you're willing to go along for the ride, it's entertaining enough.  (We got an extra kick out of hearing David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapiens!)</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>This movie had good special FX,<br /><br />but got boring pretty fast!

Nice Lovecraft stuff sure, but additionally we get an interestingly compelling villain in the silent decaying assassin who dons various gas masks and wields knives in effective ninja style.  The demon Hellboy squirts through the portal before the allies close it and is raised by an old looking John Hurt.  Flash forward and the main antagonists are again at it in the 2000's, Hellboy in adolescence is joined by other paranormal fighters and must stop them.  The makeup on Perlman is pretty good and the CG effects aren't too bad.  It's not too engrossing but it was a pleasant time killer.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>The success of X-Men and Spider-Man has opened the door for a new wave a comic book adaptations. In the past, studios have played it safe and only green-lighted adaptations of mainstream comic books with large followings. However, this has changed as of late with Ghost World and now with Hellboy. Based on Mike Mignola's comic book of the same name, it has a dedicated cult following at best so it's a pleasant surprise to see a major studio take a big budget gamble with this title.<br /><br />Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as the cigar smoking, two-fisted action hero who eats Baby Ruth candy bars and loves cats. He does a great job of capturing Hellboy's sarcastic, wise-cracking nature. Perlman gets to utter cool one-liners and looks fantastic in his make-up (thanks to legendary make-up artist Rick Baker). Often, what makes it to the movie rarely resembles what was drawn in the comic book. Not the case here-Perlman IS Hellboy. With this role (and hopefully more sequels to come), he is destined to become the cult film icon of the new millennium (much like Bruce Campbell was in the `90s). Perlman has got the drop-dead cool action hero shtick down cold. With his hulking, imposing physique, he's Arnold Schwarzenegger with brains and irony.<br /><br />While the film has the requisite slam-bang action sequences, it is not dominated by them. The film is not driven by them but rather by the characters and the story. And this is because del Toro has strong source material to draw from: Mignola's comic book, in particular "Seed of Destruction," which chronicles Hellboy's origins. Both del Toro and Mignola's works are steeped in the gothic and horror genres, in particular the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. The author's influence is all over this movie as Hellboy trades blows with Cthulhu-inspired creatures that would make ol' Lovecraft proud.<br /><br />Fans of this movie are in for a real treat as the 2-DVD set is jam-packed with extras that will take hours to explore completely. Here are some of the highlights:<br /><br />The first disc features two audio commentaries. The first is by director Guillermo del Toro and Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. They talk about the nitty gritty details of the filmmaking process. Mignola explains the differences and similarities between the film and the comic book. This is a solid, informative track that is essential listening for Hellboy fans.<br /><br />There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary by del Toro. He mentions that two of them will appear on the extended cut DVD coming out later this year but in edited form so this is the only chance to view them in their entirety.<br /><br />The centerpiece of second disc is an exhaustive two-and-half hour documentary that can be watched in various segments or altogether. Del Toro provides a great description for Hellboy: "Imagine if The X-Files was investigated by an X-File." This is a detailed look at the making of the movie from the graphic novel to the movie itself with great attention paid to the make-up and visual effects.<br /><br />As exhaustive and complete as this 2-DVD set is, del Toro has promised an even more in-depth edition coming out later this year. It will feature an extended cut of the movie and new supplements (including a brand new audio commentary by del Toro) that will go even deeper into the filmmaking process (if that's possible!). In a classy move, Columbia even acknowledges this upcoming edition and includes a $5 off coupon with this current 2-DVD set. Studios rarely, if ever, warn consumers of double-dipping and del Toro has been very vocal in the press about it. Nice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Director Guillermo Del Toro (Mimic & Blade II) sets the stage for a new breed of heroes in the wildly entertaining comic book adventure "Hellboy". Since World War II, the secretive Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense exists to protect the world from the forces of darkness. When the mad wizard Rasputin (Karl Roden) plots to bring about the end of the world, the Bureau's most powerful agent, Hellboy (Ron Perlman), leads the fight to save humanity. "Hellboy" is an exciting action-packed adaptation of the popular Dark Horse Comics that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date. Its fast-paced story is quite engaging and its "colorful" characters are certainly interesting. This stylized comic book adventure features some witty humor, thrilling action sequences and cool eye-popping special effects. Ron Perlman's energetic performance of the title character is quite marvelous. The cast also includes Selma Blair, John Hurt, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor and Emmy Award winner David Hyde Pierce as the voice of aquatic Abe Sapien.<br /><br />"Hellboy" 2-Disc Special Edition is positively one of this year's best DVDs. The comic book adventure is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its picture quality is simply outstanding with excellent sharpness. Its dynamic Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is fantastic. The DVD also features a short introduction by director Guillermo del Toro, two separate audio commentaries by filmmakers and cast members, eight DVD comics by creator Mike Mignola, the informative "Hellboy: The Seeds of Creation" behind-the-scenes documentary, three deleted scenes with optional audio commentary track, in-depth animated storyboards, TV spots and theatrical trailers. The DVD menus look great. Overall, "Hellboy" contains a top-notch DVD presentation and scores a surprising "A-".</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this, I REALLY did...however it just fell flat with me.  It began with promise, and seamlessly picked up from the Nazi opening into the present, but not long after this the plot just got bogged down attempting to do too much.  For those Hellboy comic fans, I realize most of us really enjoyed it, but I prefer for my comic-turned-movie to be more coherent.  Just too much wasn't explained, and for even the most devout Hellboy fanatic, there was plenty that was just plain confusing.  I realize I get confused in my old age more often than not, but I ain't dead -- YET.<br /><br />The special effects were right on par with just about anything in film today.  In only a few places did I notice things that didn't look perfectly real.  The casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy can only be described as pure genius.  Nobody, but NOBODY could fill Hellboy's oversized shoes like Ron.  As though he were born to play this roll.  He brought a really great sense of humor to Hellboy that I was worried may not translate well on the big screen.<br /><br />I think all in all, the film wasn't bad, but in effort to please so many people, the filmmakers tried to tackle just too much in bringing this great character to life.  I am NOT saying that I know exactly HOW to do it right, because maybe, just maybe this is one comic character that in order to do justice, needs more than what a single 2-hour Hollywood film can pull off.  'Course I could be wrong, and I probably am to many, but this is just my take on the whole deal.  Looking back on it, I had a tremendous amount of fun watching the movie, but maybe I'm just too much of a purist and feel that more needed to be added in order to make it all right.  All things considered however, I AM glad somebody had the guts to at least give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Good story if you can get past the crappy beginning.  The FX are awesome in most scenes and then seem trivial and pathetic in others.  Don't get me wrong, overall I liked the movie.  A great comic adaptation, but the average viewier is going to be picking this thing apart.  Okay...you like comics??? RENT, do not buy this movie.  After you see what it offers, make your buying decision.  Personally, the dialogue and creaive charaters (except the main crappy villian) kept me interested enough to RENT a sequel.  It's sad that SO MUCH good movie was damaged by bits and pieces of bad...Still, worth the rental.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>At the end of WW2, Hitler attempts to open the gateway to Hell in order to bring back a weapon that will allow him to win the war. He is stopped by the Allies, but while the gate is open, a baby demon, Hellboy (Ron Perlman), comes through. 60 years later, Hellboy, who has been raised by the Allies and is now fighting on the side of good, must go up against the people who brought him to earth in the first place and stop them from bringing about the Apocalypse.<br /><br />"Hellboy" is a really great idea for a film that is let down by its poor execution. The idea of a demon fighting for good has so much potential, as does the idea of him having a pyrokinetic girlfriend (played by Selma Blair), and as with all Guillermo del Toro films, this one is also visually stunning, but once I got over the initial "wow" factor of the special effects, I soon realized that the plot is pretty thin, the characters are boring and the good ideas are underdeveloped (I thought it was criminal that Liz, the pyrokinetic girl, should really only use her powers about once in the whole film). The ending is also a major let-down. It just isn't big enough for what went before it and my father, who saw the film with me, actually said "that's it?!" when the credits started to roll.<br /><br />Although I haven't seen it yet, I have heard that "Hellboy 2" is an improvement on this film, which doesn't surprise me, considering the fact that, after a film this disappointing, the only way to go is up.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>There were some interesting scenes in this comic book adaptation by Mike Mignola, but ultimately, the hackneyed plot and confusing storyline outweighed the nifty artistic flourishes. The movie begins in WWII-era Russia, where the nazis open a gate to hell for just long enough to allow a baby demon to escape. An American scientist adopts him and raises him as a force for good. We then cut to present day, where a full grown Hellboy is teamed with other mutants to go get the bad boys at the behest of the government. But when the old nazis return from the dead to take their revenge, Hellboy has his most challenging adventure yet.<br /><br />  Some of the fight scenes are really cool, as are some of the character concepts (one of the villains is a clockwork assassin, for example). And Perlman's acting combined with his cool makeup job carry most of his scenes. There are also some funny moments that Perlman brings off exceptionally well, as when he jealously shadows Selma Blair when she has some intimate moments with a mutual acquaintance. Ultimately, thought, the action scenes get more dominant and less interesting, leading to a climax that is all about tying up loose ends.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Having read several of the comics on which this film is based, I had high hopes for the film.  Sadly, it didn't measure up to my expectations.  It was too derivative and depended too much on special effects-laden fight sequences.<p>Ron Perlman plays Hellboy as if he were Benjamin Grimm/The Thing from "The Fantastic Four": a mixture of bravado and pathos.  It's not surprising that the actor was able to exude some humanity under all that red makeup; he has made a career out of playing costumed characters ("Beauty and the Beast", "The Island of Dr. Moreau", "Star Trek: Nemesis").  <p>In addition to Hellboy the only other notable character was "Abe Sapien", physically performed by Doug Jones and voiced" by "Frasier's" David Hyde Pierce.  The character's screen time is limited but memorable.<p>Hopefully, in the sequel (and I'm sure that there will be one) there will be greater development of the Hellboy character, the most interesting comic hero in some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Hellboy is cliche after cliche, but with one heck of a sweet performance by Ron Perlman as Hellboy himself.  And there's the rub.  This really should have been a movie about Hellboy and his travails, sinking deep into his character--perhaps even as a narrator.  Instead, we get a pastiche of well-worn fan-boy story standards--Nazis, Lovecraftian "elder gods," Nostrodamus, etc.--tied together by unnecessary clutter.  And then, every so often, Perlman drops in with an endearing scene, and some great lines.<p>There's no great villain here.  The special effects are so-so (you can even see Perlman battling the wires on one jump), and the directing is workmanlike and not much more.

Who else would spend years on a tv show ensheathed in mounds of makeup and then turn around and do it again in HELLBOY?  Well, Ron, you've finally had a box office hit as the star!  Perlman is a good actor to hide in make-up; his voice is rich and tremolous; his eyes expressive, and his movements secure.  In HELLBOY, he uses these talents to bring us a delightfully flawed hero.  In films like this, I should think one could leave behind the concern over well developed characters and credibility.  It's a filmed comic book, for Pete's sake.  It has a lot of intense action scenes; some pretty cool monsters and a talented cast filling out their roles quite well.<br /><br />The CGI effects fit the movie perfectly; whether they set new trends of compare to others, that's really not the point.

After being foiled and dissapearing from sight, the machine did, however, let one thing through it's open mouth before being destoryed. A creature with bright red skin, a stubby tale, two little horns on it's forehead, and a right hand encrusted in stone. Along with the american soldiers professor broom took care of the infant named HELLBOY.<br /><br />Later on, we are shown that HELLBOY is grown up but barely aged twenty years. 60 years have passed and he's been riding the world of nightmare creatures ever since. That is, until, one day, Rasputin makes an appearence. But HELLBOY isn't as helpless as when he was an infant. He's got a load of new friends. John meyers, a promising second in comand agent. Elizabeth Shermen, A talented Pyro who can consume her whole body in flames and loves taking pictures. And, last but not least, Abraham Sapien, a Fish-like creature that lives to read four books at a time, eat rotten eggs and research more paranormal material.<br /><br />Together, they make a band of freak outcasts whose sole purpose is to rid the world of more people like them but who have turned to evil.<br /><br />Aside from fighting crime, Hellboy has a nagging goal to fit in. He files down his horns to 'fit in' and he also smokes big fat cigars and believes in christianity.<br /><br />But others are searching for him, waiting for him. Becuase their purpose involves hellboy. And it involves putting the demonic back into the demon.<br /><br />But, along the way, take advantage of seeing the spectacular special effects and the incredibly comic-like settings. It's easy to sympathize with hellboy because he's trying to become a man. And he has to learn it in the same way that all of us learned it . . .except for a few shady characters and unbelieveable circumstances. It truly is a Comic Book adaptation that shows you what it takes to be a man . . .even if you are from somewhere else.<br /><br />Final Verdict: He's big and red and full of wise guy.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Hellboy I just saw and enjoyed very much. It doesn't match up to the original source materials it was taken from --- one of the best written and drawn comics in the last 20 years --- but what film ever lives up to their books.<br /><br />For fans of the comics, this film is a must-see. There are some changes made to keep the film from becoming too much of a copy of the books. The changes didn't bother me too much. Some ideas were taken from other Hellboy stories, but you have to be a major fan of the work to notice them.<br /><br />For casual film fans, this film is a hit or miss. The film has a classic pulp, serial look and also doesn't try to make itself out to be something too serious, or life changing. This is supposed to be a fun film and I think it succeeds.<br /><br />The Hellboy comics are a gold mine for ideas. The graphic novel that this film was based on is not even the best, but good enough as an introductory film. If they give the go ahead for a sequel, I wish that Del Toro look hard at using the Wake the Devil graphic novel as a sequel: Vampires, reborn Greek Goddess, insane Nazi scientists, and more on Hellboy's origins and purpose.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>From visionary director Guillermo Del Toro ("Blade II", "Mimic", "The Devil's Backbone") comes "Hellboy", a supernatural action-adventure based on creator Mike Mignola's Dark Horse Comics series of the same name. "Hellboy" is one of the most original and most innovative comic-book films that's ever been put on the big screen since 2000's smash hit, "X-Men" and last year's mega-hit predecessor, "X2: X-Men United"! The direction of Guillermo Del Toro was outstanding! His best work since "Blade II"! The performances of Ron Perlman ("Blade II"), John Hurt ("Captain Corelli's Mandolin"), Selma Blair ("The Sweetest Thing"), Jeffrey Tambor ("Meet Joe Black"), Karel Roden ("15 Minutes"), and Rupert Evans, in his film debut, were nothing short of excellent!<p>The film focuses on the titled hero, Hellboy (Perlman), a tall, thickly muscled battler of evil, with skin as red as...well, the planet Mars. Years ago, at the end of World War II, Hellboy emerged as a baby demon and was saved from sinister forces by the benevolent Dr. Trevor "Broom" Bruttenholm (Hurt), who raised Hellboy to be a hero. Fast forward to the year 2004 (present day): Hellboy has spent the years in virtual lockdown at Dr. Broom's Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), where he's a prisoner of his mutant physique and -- on those occasions when he's allowed out -- his clandestine role as evil-basher. He still has his snapping tail, but he keeps his two thick horns shaved all the way down to his forehead; it's his way of trying to look ordinary -- and, more tellingly, of suppressing his demonic nature in order to do good. [In essence, Hellboy is the Hulk with rosier skin tones and the ability to talk -- at this point, a welcome quality in a magnum-lug superhero. He is also suited up for action in his leather trench coat and wields a colossal, stonelike right hand that might have been transplanted from the Thing in 'Fantastic Four'.]<p>In the midst of it all, Hellboy creates an unlikely family in Dr. Broom, the telepathic "Mer-Man" Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), and Liz Sherman (Blair), the woman Hellboy loves who can control and manipulate fire. Joining the team is young John Myers (Evans), who is recruited by Broom to become Hellboy's protector and caretaker. Hidden from society and the world that they love and protect (kind of relates to "X-Men"), Hellboy and the team must stop Rasputin (Roden), a sinister madman who seeks to reclaim Hellboy back to the Dark Side in order to use his powers to destroy mankind and bring Hell on Earth!<p>"Hellboy" has been directed, by Del Toro, with a colorfully kinetic visual imagination that almost never lets up. Del Toro, the former-art-house creep-meister turned megaplex fantasist, knows just how long to hold a shot of blood oozing through an ornate stone maze or ghouls flying through a ghostly museum so that we feel as if the sets or effects are serving the story rather than vice versa. He shows far more narrative finesse than was evident in such recent comic-book duds as "Daredevil", "The Hulk", and "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". Perlman, acting under all that makeup, gives a somewhat funny performance of gruff sympathy that, at moments comes close to wit. And Perlman is no stranger to donning creature makeup before, especially since he played a creature in 2002's "Star Trek: Nemesis" and starred on TV's 'Beauty and the Beast', alongside Linda Hamilton.<p>The Hellboy mythology is sprinkled with references to the Nazis, Rasputin, and other sinister forces of old. The film's most colorful bad guy is Kroenen, a former occult leader of the Third Reich who wears a metal plate on top of his disfigured face and whirls twin blades around with a zesty slash of finesse. He's supposed to be a spirit of malevolence ricocheting through the ages, but I just looked at him and thought, "It's Darth Vader meets Wolverine (with less personality than either one of them)".<p>In conclusion, "Hellboy" has it all: Action, suspense, a talented all-star cast, a great storyline, and explosive special effects that six-time Academy Award winner Rick Baker ("Star Wars: A New Hope", "Men in Black", Dr. Seuss' "How the Grinch Stole Christmas") and his acclaimed Cinovation Studios can provide us with! "Hellboy" is, without a doubt, a definite DVD must-have when it's released!</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>I came to this movie having no idea of the comic book character and damn if it wasn't a great movie with a lot emotional impact.  Yeah, it's a movie about a demon who fights against other demonic beings, but at its heart it is also a story of the love between a father and son.  Ron Perlman as Hellboy is simply fantastic.  I've been a fan of Mr. Perlman since his days on "Beauty and the Beast."  I see a lot of the emotion he showed as Vincent in this movie.  All of the actors are great with Selma Blair and John Hurt chief among them. Hellboy is not your usual summer movie fare.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a fun movie.  I love the way the movie looks and the attitude it takes towards its characters.  The actors give the characters just enough depth to give them a sense of being a part of a real world and yet they have enough swagger and attitude so we know it is a cartoon come to life.  Guillermo Del Toro has to be thanked for pulling this off so well.<br /><br />Ron Perlman does a superb job in realizing Hellboy.  I mean, come on!  How many actors could put on a suit that strange looking and still bring off a character that you understand with feelings and how he relates to other people?  Too bad it will be dismissed in the serious crowds because it is a cartoon character - this is a fine acting job.<br /><br />Selma Blair is touching as the firestarter who is terrified of a power she hasn't yet learned to control.  She also has mixed feelings towards Hellboy who is completely possessed by her.  It is a good match with the right mix of troubles for a movie.<br /><br />Jeffrey Tambor also adds so much to the movie with some very nice touches as Tom Manning.  His character both covers for Hellboy and views him as a bit of a problem.  Towards the end of the movie there are some nice moments as the two come to a better understanding.<br /><br />Rupert Evans is just fine as John Meyers who is the reluctant new person in charge of taking care of Hellboy.  Fresh from Quantico it is his first assignment and his youth and inexperience show, as does his good heart.<br /><br />And what can one say about John Hurt?  He is fabulous as Hellboy's "father".  Kevin Trainor is the younger version of Trevor Bruttenholm and his brief but energetic performance sets a great foundation for all that follows.<br /><br />Doug Jones provides the physical characterization of Abe Sapien.  Abe's voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce.  Abe is a good character who adds quite a bit to the story, but must have been a monster of a role to enact.  I can't imagine the difficulty of acting in that costume.<br /><br />What is a movie without villains?  This one has three very sinister ones.  Of course, their being Nazis makes them that much more evil.  Karel Roden as Grigori isn't really a Nazi, but was working with them at the beginning of the movie.  He is the head villain.  He has a girlfriend who is gorgeously played by Biddy Hodsen.  Ladislav Beran makes Kroenen the creepiest thing in the movie.  The bad guys and gals really add the spice to this movie.<br /><br />Don't expect high art here, but do expect surprisingly effective characterizations and a quality of acting far above most movies based on comic book characters.<br /><br />The extras on this disk include two commentaries that do add to your appreciation of the film and the ability to visit the sets at various points while watching the film.  All pretty cool stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>After crafting an unappreciated classic with Blade 2, director Guillermo del Toro brings Mike Mignola's classic Dark Horse Comics character to life in this stunning and superbly crafted film.  In a last ditch effort to turn the tide of World War II, a Nazi experiment to bring forth a creature of destruction results in the coming of a horned, red skinned creature, aptly called Hellboy (Ron Perlman, perfectly cast), who over the years is raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt) and works for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, battling otherworldly creatures alongside his amphibious partner Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by Fraiser's David Hyde Pierce) while nursing a love for the pyrotechnical Liz (Selma Blair).  del Toro and his crew have really crafted something special here, paying wonderful homage to Mignola's source material while del Toro's screenplay adds another layer of development to the characters, taking the relationships between Hellboy, Broom, and Liz to never before imagined heights.  Perlman, mostly known for his role on TV's Beauty & the Beast, is perfect is Hellboy, and I can't imagine anyone else whether it be Nicolas Cage or Vin Diesel (both of whom were rumored to have attachments to the film in early development) to play the hero.  It's not perfect, and not up there with the original Batman, Blade, or X2: X-Men United; but Hellboy is without a doubt one of the most brilliantly conceived visual feasts adapted from a comic book of all time, and fans of Hellboy old and new will find plenty to admire with this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Hellboy has to be one of the best experiences I've had at the movies. It's exciting, funny and is the best movie based on a comic since X-Men 2. For a move that is only about an hour and 50 minutes, Guillermo del Toro (Mimic, Blade 2), throws a lot at you in just one movie. The beginning throws so much at you in like 5 minutes that you feel like you just watched a whole movie when it didn't really even start yet. Guillermo del Toro is a director that's great with giving the viewer interesting and scary creatures in all his movies. He knows how to give you the feeling that what your looking at is real. It's too bad that George Lucas isn't letting anyone else direct the prequels because Guillermo del Toro would probably make one awesome StarWars movie. When you see his name there as director you know you're in for a ride. <p>  Anyway Hellboy is about a demon child who is released from a portal in the early 1900's. Nazi's opened the portal trying to bring hell on earth. A scientist finds the demon child and raises him to be good and to fight evil. The child grows up to be Hellboy (Ron Perlman of Blade 2 and City of the Lost Children), a big red demon with broken off horns and an attitude. He has a soft spot however and that soft spot is what keeps him good. He's also in love with a girl who can produce fire (Selma Blair. The movie spends a little too much time with him being jealous that she might have feelings for the new guy on the team though. However Hellboy being jealous is pretty funny and makes for some entertaining scenes so it still works. Ron Perlman is fantastic as him. He's witty, scary and loveable all in one. The movie should not only be seen for the action, cool creatures and del Toro's direction but for Perlman's performance as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Based on the comics created by Mike Mignola and directed by fan and filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro. The movie begins with Hellboy's origins of how he was brought to earth in the 1940's via a thwarted Nazi occult experiment. He is thus raised as a warrior for good in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.  The B.P.R.D. also sports an amphibious telepath (Abe) and a pyrokinetic (Liz). Together they must take down the very same villains that brought Hellboy to Earth. Led by Rasputin, they seek to bring back the evil god Ogdru Jahad and the end of the world!<br /><br />Hellboy is great fun. Fans of the comics will love this adaptation as well! There's a new hero in town and he's BIG and RED!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Stunning picture and sound. My 50' HD plasma was filled with great darks and colors! A must own Blu Ray. Many of the special features from the 3 disc director's cut are carried over. Unfortunately the cast commentary is gone. FINAL THOUGHTS: It would be a BIG RED mistake not to upgrade! UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Based on the works of Mike Mignola, "Hellboy," written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, is a better-than-average comic book adaptation that boasts a refreshing sense of humor amid all the customary action sequences and first-rate special effects. The story begins in 1944, near the end of World War II, with the Nazis attempting to open a portal between earth and a hell-like dimension where seven evil deities have been lying in wait for just such an opportunity to come in and take over the world.  One creature from the other side makes it through before the Nazis` scheme is thwarted, a young "boy" who is adopted by an American expert in the paranormal and groomed to become a superhero who can do battle with all the supernatural creatures who apparently exist in an abundance undreamed of by the vast majority of the human race.<br /><br />The makers of the film have wisely chosen to keep Hellboy life-sized and believable in both his physical and psychological dimensions.  Despite his red skin, stone right hand and ability to leap from rooftop to rooftop with gravity-defying ease, Hellboy is really just an Average Joe-type, with a bit of an ego, a sardonic sense of humor, a strong sense of loyalty, and a really good heart.  Heck, he even has problems in the romance department not much different from what all the rest of us go through at one time or another in our lives.<br /><br />The movie is overlong and the screenplay probably includes one or two monsters more than it needs to in order to get the job done, but Ron Perlman, even under all the heavy makeup, makes Hellboy a three-dimensional, sympathetic character, while John Hurt brings warmth and authority to the role of Professor Bruttenholm, the "father figure" who raises him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Big. Red. Boasts a pair of char-blackened horns growing up from his skull, surmounted by the eternally burning Crown of the Apocalypse. For millennia his coming has been foretold by Prophets and dreaded by visionaries. He is called Anung un Rama, "The Beast of the Apocalypse", bearer of Right Hand of Doom and opener of the Gate between Hell and Earth.<br /><br />He's also known as Hellboy, and he has a soft spot for Baby Ruth bars, stogies, and cats. Oh, and did I mention he's the Good Guy?<br /><br />Christened "Hellboy" by the Allied dogfaces who rescued him from the ruins of the Nazi occult Project Ragnarok, this Demon princeling and child of the Pit is now in the care of the Bureau of Paranormal Research & Defense---though as Hero or Prisoner it's not quite certain---to track down the forces of Evil and Darkness, and whack it upside the head. Hard.<br /><br />Fans of the graphic novel wondered whether Del Toro, who had directed "The Devil's Backbone" and "Blade 2", could manage to conjure the magic of Mike Mignola's masterwork---replete with elaborate chiaroscuro illustrations and obscure historical allusions and references (the Thule Society, Grigory Rasputin, the slumbering beasts culled straight from the Lovecraft mythos)---into a studio-produced feature film---and not drown the flick in hours of exposition?<br /><br />Del Toro pulled it off brilliantly, working ferociously with Director of Photography Guillermo Navarro to bring Mignola's high style and potent brew of lumbering star-spawned monsters, diabolical Nazis, undead assassins, grave-bound liches, international plots, and brutal secret societies up on the big screen.<br /><br />Del Toro plunges us down onto a rain-spattered storm-besieged Scottish island in 1944. The Third Reich is collapsing under the relentless Allied onslaught in the West and the Soviet steamroller in the East. Desperate, Hitler's Thule Society dispatched former Russian "Mad Monk" Grigory Rasputin (Karel Roden, channeling the crazed ascetic) to rip open a portal into another dimension, unleashing the slumbering eldritch beasts of the Ogdru-Jahad---slavering demons---upon the Allies.<br /><br />American G.I.s break up the party, but too late---something slips through: a fire-engine red little Imp with a taste for Baby Ruth bars. The dogfaces name him "Hellboy".<br /><br />From there we cut to the present, where Hellboy (Ron Perelman, who just owns the movie) is all growed up into a full-fledged Demon, doing Hellboy things: pumping iron, surrounded by legions of his beloved cats, smoking a stogie, eating pancakes.<br /><br />Oh, and he files his horns down. To "fit in".<br /><br />The young Professor "Broom" Bruttenholm (the flawless John Hurt), who discovered Hellboy, has also aged---but Hellboy clocks his birthdays according to Hell's timetable. Bruttenholm is pushing 85 and looking for a successor.<br /><br />The candidate: young FBI Agent John Myers (Rupert Evans, doing a good job of looking nervous), who serves Hellboy his pancakes and rides with him and telepathic Fish-pal Abe Sapien (body by Doug Jones, voice by David Hyde Pierce, fondness for raw eggs) on a five-alarm demon-stomp at the Museum of Natural History.<br /><br />The rest of the flick is a wild, sleekly visual, hyper-kinetic Devil's hayride of Cool, High Style, and demon-on-demon action. It's not a big surprise when Hellboy's battle royale with "Hound of the Resurrection" Sammael leads the BPRD to grimmer stuff: a global plot headed up by sinister plotters thought long dead: Rasputin, his yummy Teutonic squeeze Ilsa (Biddy Hodson channeling Eva Braun), and undead Nazi killer Karl Ruprect Kroenen (Ladislav Beran, who steals every scene he wheezes, slices, and dices through), who makes up in razor-bladed carnage what he lacks in conversation.<br /><br />"Hellboy" is 360 degrees of cool. Stop the tape a minute: let's rewind to that scene on the remote Scottish island. Look at the windswept, ghoul-haunted ruins; check out Rasputin's jerry-rigged Hand of Doom, ringed with crispy globules chittering and crackling with electricity; marvel at the waves of darkness as the nervous G.I.'s scramble across the slick black rock, while white-suited insect-eyed Nazi scientists gear up the machinery to tear Hell wide open---and glance nervously into the hungry shadows.<br /><br />Note the way that krieg light slips into the well between the worlds, spins in a graceful balletic arc toward the slumbering crystallized Elder Gods, and bumps against it, startling open a drowsy demon eye. Nice. Del Toro is also consummately in control of his sound, moving instantly from pandemonium to dead silence.<br /><br />Guillermo keeps an iron hand on his little railroad to the Apocalypse: the direction is tight, neat, furious, fast-paced. The acting is all superior: Ron Perelman lives and breathes Hellboy. Jeff Tambor maintains deniability and smokes his stogie like a champ as the BPRD chieftain and uber-honcho.<br /><br />I've never liked Selma Blair: I find her google-eyes and over-large hands more Abe Sapien than sex-kitten, and she comes across as thoroughly disjointed and completely messed up. Given that her character is equally psycho, she works.Karel Roden growls and snarls and menaces effectively; Kroenen rocks the world without saying a word.<br /><br />But the real star of the show is Guillermo Navarro's flawless cinematography and Del Toro's tight directorial hand. Grab the Director's cut of the DVD: not only is it stuffed with extras you'd need a demon's lifetime to appreciate, but the extra footage and transfer add considerably to the final cut. Time to raise some Hell.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Hellboy' tells the story of a demonic looking character that is brought to this dimension when the villain Rasputin (yes, that Rasputin from Russia) attempts to open a portal to revive the Gods of Chaos. Ron Perlman takes up the role of Hellboy and dons the horns, tale, lots of red makeup, a mean rock solid right arm, and a great wit. Unfortunately, Perlman's character is one of the few things done &quot;just right&quot; in this movie.<br /><br /> I'm not familiar with the comic book, but I'm told this movie adaptation is fairly faithful to it. It certainly has the feel of a movie adapted from the comics. Hellboy's appearance is straight of a comic (and it is kind of funny how there is a Hellboy comic book that is referenced a few times in the movie). A few of the action scenes have the over the top style action (big swings, bodies flying from impact, etc.) found in the pages of a comic. So, it at least has the feel right.<br /><br /> Where the movie suffers is that it falls just between either being too long or not long enough. There are four or five key characters, and outside of Hellboy, most of them were not developed well enough. Some back story is given on each in the way of exposition or flashback, but the emotional or mental bagage the characters carry is never really fleshed out or resolved. One gets the feeling that Rupert Evans' character, John Myers, should have had a bigger role. All we know is that he is to be Hellboy's new guardian of sorts, but we don't really get to know him. Similar remarks could be made about some of the other characters. Perhaps by making the moview longer, we could have gotten to know the characters better. Or, if some of the characters had been excised from the film, the rest would have had a more substantial role to play.<br /><br /> Hellboy and his companions are frequently employed to hunt down monsters from gothic lore and the occult. They work for the Bureau of Paranormal Investigations (or something like that). Besides Rasputin, none of the monsters or figures they go after in this film are familiar to the casual viewer. The movie probably would have been better served by using better known villains, or by developing the story behind the villains and what they were trying to accomplish a little better. For instance, Rasputin has a blonde femme fatale henchman, er henchwoman. It is never quite clear what role she serves.<br /><br /> Comic book fans should be pleased with this movie. Those that aren't as familiar with comics or the occult (which figures prominently in this 'Men in Black,' 'Ghostbusters,' 'Van Helsing' style movie) probably won't enjoy it much. Its good for a viewing or two, and the DVD is loaded with special features on two discs. I'd give it a limited recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>First things first, let me say "Welcome to the material plane oh Great Red One!" The '04 cinematic release of `Hellboy' definitely brought new meaning and dimension (dimension, get it?) to the superhero film genre and the never ending battle between Good and Evil.<br /><br />The storyline contains all the elements the astute comic book fan or student of the esoteric and arcane would expect; nightmarish locations and stormy nights, magical incantations and prophetic utterances of impending doom, animated corpses and demonic entities, portals to the Otherworld and of course plenty of Nazis. Add to the mix the mad monk Rasputin, the awakening ot the Lovecraftian "Seven Gods of Chaos" and you've got a Cosmic confrontation on your hands that only the likes of Hellboy can withstand.<br /><br />This movie has it all, well developed storyline, superb special effects with an entertaining mixture of action sequences and witty, intelligent dialogue delivering a lot of quotable dialogue. Ron Perlman is absolutely perfect as Hellboy and under the magnificent direction of Guillermo del Toro it was truly a match made in Heaven (sorry, couldn't resist)!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Ron Perlman is Hellboy and makes the movie worthwhile even if it wasn't any good. But have no fear because the movie is really good. No other actor I can think of is more perfect for this part and I was happy to finally see him get a starring role in a movie, rather than the side-kick or bad-guy part of norm. His eyes, voice, and sarcastic personality really shine through all those layers of awesome make-up. Rick Baker did the make-up effects and that alone promises greatness in that department. The love story between Hellboy and Liz was funny and sweet, not sappy like the one in Spiderman. Everyone cast seemed like they fit the part, especially John Hurt (the mentor) and Liz (Selma Blair). The special effects for the most part are great, with only a few scenes standing out as just average (the underwater egg hunt & the blue fire). All in all, I had a blast with the action scenes and remained interested in the plot, which was fresh and new for this type of movie. Not being one who has read the comics, I still haven't figured out all of the plot or who some of the bad characters were suppose to be. But since I plan on seeing it again real soon, I will be sure to pay more attention to the story rather than just the overwhelming visuals. This is easily one of the better Super-Hero films of the last few years! "Second Date...No Tongue."-Hellboy</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Hellboy: 10 out of 10: Hellboy is one of the three best comic book adaptations of the last ten years. Now considering the recent spate of mediocre comic book adaptations (as of 2004) this is a bit like winning a beauty contest at a fat farm. Hellboy is simply head and shoulders above the rest.<br /><br />It is on par with the recent Spiderman movies (Hellboy sports a better hero and better CGI effects while Spiderman takes the nod in the love interest and villains categories) much better than the X-men films and simply puts other comic book adaptations to shame (League of Extraordinary Gentleman should be particularly embarrassed)<br /><br />Hellboy starts with a rip-off of one of the last scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark and introduces horrible clich&eacute;d villains such as Nazi babe and Rasputin. Yet the scene works somehow. Director Guillermo del Toro nails a comic book style to the direction that keeps the action and humor going during the most implausible circumstances. Kudos is also in order for the special effects, both make-up (which is spot on) and CGI.<br /><br />In general I dislike CGI effects compared to models but they really do shine here. Many a big-budget Hollywood film has come out recently with horrible special effects that stick out despite 50 million plus budgets. Hellboy's effects are simply seamless where one forgets that entire characters and locations are digitally generated.<br /><br />The acting is also seamless with lead Ron Perlman giving a scene stealing cigar chomping performance that rivals Daniel Day Lewis's turn in Gangs of New York and Jeffrey Tambor turning a stock clich&eacute; (obstructionist bureaucrat who wants to shut everything down) into a humanistic sympathetic character. (This is an example of very smart writing which permeates the film that makes even the clich&eacute;d characters into three-dimensional figures.)<br /><br />Although all is not perfect (In addition to Nazi Chick and Rasputin we also have a Clock/Sand Nazi and a Space Cthulhu as an improbable villains); Hellboy is better than an action movie should be, much better than a comic book adaptation ought to be, and immeasurable better than a movie called Hellboy deserves to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>In the search for wonder weapons, the Nazis allowed themselves to listen to a certain man by the name of Rasputin. Many people would know him as "the mad monk" or other terms, but the Nazis only saw a way t make a quick buck. I wish the movie could have brought about how he survived his fall better, how the seven didn't just have the power but there was also a certain witch named Baba Yaga that had quite the way with this world, but movies can only do so much. This movie did quite a bit, too, taking many of the things fromt he first ansd second graphic novel and giving them to an audience that wants. Mignola said that the answers he gave here made him feel a little bad, too, so the graphic novel readers were rewarded by getting explanations they may have otherwise found themselves without. In my world, that's a win-win on both fronts.<br /><br />As far as the movie fgoes, it had a little bit of everything. There were the fables that mixed with the Hellboy flavor, introducing Nazis that readers would recognize but adding them with a twist. Seeing these things move on the screen was beautiful, too, because i really didn't expect so much from Hellboy going into the primetime. Still, add a great director, imput from the writer, and Ron P. (the only person i can see being Hellboy) and you have yourself a set-up. Then add in other things like the CGi that blended in beautifully, Chtulu-spawned beasts that were shout outs by both director and writer, and you have yourself a great story. It has pieces that make it a little bit of eveything, too, from the coedy styling of a joke here or a beast there and you have youself something that shines on the screen.<br />In the beginning I had my reservations, too, but the end product made me a happy camper.<br /><br />For fans of the series, this is a great thing. From people who do not know anything about the series, it is something grerat with a title that echoes the Pulp comic days of yore. There are all sorts of things that are good to have here, garnering high priase from someone that has followed ( and reviewed) almost everything that has Hellboy in its pages. And I loved what was made here, much to my surprise.<br />Heavily recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>Well it isn't better than spider man that's for sure, but its still good fun. Hellboy never caught by immediate attention when it first came out. I didn't watch the movie until the sequel was released on DVD. Now was the movie worth watching when it first came out in theaters...Well...Yeah, this is a very different and unique comic book adaptation. The visual effects are stupendous; and the action is non stop.<br /><br />The movie explains briefly the origins of Hellboy. It all begins in 1944 with Professor Trevor Bruttenholm and a group of soldiers. They are sent out to Scotland to stop German Nazis from opening a portal to another world. In the process of course something comes out from the other world, and obviously that is our protagonist Hellboy.  Later in 2004,someone has returned to open the portal and unleash hell...how nice right?<br /><br />I give credit to the movie for being very original and fresh. The effects are superb through the majority of the film. Guillermo Del Torro has managed to adapt a very clever movie that gives you laughs, drama, horror, and an understanding of a hero who has been out casted from the real world. This is well worth owning, especially on the 3 disc directors cut, which contains hundreds of special features and runs 10 min longer than the theatrical cut.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Working with a near perfect balance of action, humor and charm, the first of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F7MSFW">Hellboy</a> series to reach the big screen is a highly entertaining flick. While Ron Perlamn's effective performance as the gruff but warm hearted red monster centers the film, he is surrounded by a phalanx of supporting actors that give "Hellboy" its broadened success.<br /><br />In particular, John Hurt as Hellboy's father figure caretaker, Dr Bloom, exudes a strong intelligence and sense of purpose to avoid his character being a scientist cardboard cutout. Rupert Evans plays a befuddles new handler, newly exposed to the top-secret paranormal agency that Hellboy dwells in. Add some angry Nazis and one p-o'd rasputin who want to destroy the world, and you have a firecracker of a fun film.<br /><br />Written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, the script pops at all the right moments all while adding character touches. The action sequences are a rollercoaster of thrill and scare (and the box of kittens is a hoot), along with a terrific visual sense. Even Jeffrey Tambor's sourpuss gets a good lesson in accepting the unusual before the film ends. For fans of the resurgent comic book movie genre, "Hellboy" hits all the right notes.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>I loved this movie; what a complete and total surprise!<br /><br />I am a comic book fan of the highest order: I still get them every Wednesday...I have over 13,000...I defend the artform to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />But somehow, I never "got into" Hellboy." I knew it was highly regarded. The visuals appeared interesting. But I never took the dive.<br /><br />I bought the DVD, never watched it. I bought the "Special Edition"; never watched it. I have that disease. Gotta get them just in case they sell out and you can find them anymore...y'know?<br /><br />I just got my Blu-Ray player, and for some strange reason, I picked up "Hellboy" in my initial batch of a dozen discs.<br /><br />It ended up being the first movie I put in my player. It sort of "called" to me.<br /><br />Wow. I was hooked from the opening sequence to the bold credits. And not just because the images were razor-sharp and the sound was goose-bump-making perfect.<br /><br />It's because Hellboy, and his dad, and the fish guy, and Jeffrey Tambor and freakin' Guillermo Del Toro all conspired to suck me into this world that I bought hook, line and giant rocky right hand.<br /><br />The action is outstanding, the humor delicious, the special effects supreme. The plot is a tad muddled, but you won't care.<br /><br />The characterizations...the dialogue...just sparkles. I was reminded of those old-fashioned movies...ones where what the characters were saying is just as important as what they are doing.<br /><br />Yes, even if that character is a big, red demon-like dude who saws off his horns.<br /><br />Not only can't I wait to watch this again, but now I'm going to make every effort to check out the sequel in a few weeks, and see it on the REALLY big screen...<br /><br />Man...I STILL can't get over how much I dug this film...!</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I really did not know what to expect when I sat down to watch Hellboy.  While there have been some excellent movies based on comic books, I had never even heard of Hellboy until recently, and did not have high hope.  But the trailer for Hellboy 2 was so entertaining, that I figured I needed to give Hellboy a try.<br /><br />What a surprise!  Hellboy is a light-hearted action-horror film (there's a new genre for you!).  It is filled with action and suspense, yet it is also filled with comedy and charm.  This movie does not try to take itself too seriously.  My guess is that it comes pretty close to the comic books, and does not try to be "more".<br /><br />Ron Perlman truly shines as Hellboy, bright red skin, horns, and all. The tender scenes between Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) (fire-starter and love interest) are sweet and funny.  Doug Evans is very engaging as Abe Sapien, Hellboy's friend and partner. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's "father."  Another standout is Jeffery Tambor as Hellboy's boss. He is a real jerk throughout most of the film, and you just plain don't like him.  But near the end, the "Thank You" scene between these two actors is dead-pan perfection.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie about good verses evil, where the (unlikely) superhero makes a difficult choice, and still gets the girl in the end.  As I said before, I had no idea what to expect, and wasn't even sure that I would like it.  But, there is something quite appealing and charming about this film; it almost sneaks up on you.  I highly recommend that you give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IPLCBZ3LIGX.html">A29IPLCBZ3LIGX</a><br/><p>This is an amazing transfer to BD.  Far superior to the dvd.  Could've wished for more extras, but overall, a pleasure to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Comic book movies is another trend in Hollywood that's slowly starting to die out. Like horror movie remakes and ultra-gory new ones to the CGI-animated ones, Hollywood always goes to what's the next big thing. Granted there is the occasional oddball that completely gets a cult following but you mainly see a trend and familiarity. When X-Men became a surprise hit, everything got bought up. Turns out though that Hellboy was actually a pet project for years by Guillermo del Toro, director of films like Blade II and the recent Pan's Labyrinth. Upon watching the film, you get the feeling that it's not outright terrible like Daredevil, it's just you were almost hoping it'd be a tad better.<br /><br />In 1944, Nazis in Germany have been interested in the Occult and they're planning on bring forth a creature from a portal that can turn the Earth into an apocalyptic wasteland. They're stopped in time but something gets through: a small devil-like red creature with horns, a tail and a big right arm. He grows up, named Hellboy, with the help of Dr. Bloom and his friend Abe Sapien, a fish/humanoid-like creature. He harbors a love for his former flame Liz which gets threatened when the FBI sends over an agent named Myers to watch over him. Of course it isn't helped that Rasputin and 2 others want to again bring forth the Apocalypse.<br /><br />It's strange that I actually haven't found an outright terrible comic book movie(oops, almost missed Batman and Robin, sorry) but even lambasted ones like Daredevil, Hulk or Fantastic Four had some likability. For all their faults, whether it's casting the main lead(Daredevil) to unnecessary scenes(Hulk) to just general okayness(Fantastic Four), they were at least films that I didn't felt like I demanded my money back. Hellboy is similar in that it's actually a pretty solid comic book film. It feels like a comic book film and not just a world that so happens to have superheroes. Ultimately the big problem with the film is that it doesn't seem to go beyond its limitations. Sure it's got creatures and such but the film doesn't really reach the heights of the best of previous comic book movies it just sits there.<br /><br />Where the film does excel as well is in its casting in particular Ron Perlman who always tends to play those brash mouthy types. Well it fits with Hellboy. Unlike brooder Batman or squeaky clean Superman, Hellboy smokes cigars and has a very sarcastic attitude. Everyone else is fine but either Selma Blair was the wrong choice for Liz or she just wasn't given enough to do. Points for casting David Hyde Pierce has the voice for nerdy Abe though. The only thing that is slightly disappointing is Rasputin as a villain is just not as threatening as he should be.<br /><br />Unlike some directors who prefer to leave film in that mystery place where making a film shouldn't be explained and dissected but experienced, del Toro loves DVD apparently so the disc is quite packed with no less than 3 commentaries, a documentary longer than the movie as well as branching options and a neat but kind of pointless booklet included. I always find it fascinating to watch how enough special features can change your appreciation of a movie and you get a better understanding of Hellboy when you watch them.<br /><br />I actually blind-bought Hellboy so who knows how you'll react to it but I didn't feel I wasted my money, which is quite the rarity lately. It may not be Superman or X-Men 2 but at least it's an entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.<br /><br />This is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend, possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of Ron Perlman and it was great to see him in a leading role, even though he's covered in makeup. Perlman is the best thing in this movie; he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering one-liners with ease and to perfection, battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets, and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.<br /><br />And the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive, but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. Rick Baker should be praised for his work in this, it's amazing.<br /><br />Doug Jones is awesome as the body of Abe Sapien. His movements are truly beautiful. And David Hyde Pierce as the voice is perfect. Abe is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than Hellboy's.<br /><br />John Hurt is great in this, as is Jeffrey Tambor. Everyone in this does a great job. But Perlman's performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.<br /><br />If you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.<br /><br />Hellboy isn't perfect, I would have changed some things, but I had fun watching it and in the end, especially for a movie of this type, I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now, after seeing it again, than I did when walking out of the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A very pleasant surprise, Hellboy, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a devil that crossed over from hell through an experiment conducted during WWII, and the life he lives hunting down monsters and protecting mankind!<br /><br />I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant and entertaining movie.<br /><br />In short, the acting is above average, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is a pretty good one.<br /><br />There are slight hints of the X-Files, and strong/obvious elements of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Van Helsing and the X-Men, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/sci fi type of category.<br /><br />On the negative side can we not find something more original than the USUAL German/Nazi "bad guy" clich&eacute;, together with the USUAL crazy/deranged/dangerous Russian "boogieman" leading to the USUAL need to be rescued by the benevolent Americans?  Is that too much to ask?<br /><br />Moreover, Selma Blair playing "Liz" was not that wonderful.  The "misfit who doesn't belong" has way too many similarities with characters from the X-Men.<br /><br />In addition, it's too bad "Ilsa" had such a small role in the film; seems like she could be a rising star...<br /><br />In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, Hellboy will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  A movie definitely worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Hellboy...what a great title for a film, anyway this is one of the best (if not the best) comic book translations to film yet. Ron Perlman does a bang-up job as Hellboy who fell to Earth through a portal that was opened by the Nazi's in 1941. What separates Perlman's Hellboy from the rest is his ascerbic wit and undeniably likeable human qualities (i.e. compassion and love). But, don't get me wrong this is no lovefest. Hellboy is a killer plain and simple. He was raised by a loving scientist to rid the world of evil, so when things go wrong he's the one they call in. The movie has plenty of action and outstanding special effects that rival the X-Men series. Guillermo Del Toro does a masterful job of directing and uses the FX effectively. Overall, Hellboy is definitly worth a watch and for hardcore sci-fi or comic buffs it's a must own. Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>'Hellboy' has every good element that makes a great film -- interesting characters and original visions of the world.  Though the story itself is derivative, and the special effects are no longer the greatest attraction these days (because of the flood of CGIs), 'Hellboy' still proves two things: 1) You don't need big budget to make a good film.  2) and so-called 'Stars' neither.  Nick Cage as Hellboy? Who said that?<br /><br />Anyway, the film based on Dark Horse comic book hero starts with a not-so-surprising scene in which the Nati soldiers (not again, please...) opens the portal that leads to the dark side of the world, in short, the Hell.  Their plans are disturned by the Allied troops and one Professor, but before the portal is destroyed completely, one boy comes into this side of the world -- 'Hellboy.'<br /><br />Cue to the present-day.  Now Hellboy is a hired (or kept) member of special task force in the secret department of the US government, and is fighting against the evil.  This time, however, the enemy is a bit strange, for the monster is attacking the old musuem.  The dark force that once tried to unleash the power of the Hell again stand before the hero, and his sidekick 'Abe' Sapien, who can read the past by touching.<br /><br />But the greatest part of the film is not the story, which is nothing new; it is the personality of Hellboy, who smokes cigars constantly, and speaks with a good amount of sarcasm, like a veteran cop in film noir.  And he could be also very sentimantal at times for he is in love with a lady Liz, who unwittingly emits fire all around her when enraged.<br /><br />Director Guillermo Del Toro insisted that Ron Perlman play the lead, and his choice turned out 100% right.  Perlman literally becomes the hero (with a great help from the make-up artists) and he clearly enjoys it.  So does Selma Blair as Liz, whose career so far is far from a usual one (did you see her in 'The Sweetest Thing'?)  And most of all, Del Toro knows what he is doing, and what is needed to make a good comic book hero, to whom we must relate as a credible character.  Hellboy is.<br /><br />With occasional dry humor -- see how Hellboy talks with a kid about his love, spying on Liz -- and effectively used special effects, 'Hellboy' is a film not only for comic book fans, but for general film fans.  Entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>Sixty years ago Hitler's Thule Society performs a dark ceremony intended to summon a terrible demon into this world in order to usher in the apocalypse.  Thwarted by the allies, the dark magicians fail...but not before a child slips through from the demon realm.  An infant demon in which through the care and guidance from those who oppose the evil forces, would become Hellboy, the greatest weapon the forces of darkness ever had to face.<p>It seems Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy is the closest thing ever to the second coming of Ash.  You know, the guy from the Evil Dead trilogy that just ruled over every single person lucky enough to see him on screen.  No one BUT Ron Perlman could've brought this character to life in such a glorious manner.  However, it is very clear that without Ron Perlman and his clever dialogue, this movie could have been nowhere near as awesome as it turned out to be.  But enough about Ron Perlman, on to Guillermo del Toro.  Superb action director of Mimic and Blade II, del Toro also is known for his moody aptmospheres and gothic style (check out Cronos or The Devil's Backbone).  Hellboy is the ultimate combination of both the intense dramatic action sequences of Blade II and the stylish cinematography of Cronos.  Though not my favorite del Toro film (that would The Devil's Backbone), Hellboy is a lot more than dumb comic book fun if you give it a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;Hellboy&quot; is the movie adapted from a comic book for people who did not read the comic book, which, in this case, would be me.  That means I was free of any and all preconceptions regarding characters, casting, and plot this time around, unlike previous experiences with Batman, Spider-Man, and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  But even from a tabula rassa perspective it is hard to believe that anybody other than Ron Perlman could have played the title role in &quot;Hellboy.&quot;  <p>The first key point about this movie is that &quot;Hellboy&quot; works even before Perlman shows up as Big Red and takes over the movie.  We begin in 1944 in Scotland, where a bunch of Nazis have shown up in order to open an inter-dimensional portal to the dark side and summon forth the Seven Gods of Chaos.  True, this is going to end the world, which is probably a bit more than Hitler was bargaining for, but it seems that the original Russian mad monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), his Aryan bride of death Ilsa (Bridget Hodson), and the blade loving Nazi psycho Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) have a slightly different agenda.  Fortunately, young Professor Trevor Broom (Kevin Trainor), FDR's psychic advisor, and the U.S. Army stop the Nazi plot.  The portal is closed, but not before a little red-skinned horned demon comes through from the other side.  <p>We jump ahead to the present, where the rumored sightings of Hellboy are a tabloid staple.  Young clean-cut F.B.I. agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) becomes a part of the agency's Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense where Professor Broom (John Hurt) introduces him to &quot;Abe&quot; Sapien (Doug Jones does the acting but the voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce), a fish like mind-reader/psychic and the adult Hellboy in all of his glory.  Meanwhile, sixty years later Rasputin and his sidekicks are back again and have managed to unleash a monster from inside a statue at the museum.  The fun part about this particular monster is that every time you kill one, two more are born to take its place.  Hellboy has his work cut out for him this time, but Rasputin and Kroenen do something that makes this really personal for our hero.<p>But the ending of the world as we know it is a minor problem compared to Hellboy's love life, which is fixated on the melancholy Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  She is a pyrokineticist who bursts into flames when she gets excited or angry.  He is a seven-foot red skinned demon from another dimension who is impervious to fire, so it is clearly a perfect match.  But once John convinces Liz to come back to the fold they start spending time together, forcing Hellboy to sneak around on rooftops spying on them.  However, this is all just a prelude to the final showdown with the bad guys and their monsters.  More than any other comic book superhero on the big screen, Hellboy really takes a pounding.  But the big guy keeps coming back for more.<p>Perlman is pitch perfect as Hellboy, his baritone voice providing depth to the character beyond the awesome makeup job.  Working from Mike Mignola's Dark Horse comic books, director Guillermo del Toro (&quot;Blade II&quot;) creates a suitable gothic atmosphere for Hellboy to have his knockdown drag out battles.  But the star here is Perlman's Hellboy.  This is pitch-perfect casting and Perlman is even better here than he was as Vincent on television's &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;  If anything, he is bigger and better than the movie he is in, which is a pretty good accomplishment for a comic book movie.  This guy watches out for kittens during a fight.  What is not to love about Hellboy?</p></br></body></html>

It was released in 1993 & starred Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Marcus Gilbert, and the more widely known Bridget Fonda. The screenplay for the movie was written, mostly, in 1988. Sadly, though, this movie didn't do so well at the box-office. Yet, with it's release on video and DVD, it's found moderate success and has also garnered a cult following like the first two movies. In my opinion, it's the best movie out of them all. It's spawned comics, videogames. It's inspired in songs and horror stories. In this installment, Ash is sent back to Medieval times in his Oldsmobile, an event caused by reading a spell from The Book of the Dead to defeat the demons from the last movie. He is believed to be the 'hero from the sky' destined to deliver salvation to mankind from the "Deadites". The only way to return to his time and stop the Deadites, according to a priest, is to retrieve the Necronomicon. This proves to be quite a task for Ash. Without giving away the rest of the movie, let's just say Ash has his work cut out for him. Will he make it back to his time and defeat the Deadites? You'll have to watch the movie and see.<br /><br />Although this is a fine finish to a great trilogy, I hope it isn't the last we see of Ol' Ash. Hopefully, down the road at some point, we'll see Ash return again for another adventure.<br /><br />Til then, do yourself a favor and add this gem to the rest of your collection. It's a great movie and another classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Sam Raimi's "Army of Darkness" is one of the best horror-comedy movies ever made. Bruce Campell is very funny in this movie and delivers some of the most memorable one-liners ever said.(Play Duke Nukem on the PC and you'll hear Bruce Campell's lines from this movie in the game.) The story is well written and paced very well. The acting is spotty but the main characters do the job nicely. I loved this movie and would recommend it to any one who loves an off the wall adventure. Get it on DVD.<br /><br />Like Sam Raimi (the director of AOD), I prefer the Theatrical Cut. The director's cut is interesting though, because we get to see more scenes with Evil Ash, a love scene between Shiela and Ash, more scenes with the Mini-Ash's, an alternate opening to the movie, an extended version of the final battle scene, and the original "apocalypse" ending.<br /><br />P.S. If you're looking for a commentary for this movie, check out the Director's Cut disc(s).</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>When is a horror movie funny? When Sam Raimi teams up with Bruce Campbell in what has to be the craziest mix of an entertaining script with a great big heaping scoop of the living dead. Army of Darkness if the third installment of the Evil Dead series and is probably the funnest, and that's saying a lot. The film is rather quirky in its film style, but that's the beauty of it. If you ever wanted to laugh in the face of zombies this is the best place to do it.<br /><br />Although this is a sequel to the previous Evil Dead movies you don't have to worry about not seeing the previous movies. It all ties in quite nicely with a quick little intro, which is all you really need to get back up to speed. Also this one goes into a very different direction in regards to the plot and a lot of the scenes while still giving you a few scenes that feel right at home with those of you who loved the last one. The script is great with some of the best one liners and site gags you can find in movies. Bruce Campbell definitely has made his character, Ash, his own and has taken him to new heights with Army of Darkness.<br /><br />The special effects are decidedly Raimi style with a combination of low budget effects like stop motion and cheap animatronics along with some impressive makeup and practical effects. The thing is they all blend in a very enjoyable way. When a special effect is cheesy Raimi knows how to play it to the hilt and he knows how to make the more refined effects just as outrageous. The movie isn't technically perfect and in a way it seems to revel in it. Little plot holes poke in now and then (like Ash's double barrel shotgun having the ability to shoot more than two shots at a time) but again it feels like they are almost deliberate.<br /><br />If you can watch a horror type movie that is more tongue in cheek than anything else then this is definitely the movie for you. It's very rough around the edges, but in a polished way (confusing eh?). The real trick is you cannot under any circumstances take the movie seriously. The movie doesn't do that and as long as you don't either you should have a blast watching Army of Darkness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>Despite my dislike for Evil Dead 2, I have to admit that Army of Darkness is actually a successful film.  Unlike Evil Dead, the acting pulls off the comedy smoothly, and there is never even a gesture towards being a serious film.  From the moment Ash (Bruce Campbell) is sucked into the infinite and plopped down in a medieval world, chainsaw, shotgun, and all, everything is played for gags, and this time it works.<br /><br />Take a dab from A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, through in an entire host of the undead and you pretty much have the story line.  Ash is dripped into the middle of a battle between Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and Duke Henry (Richard Grove).  Arthur, the victor, promptly drops Ash in a pit where the undead roam.  Ash gets royally ticked off and makes tiny little pieces of the opposition.  As he crawls out from the hole, the local wiseman (Ian Abercrombie) pronounces him The Promised One, and we are off to the races.<br /><br />Or rather, off to the graveyard, where the local copy of the Necronomicon has made its home.  Managing to forget the words of the releasing spell (klaatu barada nikto) and manages to release the entire deadite army.  But Ash is not to be undone - he wants to go home to his job managing the sporting goods section and it is going to take a whole lot more than a few 1,000 ugly corpses to stop him.<br /><br />As I've said, this film works the best of Director Raimi's series.  In part, I think, because Ash starts out mad, and plays the maniacal cowboy knight to a tee.  In addition, the choreography for the final showdown is excellent, and the script actually has a number of good lines in it.  None of that bad film makes good nonsense here, this was written to be a good film, and it really turned out that way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Well I can say with absolute certainly that I wasn't expecting THIS, haha!<br /><br />Army of Darkness is about a man who gets transported 700 years back to a time when people are fighting with swords and shields, however his arrival isn't initially meant with pleasure and open arms.  Instead it's met with dissension and hostility.  Well what's interesting is that, what at first seems like a typical Indiana Jones type adventure eventually morphs into the WEIRDEST MOVIE EVER!<br /><br />Let me describe what I mean.  The man wants to get back to his present time no matter what, right?  In order to do so he has to walk through a mountain and search for a magical book however... as soon as THIS particular adventure happens, the storyline completely changes into whacked out, psychedelic-influenced oddness.<br /><br />NOW suddenly the man is running from miniature people that are hilarious in their antics to bring the man down (such as shooting tiny cannonballs at his head and jumping inside of his mouth) and later on when the man discovers three books sitting on a pile of rocks, he has to pick the one that has the ability to take him back to his time however... he keeps picking the wrong one, and each book has their own unique set of mind-screwing characteristics.<br /><br />One book for example has a vortex inside of it that tries to suck the man to another dimension, the other book actually lifts in the air and attaches and squeezes onto the mans face.  I have to admit, it was quite freaky watching the segment where the man was running from something BIG but was apparently invisible.  Whatever it was kept splitting the trees in half while running through the woods.  VERY creepy.<br /><br />It's creepy scenes like the ones I mention above that might do more harm to a childs imagination than help, which makes me wonder what kind of audience this movie is intended for.  Oh and the second half of the movie focuses around the man and his newfound friends battling moving skeletons with swords and shields.  Let me tell you something about moving skeletons... THEY CREEP ME OUT!  I've always had a huge fear of skeletons, and their movements in this movie are downright bizarre and trigger what nightmares are made of, haha.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is that the man was just suddenly THERE at another place and time, with no dramatic or exciting build-up.  Having such a build-up would have allowed viewers to really pull for the guy to escape harm since there'd now be a good reason for him to return back to his time.  Small complaint.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely an adventure movie with more violence than I went in expecting, but the amount of excitement is overwhelmingly awesome so I believe you should watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>I watched the whole Evil dead trilogy and so far this is my favorite of all 3 movies. It's funnier then the first two, plus it has more characters, more fighting scenes and cool re-made stuff, like the car that was made in a battle machine and so on. The whole movie is amazing. What made me sad is that there will be no 4th movie as far as i can tell and the movie is a little over an hour in length. This is it. A very sad thing. Bruce played really good in all the movies. And it's incredibly fun to watch the Army of Darkness. It's a really great classic movie, give it a watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Campy beyond belief (and intentionally so), Army of Darkness is not a particularly good movie and the weakest of its trilogy, but worth a look if you're in the mood for some schlocky comedy delivered by camp-master Bruce Campbell.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>While Evil Dead attempted to be a serious horror film, and the sequel merged over into sillier thrills, Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness (also known as Bruce Campbell vs. the Army of Darkness) capitalizes on pure schlock. It takes every element that was terrifying in the pokerfaced original and turns it into pure comedy. And what a brilliant decision, as Army of Darkness has since gained a cult classic status and an unbelievable following. Hilarious and unexpectedly adventurous, this horror/comedy is like Indiana Jones meets Sinbad in the three worlds of Gulliver.<br /><br />S-Mart department store clerk Ash (Bruce Campbell) is being dragged to his death after getting transported through time to 1300 A.D. with his car and a shotgun. He narrates the events that led up to his capture by Lord Arthur, which include the battling of possessed demons from the first two movies Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2. The Necronomicon, the book of the dead, is responsible for his arrival in medieval times, and he must seek it out once again to return him back to the present. Along the way he'll have to unite Arthur and his nemesis Henry the Red ("well, hello Mr. Fancypants") to defend a kingdom against an undead army of darkness.<br /><br />Considering that the second film in the Evil Dead trilogy is actually a remake of the first, the events that are recapped at the opening of Army of Darkness hardly matter. The entirety of this film is directed in a humorous manner and for the first time is completely intentionally cheesy. Spotlighting on Ash's signature bad one-line insults and quips, Army of Darkness never surrenders a chance to crack a joke.<br /><br />Having lopped off his hand previously, Ash wields a chainsaw mounted on his bloody stump and at one point builds a mechanical metal hand before journeying in search of the Necronomicon. He also makes use of his legendary "boomstick" shotgun to frighten the primitive screw-head natives in a clash of time-disorienting cultures. The slapstick and gags that arise from his hilarious confrontations with medieval warriors and various possessed creatures are constant - he fights an army of mini-Ash's like a sadistic Gulliver, duels an evil version of himself like an accelerated mutant version of Richard E. Grant in How to Get Ahead in Advertising, combats a pit witch like Luke Skywalker with Jabba's Rancor (and escapes via his belt like a tongue-in-cheek Indiana Jones), and melees all sorts of skeleton warriors like Sinbad on crack.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation, priceless makeup effects and dated CG account for much of the film's splendid nonsense, and equally striking prosthetics, gunpowder-making training montages, and epic medieval battles account for the rest of this unpredictably swashbuckling horror-adventure. In his own way he's still a king, as Ash recounts at the still-jesting conclusion, and in its own way Army of Darkness is the king of cult classic laugh-a-minute horror comedies.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is a movie that has grown on me with age. I love it now for what it is and always has been. Army of Darkness solidified Bruce Campbell as a cult hero and he carries this film with his funny line delivery and one huge chin. The special effects and sets are pretty bad, but it's all about the campy fun from start to finish. There are some classic scenes and lines you will feel compelled to quote to people, probably getting you many blank stares from those who have not witnessed Ash in action.<br /><br />I have the Boomstick version with the original and director's cut. I like them both, but the picture quality sucks on the DC, so I usually watch the theatrical version.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were at a pinnacle for this genre making this movie. Nothing comes close in my book of horror comedies. I love all their other work, but this stands the test of time well and will crack most people up whatever their age. This movie is quoted regularly at gatherings of people partying, and it makes a great party movie. AOD is a superb mix of horror movie and comedy. The first two Evil Dead movies although entertaining are mainly horror with less comedy. Many fans adore them although the third in the series was much more to my liking.<br /><br />An S-Mart employee has barely escaped a horrible experience in the woods where his friends were killed and he lost his hand. He has replaced it with a chainsaw attachment and he has a double barreled shotgun as well. Driving his 1973 Oldsmobile as fast as he can he is teleported while trying to escape. He ends up in medieval times and must prove himself to the local Lord by recovering a book of the dead. What ensues is comic genius as he fights skeletons, demons, witches, and himself. Excellent DVD with some extras. If you enjoyed this catch "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Hotshots! Part Deux".<br /><br />P.S. I recently bought the HD DVD and it would not play on a DVD player that plays all formats, a region free DVD player, or my PC (locked up DVD player bad and it did not have eject button so that I had to disconnect cables in order to use the PC). I suggest you stay away fron it.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/AKMEY1BSHSDG7.html">AKMEY1BSHSDG7</a><br/><p>I love cheesey horror movies! I love The Three Stooges!<br /><br />How could I NOT love this film? My God, it's sheer perfection!!</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Having abandoned genuine scares in favor of all-out slapstick, Army of Darkness, the third entry in the Evil Dead series sees Bruce Campbell lost in time, low on gas, surrounded by evil and facing the Medieval Dead with only a chainsaw, a '73 Oldsmobile, his trusty boomstick and a lot of attitude in a film that owes more to Ray Harryhausen than George A. Romero, albeit with an R-rating (it's one of the last films to use stop-motion extensively, with more sword-wielding skeletons than Harryhausen managed in his entire career). Never quite as much fun as you'd like it to be, it's certainly aged much better than expected - initially regarded as a disappointment, today it stands up rather well, especially when seen away from its two more small-scale predecessors. Joe LoDuca's unapologetically old-fashioned epic score is a lot of fun too, particularly cues like `Manly Men' and `Building the Deathmobile.'<br /><br />There's no shortage of different editions of the film on DVD, and the fact that Amazon have lumped all the reviews for them in one big identical heap that appears on every editions page doesn't help sort them out. Seeing the two versions of the film side by side on Anchor Bay's 2-disc DVD (issued as the Special Edition and the Boomstick edition) - the US theatrical version with the S-Mart ending and the longer director's `Bootleg cut' with the original `Planet of the Apes' ending, the differences in the longer version are mainly extended scenes rather than deleted ones, though the use of a few alternate takes means that some of the most quotable lines from the shorter version are lost ("Good, bad, I'm the one with the gun." "Maybe my men can hold them. Maybe I'm a Chinese jet pilot." "Hail to the king, baby.") and the picture quality is a lot softer. It has to be said that both versions have their merits: there's a bit of repetition in the long version (Marcus Gilbert's every other line in the last half hour seems to be "We are deserted!") and while a lot of good stuff was lost when the film was trimmed for the US, the shorter version IS a lot snappier and the S-Mart Dedite ending is quite fun even if it doesn't set up the will-it-ever-get-made Evil Dead 4 promised in the original ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Army of Darkness is a fine finish to a series of films that started with the classic movie The Evil Dead in 1982.

I had always avoided most zombie and Undead flicks, but this one sucked me in.  Bruce Campbell takes himself so seriously, and the action is so wacky that the horrifying Undead creatures are not the main focus.  Sure, I was pinching the seat a bit, but the humorous scenes were relief from the Insane Lovecraftian creatures.<br /><br />The superhero was so smug and sure of himself that he inducted me into Zombie / Undead flicks, and I've always loved this Campy movie.  This is one of those flicks that you can watch again and again.  Also, if you can't get people to watch Undead films, this is a good initiation for your squeamish friends.  I wouldn't start them off with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3864">The Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Army of Darkness is one to treasure, and it is always good for laughs amongst fellow geeks.

A movie that is well done for the low budget.

Surprisingly, while it was the least popular of the series in theaters, it's arguably now the biggest cult hit in the series!<br />Picking up where ED2 left off, Ash (Bruce Campbell) finds himself in 1400 A.D., taken prisoner by Arthur's knights.  Soon, he finds that the only way he can return to his own time is to retrieve the Necronomicon (a.k.a. Book of the Dead).  Of course, there are some complications: he'll also have to save his girlfriend, blow up his evil clone, and destroy an army of the dead.  Armed with those ever-so-trusty weapons, the double-barreled shotgun and chainsaw, Ash sets out on his quest to return home.<br />&quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is one of the few films that successfully blends comedy with horror.  AOD is, in fact, much more comedy than horror.  Ash is outrageous, albeit a little more pissy than in the previous films.<br />One of the interesting things to do with this film is to look back at the other two films and see how far along the ED crew came.  Bruce Campbell's acting improved by ED2, Sam Raimi became a more experienced director, the scripts changed from gore-filled horror to laugh-out-loud comedy, Joseph LoDuca went from creepy 70's horror score to booming medieval soundtrack...<br />There are two versions of the film: the original theatrical version (nicely remastered on this DVD) as well as the Director's Cut (horridly &quot;mastered&quot; on this DVD).  I would highly recommend the D.C. to the T.C., but with the quality of the D.C. on this DVD, I can understand it if you stick with the T.C.  (Woah, that was a mouthful!)<br />All in all, &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is even more rockin' now then it was ten years ago.  Filled with bone-rattling action and groovy comedy, AOD is a film only Sam Raimi could make.<br />&quot;Shop smart, shop S-Mart!&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Proving you can't keep a good deadite slayer down, Army of Darkness marks the return of Ash in the third film of the highly popular Evil Dead trilogy. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is no longer confined to the isolated cabin in the woods, now that he's been transported to the 14th century (don't ask), apparently somewhere in England. He's seen as an enemy by the local Lord Arthur, but quickly becomes hero and savior to the people when he kills a couple of deadites. Consequently, and in order to return to his time, he's sent on a quest to retrieve the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead. What should be a simple task results in the creation of the army of darkness, which Ash must battle to keep evil from spreading throughout the land.<p>Army of Darkness' plot is pure nonsense, sort of a mix of Monty Python and just about every fantasy movie you may have seen. The entire movie's success is based on humor, and it delivers with consistent comic ingenuity. All traces of horror its predecessors had is all but gone here, those expecting to experience terror with their mirth will be sorely disappointed. Army of Darkness is a silly comedy from beginning to end, and it revels in its silliness.<p>Easily the movie's anchor and probably the only reason I couldn't stop giggling for all 81 minutes is cult fave and comic genius Bruce Campbell. Roles of this kind are perfectly suited for him, and he doesn't disappoint. Whether it's his sharp one-liners, priceless facial reactions, or general good-nature about making a complete fool of himself, Campbell is hilarious as Ash. This is undoubtedly my favorite performance of his, period.<p>Director Sam Raimi shows off his usual kinetic style, delivering plenty of zooms and swirling camera movements. Most of the action sequences (and there are a LOT of them) are played equally for laughs and thrills, but probably succeed at the former slightly more successfully than the latter. The only movie I can think of that managed to keep its action completely thrilling while consistently mingled with silly physical humor is Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (which obviously gained inspiration from this movie)(Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade also accomplished the task, but boasted better and less silly physical gags).  <p>As much as I enjoyed Army of Darkness, it's not as if though the movie couldn't have been improved. Some jokes fall flat and the concept of Ash fighting his evil twin hardly lives up to its full potential. While the intentionally cheesy and fun special effects and make-up effects are perfectly suited for the film, I would have preferred more sets. Most of the movie is based around one castle (albeit a very large one), without even a small village surrounding it; kind of gives off that low-budget vibe (though it's easily the most expensive of the Evil Dead series).<p>The director's cut attaches another fifteen minutes to the movie, most of which neither hampers the movie nor enhances its enjoyment. In fact, I would have welcomed this 96-minute cut if not for the alternate ending, which may be more in tone with the trilogy, but doesn't measure up to the hilarious S-Mart finale of the theatrical cut. As far as comparison with its predecessors, it's different enough in tone to not warrant any comparisons, but what the hell, I'll give one, anyway. Army of Darkness is more consistently enjoyable than Evil Dead 2 (which wasn't scary and only sporadically funny), but not up to par with the original The Evil Dead (which remains one of the most frightening films I've ever seen).</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7.html">A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7</a><br/><p>Before I start let me say this has nothing to do with Evil Dead 2<br />(this is Evil Dead 3 if you did not know).

I believe that this is the 4th edition, and is so far the best. Why they couldn't have released this edition in the first place, I'll never know, but it would have definitely save me some pocket change.<p>The &quot;Boomstick&quot; edition is more or less a compiling of both versions of the film, the US Theatrical Version and the Director's Edition. Here are the differences:<p>Theatrical Version: This is the one I prefer, because it is more of a comedy that a horror movie. It is the version everybody saw first, and it has all the classic moments from the VHS and initial DVD release. <p>Director's Version: This is the same as the &quot;Official Bootleg Cut&quot; that came out last year. It boasts 15 minutes of never-before-seen footage, but it comes at the expence of other scenes that were cut out. Gone are many of the good battle scenes, much of the comedy, different dialogue and music, and a different ending that is lousy. Overall, this version is different, more of a standard horror movie. I always believe there is merit in what the director intended, but this is one of those cases where the alternate version was the better one. <p>The behind-the-scenes featurette presented by Bruce Campbell is excellent, as always. I always love his commentaries and his voice overs, he is always insightful and can always laugh at himself. As good as the extras are, though, it doesn't make the package. If you already own the Theatrical Version and the Director's &quot;Bootleg&quot; Edition, I wouldn't bother with this one. That is unless you have too much money burning a hole in your pocket.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>Ash is back.

This DVD edition is THX mastered, so he  quality is crispy and clear, and  some of the sound effects will rock your  living room.

While the set pieces, battle sequences, and cinematography are as masterful as any Spielberg film, "Army of Darkness" was obviously made simply with the idea of making it an all-out entertaining picture and it succeeds in that way, on every level. The physical comedy element from "Evil Dead 2" returns with a vengeance; I've seen this movie more than fifty times and every gag still works. But instead of the cabin in the woods and sense of isolation that we felt in the preceeding two films, "AOD" has the scope of a grand-scale sword and sorcery epic, using its visual effects to turn backlots in Los Angeles into vast stretches of woodsy nothingness.<p>The movie's not much in the area of plot. It doesn't need to be. Movies like "Army of Darkness" are not about elaborate plot devices and subplots and dramatic pauses; they're about action, and giving us as the popcorn-stuffing audience members a good time for our money. A lot of the credit for all these successes goes to Bruce Campbell, as our main everyman character: The moron, the braggart, the blowhard, Ash. God love em. True, the idea of Ash being a cowardly character has completely left the story for the idea of him becoming this leader of men that we root for. True, the logistics of the film suffered in the editing process. And true, we never really see Ash reload his gun before he fires again. But does it matter? Not at all. The film moves too fast for us to care. The action sequences are so well executed that we can forgive the movie for just about anything, and the fact that it has an enormous sense of humor about itself doesn't hurt either. Classifying it as a horror film does it a discredit. It's not a horror film at all; it's not even one of those self-parodies that are so popular these days since Kevin Williamson had the cahones to write "Scream". It's an action-comedy that sky rockets into a stratosphere all its own in both categories. Both coexist in perfect balance most of the time, once in a while tipping in one direction or the other. The result is a masterpiece.<p>Sam Raimi learned a lot from the days of "Evil Dead" developing an involving visual style and a sense for drama which he used on "A Simple Plan" and "The Gift". This is all well and good, and those films gave him the critical merit to direct "Spider-man", but I think his job on "Army of Darkness" gave him the real tools needed. And even if "Spider-man" becomes the enormous success that's expected, he'll always be remembered for his cult favorite series that began with a group of college kids in a cabin being killed off by an invisible force, one by one, leaving only Ash, who lived and carries "Army of Darkness" on his shoulders - bouncing up and down with laughter all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S9887MZFNNH1.html">A3S9887MZFNNH1</a><br/><p>This is absolutely hilarious. It's not a hum drum horror film, it's a very comical horror. This is the 3rd EVIL DEAD film and it's very different and enjoyable. Watch out for a copy of FANGORIA horror magazine and a zombie  character played by Bill Mosely (texas chainsaw massacre 2)</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>4 of 5 stars for the ah ah sci-fi? action? fantasy movie Army of Darkness. I first looked at the cover art and read the liner notes and thought "here we go with a real-B movie, sigh". I started watching and it was funny and interesting. Watching the Blu-Ray I was really impressed with the image quality--super sharp and clear, it looked almost like video rather than film. So early-on, I'm thinking this is a spoof movie, but no, it was a straight fantasy/comedy movie. Then it hit me! This is a tribute to the Ray Harryhousen movie (Sinbad). Then I noticed this movie has everything from stop-action creatures, alot of rubber suits and alot of real models of creatures. Yeah, some CG, but not much. It really has the look and feel of the old Sinbad movies.<br /><br />The plot is of a "S-mart" sales guy getting transported to the 1300's to fight against Deadites and recover an artifact book. Bruce Campbell did an outstanding job in the lead role. This movie was a pleasure to watch. Stupid comedy in places, old-style effects, silly quest and it is all fun fun fun! This is on my watch-it-again list.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>Using advanced scientific techniques, I've isolated the three basic reasons why Sam Raimi's "Army of Darkness" exists.  They are:<p>1.  To quench the appetite of those Raimi-files not sated by the gore-and-goofiness of "The Evil Dead" and "The Evil Dead II":<p>Yes, it's pretty gory:  A fire hose caliber spray of blood erupts from a torture pit; an evil deadite appears to have no lips or skin; animated skeletons get run over by a beat up yellow Oldsmobile.  But thankfully, it is also very goofy: the arms of buried bodies poke through the ground to perform a neatly choreographed Three Stooges routine; an army of mini-Bruce Campbells appears, and attack their Gulliver-sized doppelganger, Lilliputian-style; an evil witch is blown to pieces by a double-barreled department store shotgun, as the audience gets the bullets'-eye-view.  The meshing of gore and goof is a Raimi trademark, and it is in no small supply here.  Prepare to hold your stomach, because you'll either have the urge to vomit, or need to hold in your omnipresent laughter.<p>2.  To show off contemporary versions (circa 1990) of Ray Harryhausen-esque stop-motion techniques:<p>The special effects, while dated in the face of CGI prodigiousness, are enormous and spectacular.  A vast skeletal army emerges from the darkness, each with his/her own unique personality and movement.  The battle they undertake is credible and real and awe-inspiring.  It is ridiculously hyper-kinetic, full of carnage and mayhem, more than any climactic fight scene I've ever seen.  Never put anything past Sam Raimi.  Even on a miniscule budget he can create something that'll knock your socks off, and tickle your feet.<p>3.  To give the glorious Bruce Campbell more moments to shine.<p>Above all else, this is the real reason why this movie exists (Raimi thinks so: by the opening credits alone you'd swear the movie was called "Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness").  Campbell has the unique ability to play Ash, hero of the first two "Evil Dead" movies, as both intensely cool and dumb as a post.  It's a nice mix that allows him to display the pomposity of a superhero and the self-awareness of a post-modern ironist.  One scene in particular shows this off nicely.  It takes place in a graveyard, in front of an altar where the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) is kept.  Only there are three books, a number Ash wasn't expecting.  Casually opening the first one, he reveals a powerful vacuum/vortex, sucking into its gaping maw all that come near.  Ash is one of the first casualties.  But he emerges heroically, unharmed except for a ridiculously elongated chin.  The joke is that Campbell's chin is his most notorious selling point (he called his autobiography "If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B-movie Actor").  Mocking himself so mercilessly, it becomes an even more delicious moment.<p>His other skill, besides his self-deprecating sense of humour, is his delivery.  Raimi and his brother Ivan deliver an almost purposefully banal script, knowing full well that the verve and intensity of Campbell's delivery will amplify its humour.  And they're right.  Ash's lines, so eminently quotable, appear rather dull when typed out ("Groovy", "Hold on Mr. Fancy Pants", "Baby you got ugly", and "Baby give me some sugar" being the most notorious examples).  The power comes from the way Campbell's reading is combined with the way Raimi sets up these lines perfectly: a dramatic pause, then a quick zoom in on Bruce's loopy mug, then the slick delivery of the line.  It's an addictive concoction that had me roaring in delight each time.  Furthermore, add the fact that all the actors around him play their scenes stone straight, and you find yourself wondering why Campbell isn't a bigger star.<p>"Army of Darkness" will not add up to much for those uninitiated with (or underwhelmed by) the "Evil Dead" series.  But for those that are, it's more of the good times promised by Raimi and Co.  Check your mind at the door, paste a goofy grin on your face (you'll need it later), and get set for 81 minutes of mirth and mayhem.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>The ultimate DVD version of a cult favorite has both versions of the film (one of them is the newly-restored director's cut) and every feature included on earlier VHS & DVD formats so you are pretty much getting every documentary and commentary that Anchor Bay has put out with this movie.<p>Funny thing is I own all three video formats (original Universal video, Anchor Bay's 1999 widescreen, and the original limited edition director's cut VHS) and I also bought the bootleg cut on DVD. That's right. I have now purchased this movie five different times. This one DVD has everything included on the four editions that I already purchased (with the exception of the ability to play on a VCR and give or take a few Universal Studios trailers). If only I hadn't spent over $... on those other four because I got this one for like $.... <p>Anyways, this movie is a true cult classic. The third entry in the Evil Dead series with Bruce Campbell going back in time to battle a handful of evil spirits.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>The third installment of the Evil Dead series and for years and years...I'm hoping not the last.While this Evil Dead film is toned down and "comic booked up" quite a bit from its previous counterparts,it is all the more fun and entertaining.Ash is back(right where we left him off)-stuck back in time without a clue,his chainsaw,the Oldsmobile and his "boomstick" and more attitude and wise cracks to help rid the land of the "Evil Dead".This is a throughly enjoyable film and "kid friendly" from about the age of 10 and up.There are a few curse words here and there,but if your kid has Play Station games(unless they are "G" rated) he/she has already been introduced to an arangement of swears and curses(whether you have heard them or not).The Army of Darknss is great fun to watch,Sam Rami hasn't forgotten his roots and the three stoges humor and scares are abundent.Bruce Campbell is the ultimate "B" movie actor with phenominal comedic timing.Something honed to perfection from his relationship with Rami made many moons ago.Well worth owning,but will truely be enjoyed with the viewing/purchase of Evil Dead II,Dead before Dawn.I laughed until my sides split uncontrollibly as well as revelled in Ash's timeless one liners."Hail to the King Baby",the Evil Dead is here to stay.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Props to Sam Raimi for making a film that defies the typical conventions of horror. As he did for the last two Evil Dead films (even though the second was a higher budget remake of the first) he was poking fun at the horror genre. Moreover, let's face it, there's a lot to be made fun of.<br /><br />When I read the plot description, I was certain that this film would be disastrous. Ash, going back in time, to the Middle Ages nonetheless, to help King Arthur win a battle against the "army of the dead". It was preposterous. Yet somehow, he pulled it off. The same irreverent wit that fueled the low budget first film, and the slightly higher budget second film, was in full display here. In addition, I understood why horror buffs are interested in an Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason film. Actually, the only reason I watched Evil Dead was to understand why Ash would play a pivotal role if that film was ever made. Now I know. And I hope that they make it - and I hope that someone talented writes the script and directs it. Freddy vs. Jason was a complete disaster.<br /><br />Nothing about this film made sense, and that was the brilliance of it. Where did Ash come up with a Chemistry 101 textbook that taught him how to make gunpowder? How was he able to escape the first Necromonicon book when it sucked him in with (apparently) the force of a tornado? And how was Ash capable of teaching many of Arthur's knights how to "really" fight? Seriously - this may have been the Middle Ages, but these guys knew how to handle a halberd, and knew how to handle it better than Ash.<br /><br />But that was the brilliance of the film. It poked fun at just about everything, and when it wasn't poking fun it was paying homage. When Henry the Red's forces aligned at the top of a hilltop to fall upon the Army of Darkness, that was straight out of The Lord of the Rings. And I'm not talking about the movie, which was made almost a decade later. I'm talking about the book, which was written thirty years prior. However, that's not a criticism. It's part of a hysterical script that was not supposed to be taken seriously. Horror films fall into two categories: those that are meant to be taken seriously, and those that poke fun at themselves. Army of Darkness fell into the latter, and did a marvelous job. I found myself laughing aloud at *several* points. It was ingenious.<br /><br />Even non-horror buffs would find this amusing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>There are two types of B movies.<br />One that is so bad, it is actually unwatchable,and closer to X Y Z than B.<br />The other type, is a film that does not take itself too seriously,made by talented filmmakers,and closer to A than B: Army Of Darkness,the third installment in the Evil Dead trilogy falls squarely in the latter type.<br />To describe the film as horror however is a bit far fetched. Army of Darkness is essentially a comedy, absurd, over the top,and chaotic, but a comedy nonetheless.Even the blood and gore and those evil skeletons chasing our hero Ash (an excellent Bruce Campbell) have a comic feel to them, and this is exactly why the film works so well.The horror/comedy genre is a very grey area, and many a director has failed to get the right balance between the two,and as a result his/her film would be lost in predictable suspense and cheesy one-liners added for humour.However Sam Raimi,(like Spielberg and Tarantino,a director who has started his career early, driven by his passion for cinema),succeeds in sticking to absurd comedy,all dressed up nicely in the tension of the 'horror' atmosphere.<br />This edition is the best to own, because it includes Raimi's original movie, butchered at the time of its release by the studio.This saddens me to no end, to see executives who have no artistic or creative bone in them, deciding what the audience would like or not, and tampering with the director's own vision,(sometimes relying on a 'test audience'-but they are to creativity what a mosquito is to a good night sleep, a bloody nuisance).A very recent example of this,on the set of Exorcist 4 :The Beginning,is replacing  one of the best director/auteur in American cinema,Paul Schrader with Renny Harlin, because the studio and its test audience thought Schrader's copy was too psychological and did not have enough 'pea soups'!! what a scandal!<br />Anyway, back to Army of Darkness,<br />the studio version, which is 15 minutes less than the original film, has a sentimental happy ending, while Raimi's cut is more 'Planet of the Apes' apocalyptic, which gives an appreciative depth to the film.A lot footage was cut also from the battle scene, which although is not Lord of the Rings, it is quite well made for its budget.<br />So, Army of Darkness is a very good and hilarious B movie that you will immensly enjoy.Buy it and B entertained!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Army of Darkness was presumably the last of the Evil Dead movies, allowing, for what many fans thought, a final glimpse of the beloved anti-hero Ash.  Lighter in tone (as in it's basically a Horror/Comedy) and far less reliant on gross out makeup effects than the previous two films, Army of Darkness nevertheless stands its own as a classic Horror film.  Showcasing the amazing acting talent of Bruce Campbell by putting his character, Ash,  into hilarious and horrifying situations (ie. demons in a pit, mini-demented versions of himself in a twisted Liliputian attack, hundreds upon hundreds of skeletons, and three, yes three, Necronomicons!) Army of Darkness was for many fans a bittersweet end to a fantastic series, or was it?  <p>With the upcoming release of the Evil Dead videogame (you get to play Ash!) and many rumors of a fourth movie (please God, let it be true!) as well as a recent interview with Sam Raimi in Fangoria magazine where he openly expresses his wishes to helm a fourth Evil Dead film it seems Evil Dead fans greatest desire may quite possibly come true.  In the Fangoria interview Raimi cited his busy schedule, the lackluster box office receipts of the first 3 films, and the lack of an existing script as some minor hurdles to creating a fourth film.  As an Evil Dead fan I can vouch that I'd be right there on opening day if the film were made and I know every other Evil Dead fan would be there too.  I know the home video sales of the first 3 films have been phenomenal and that might be tantalizing enough to film producers to back the project.  I hope.  <p>If it has to be, Army of Darkness will stand as a good enough ending to the series, the movie is a fun experience and eternally re-watchable.  But Evil Dead fans want more, dammit!  And a fourth movie would be just &quot;Groovy&quot;!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>Ash works at Wal Mart as a clerk, one night he is transported to an medieval alternative reality by an evil book... the "Necronomicon ex Mortis, or "Book of the Dead".

As Campbell plays him, Ash is certainly unhinged; anyone who'd chop off his hand and replace it with a chainsaw isn't exactly sparking on all cylinders. <p> This time out, Ash finds himself transported to a strangely barren medieval England where he battles his own evil dead doppelganger for possession of a magic book that can send him back to his own era... and his job at &quot;S-Mart.&quot; Lots of knights versus skeletons mayhem ensues. <p> This is just some popcorn-munchin' entertainment, perfect for getting together with a six-pack of brew and some friends and letting director Sam Raimi and Campbell take you along for the fun. It features some nice effects- they strike the perfect balance between state-of-the-art and gorgonzola, just right for this cheeky film. The script is a hoot, with a lot of B-movie style one-liners perfectly delivered by Campbell.

I still stand by that statement, but this new edition (which feels like the umpteenth edition of the film) is the one to own if you don't already have any other edition of the film.  You get two discs, one being the original U.S. Theatrical Cut which features all of Ash's great one liners (&quot;good, bad, I'm the one with the gun&quot;) and the S-Mart ending.  The second disc is the bootleg director's cut with the post apocalyptic alternate ending and the whacky commentary from Bruce Campbell, and Sam and Ivan Raimi.  All in all, if you own any other edition of Army of Darkness on DVD, then you might feel a bit cheated if you buy this, but if you don't own any other edition, pick this up; it's a great deal.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Army of Darkness continues the Splatstick tradition of it;s predecessor Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn.

The original ending is intact, but I wish they could have found room on the disc for the ending shown in theaters, for completists like myself. The commentary by Campbell and Sam & Ivan Raimi is a laugh riot, as well as being informative, and the handful of deleted scenes are fun, too. The subtitle option enables you to see the film's storyboards in the corner of the screen while viewing the picture, and there's a small gallery of production art as well. No trailers or anything else, though.

Guess what?  AOD is not only probably a better movie in that singular genre, but it also includes all the other genres.  Imminently rewatchable, it's the perfection of an otherwise unsavory blend of King Arthur, Leslie Nielson, the combined might of a zombie and skeleton army, the special effects of Clash of the Titans, and a final showdown between good and evil that has paved the way for countless others since.  In fact, it could be argued that AOD has been the inspiration for more scripts, concepts, and subplots since its creation than is even worth mentioning.<br /><br />Aside from the aforementioned special effects - which are admittedly bad - the rest is perfection.  The homage to the Three Stooges, the trash-talking during sword fights, the hokey skeleton army storming the castle, all perfect.  Comedic timing that would make even a headliner jealous, there are numerous moments throughout the movie that illicit snorts.  Even the musical score, which blends seamlessly with the action as well as the romance, is nearly without equal.  A person going back in time several hundred years and immediately being the smartest, most powerful person is a hilarious concept because it's cemented in probability.  Not only smarter, but more than likely stronger, craftier, and better suited for an actual battle in nearly every way.  Which brings me to Bruce Campbell.<br /><br />He's absolutely untouchable as far as I'm concerned.  The fact that he doesn't placate the armor-wearing simpletons by changing his word selection, using slang that would obviously confuse and amaze all, is brilliant.  Every sword swing, shotgun blast, and taunting laugh is the epitome of entertainment.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie...WHAT is wrong with you?!  If you have, do yourself a favor; watch it again.  This is still one of the most enjoyable movies of all time.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>SHOP SMART SHOP S-MART AND BUY THIS MOVIE *smiling*<br /><br />This is just a brilliant movie!!!

Neckturn... Nickel... It's an "N" word, it's definitely an "N" word!...".In final desperation he says the first two and substitutes a drawn out cough for the last one.He looks around,nothing seemingly happens,but as he starts to return to his horse skeletal hands begin to rise up through the ground and trip him and try to grab the book.He gets away and returns to the castle.<br />He tells everyone that everything is alright,he has the book and now it's time he got returned to his own time.By now the people have thought he would stick around to fight the deadites and they are very disappointed.In the meantime the deadites have risen up from their graves and are marching on the castle.When a girl who had become infatuated with Ash is possessed by the deadites,he vows to stay and fight.It is a pitched battle but in the end good wins the day over evil and Ash is finally returned to his own time.<br />In the finale we find Ash back at work as he is explaining his exploits to some disbelieving fellow employees.Suddenly a deadite appears and Ash is forced to take action,as he grabs his weapon of choice,a boomstick(a shotgun to you Evil Dead noobs),and blasts the thing back to where it came.The film ends as Ash has a lovely lass bent over,ready for a kiss,as he utters the immortal words"Hail to the King,baby".<br />So ends the Evil Dead trilogy that really made a star out of Bruce Campbell;and rightfully so.Campbell has got to be the hardest B picture character actor in the business,along with being a very prudent and smart business man.He has written books,along with his movie work and has also directed.A man of many talents our Bruce is,and it shows that you don't have to be a Hollywood suck up to make it in films.We need more Campbells out there.<br />Technically speaking the print here is beautiful and is shown in its original a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include a featurette on the S/Fx and the alternate ending to the film.<br />All in all a recommended picture.This is the last of the Evil Dead series and shows Bruce Campbell off in his element as Ash.It is not GREAT film per se',but just a fun,fun romp in the horror genre that will have you laughing as much as jumping scared.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD trilogy concluded with this over the top comedy thriller.  In addition to having some great pre-CGI effects, the witty and delightful Bruce Campbell and some ingenious creative moments, ARMY OF DARKNESS nicely pays homage to some great classic novels and/or movies.  We get "Gulliver's Travels"; "The Thing with Two Heads"; and of course, a tribute to Ray Harryhausen's ingenious skeletons in "7th Voyage of Sinbad" and "Jason and the Argonauts."  There is kind homage also to the Three Stooges in some of the slapstick tomfoolery that occurs.  The scene of the skeletons marching into the castle with skeleton head drums; bagpipes and trumpets is priceless.  Raimi earned his credentials on these three films, enabling him to go on to higher class films and of course the superb SPIDERMAN series.  Gorgeously filmed and lit, ARMY OF DARKNESS is a marvelous movie; the theatrical ending is much more enjoyable that the Planet of the Apes one.  Enjoy.

Falling asleep during that made me totally confused as to whether this was a third Evil Dead film (duh, Bruce Campbell is Ash in all 3!), and considering it had a different name - hey, I'm easily confused. Life isn't easy for me when people throw these things at me.<br /><br /> I'm still differing as to what star to give it. Didn't really like the film at all (watchable, but not re-watchable), so that side of me wants to give it a 2. But then it has Bruce Campbell again, which kinda ups the stakes a bit - especially when he's looking all bruised and battered, you just wanna kiss him ALL better! I'm sucker for guys with cuts and bruises.<br /><br /> The film starts off with a small flashback to Evil Dead II (well, I'm assuming that anyway, since I was asleep), reminding you of what happened, before you get thrown into the thick of things. Ash is armed with a shotgun and a chainsaw arm, which you need to see the previous installment to understand - so this went straight over my head!<br /><br /> I wouldn't say this was a horror film at all, more of a comedy, coming out with some great lines, and some funny moments. Most of the funny moments come from Ash - and the &quot;mini Ash's&quot; had me in fits! The highlight of the whole film is the Mini Ash's - they're hilarious, although he manages to multiply himself by looking in and then smashing a mirror? (I'm probably gonna get picked up on that for being wrong!)<br /><br /> There are some pretty cheesy lines, one of which I was really disappointed actually came out of Ash's mouth. He says to the 'hot chick' &quot;Gimme some sugar baby&quot; - to which I responded with &quot;Gimme a break!&quot; Such a cheesy line. (The kinda line you can imagine a guy practising in front of the mirror on a Friday/Saturday night, and then going out and using it on some poor unsuspecting woman. I know what my response would be if that line was tried on me!) And then he goes on to sleep with Sheila, who goes all gooey and knock-kneed at that line. Considering he was supposed to be transported back in time to what, the 13 or 1400s, they don't seem to realise it just wasn't the done thing back then. The only contraception they had was the word &quot;no&quot;, and she wouldn't have been a virgin on her wedding night (heaven forbid!) after sleeping with dear old Ash. I wasn't keen on that section, cos it wouldn't have been done in the 'good ol' days'.<br /><br /> Apparently there's two different endings to this movie. A good ending, and a very depressing (although predictable) ending. Guess which ending I saw? The depressing one! But it's extremely predictable, especially if you count the drops - and then I still had to double check if I was right with what was gonna happen!<br /><br /> I think after seeing Bubba Ho-Tep (in which Bruce Campbell played an old and overweight Elvis) it was good to see him when he still looked quite good - although Bubba Ho-Tep is a must-see! I'm not sure about the whole Evil Dead movies franchise, they just don't appeal to me, but if you like Jim Carrey, you'll definitely see a lot of him in Bruce Campbell, and plus, he's alright on the eye!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>if Evil Dead 1 & 2 were pointless blood fests of carnage, then this is pointless and not scary nor funny Period. The 3rd/final Installment (thank god) is the worst of the worst. your a fan of the trilogy perhaps it appeals to you, this is just my opinion with all due respect.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that has been on cable TV so much that I'm pretty sure most everyone has seen some of it.  It's pretty damn silly, obviously, but isn't insultingly stupid like some horror-comedies.  It's always fun, and quite hilarious at times, mainly due to the power house performance from Bruce Campbell.  Most people seem to prefer 'Evil Dead II', and while I think that movie outshines this one in many ways, this one wins out overall due to Campbell's improved work.  Certainly, he had the physical comedy down last time, but Ash's character wasn't fully developed.  He wasn't half the surly blowhard he is here, and pretty much all of the truly classic Ash lines comes from 'Army of Darkness'.  It's too bad they never made an 'Evil Dead IV', and we might have had the best of both worlds. (And everyone is always insisting that there are no current plans to make another 'Evil Dead' film, so it probably ain't gonna happen.  Frankly, I think Bruce is probably too old to play Ash properly anymore.)<br /><br />This movie is pretty much impossible to describe, as it just kinda lurches from one random comic scenario to the next.  It's totally anarchic, and while not every scene works all that well it never gets boring.  It's a feast of intentionally cheesy special effects, with tons of great skeleton puppets and a lotta fun stop-motion animation.  Lotsa people complain about the lack of gore in 'Army of Darkness', but honestly there wasn't any real gore in 'Evil Dead II'.  Plasticky limbs flying around a bit, some spraying green or black paint and not much else.) `Evil Dead II' really wan't much of a gorehound's dream, I'm afraid.  And yeah, the serious horror elements have been reduced to about 0, but they were virtually nonexistent in that movie too.  I don't wanna dump on `Evil Dead II', I like it a lot, but the typical complaints as to why `Army of Darkness' is worse than it literally don't make much sense.  If you loved `Evil Dead II' because it was so gory and horrific, well I gotta lot of other movies you need to see.<br /><br />I've got the Boomstick edition from Anchor Bay.  This has got the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut.  Like some other reviewers, I actually think the cut you'll usually see on cable is the best one.  The final battle in the Director's Cut is too drawn out, and they cut some good lines.  Most significantly, the DC ending just isn't 1/100th as awesome as the TC ending. (I'm all for artistic integrity and whatnot, but the studios were right this time.  The TC ending is the best scene in the movie.)  The TC is fine, but it's missing a few cool things. (i.e. a couple of deleted scenes not in either version, but found on the DVD, the large blood spray on the wall, the part where Ash rips the skeleton arm out of the ground and, most significantly, the brief moment were Evil Ash spontaneously starts breathing fire.)  Obviously, it's unreasonable that they'd include a cut assembled by a third party on the DVD, but there's no denying that I like that one best.  Still, the TC is pretty close to optimal, and all that material is found somewhere on the 2 DVDs.  Overall, this is a very good DVD set, as per usual for Anchor Bay.  God, I know I'm gettin off on something irrelevant, but what's with all the idiot's whining about Anchor Bay whenever they release a DVD that is less than perfect.  What, you say that their release of `Tenebre' is missing 20 incosequential seconds of footage because of print damage, and yet they still advertise it as `uncut'.  Thost deceptive scumbags!!!!  Half of the horror movies put out by Anchor Bay would not have a remotely decent DVD release if they weren't around.  But what can I say, some people will complain regardless of what happens.<br /><br />Yeah, this movie is great.  I've seen it at least 10 times by now, but it still holds up very well, something which you might not anticipate with such a film.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>OK, here it is.  For those of you looking for a superb quality version of Army Of Darkness on DVD, buy the Universal Pictures version.  It only  includes Bios of Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Raimi, Production  Notes, and the Theatrical Trailer as bonus material, but the sound and  picture quality of the film are 100 times better than the horrible Anchor  Bay version (either the director's cut or theatrical). Take it from someone  who owns every version available, the Universal DVD is the one you want if  good quality is your thing (I know it's mine).  The only good thing on the  Anchor Bay version are the extras: audio commentary (on director's cut  version which has added scenes that look even worse than the regular film  transfer.  That's right, even the normal parts look bad on this DVD  compared to Universal), a short making of featurette (on the Anchor Bay  theatrical DVD) hosted by Bruce Campbell, and a film/storyboard feature on  the Director's Cut that's interesting.  People upset that the trailer isn't  on the Director's Cut should know that's because when it was a 2 Disc Set  the trailer was put on the Theatrical Disc (which is still available as a  single now).  When I heard a special edition of Army Of Darkness was coming  out I assumed it would be released by Universal Pictures.  Their  Collector's Edition DVD's are very impressive.  I'll even tell you that  when I bought the Anchor Bay version I took it back because I thought it  was defective (it appeared as if their were blemishes on the disc, in fact  every copy I've seen had these blemishes on them) only to find out that  they were all like that.  Anyone defending Anchor Bay should know that  Elite Entertainment released the Special Edition of the first Evil Dead  movie and it looks great.  So if the first film can look that good there's  no excuse why 'Army couldn't recieve the same wonderful treatment,  regardless that it's a bigger movie with more locations, which means more  work creating a decent transfer.  Let me add that Evil Dead 2 is being  rereleased by Anchor Bay as a Special Edition, so lets just hope and pray  they do a better job with Part 2 than they did with Part 3.  Oh, and  Universal, if you're listening, I'm sure I speak for every Army Of Darkness  fan when I say we'd love if you'd release your own Collector's Edition DVD  of this great movie and show the little guy (Anchor Bay) how real Special  Edition's are made.  (&quot;Give Me Some Sugar Baby!&quot;)  5 Stars  for The Universal Pictures DVD  1 Star for The Anchor Bay Versions  (because of the extras)</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Placing tongue firmly in cheek (even more so than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IY48PS">The Evil Dead [Blu-ray</a>]and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J9ZE5I">Evil Dead 2 (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]), "Army of Darkness" remains one of my favorite B-movies combining elements of The Three Stooges, horror flicks, The Marx Brothers, a healthy dose of Monty Python style silliness, the Dark Ages and cheesy movies from the 50's/60's. How could it miss? It has it all--severed body parts, witches that will "swallow your soul", a damsel in distress (who initially hates the hero), a chain saw replacing the hero's severed hand and an evil spirit that will arise if the hero doesn't save the day while saying "Klaatu verada nikto".<br /><br />Ash (Bruce Campbell)the ultimate idiot hero gets sucked through a vortex and ends up in the Dark Ages. Captured by Lord Arthur and believed to be an agent for the Scottish Duke Henry, Ash fights off a creature in the pit (they are being put to death). His only chance to get back is to help reclaim the book Necronomicon Ex-Mortis from a haunted forest. Oh, and there's THREE books to choose from one of which bites and the other has a vortex inside it. When Ash takes the book but forgets to properly say "Klaatu Verada nikto" the army of the dead are released led by Evil Ash. Yep. It's absurd, funny and gross--a very nice combination.<br /><br />The "Screwhead Edition" improves on the DVD edition but you'll see quality as broad as the humor in the film--it varies exceptionally good looking to so-so depending on the use of visuals, etc. Keep in mind this was shot pre-CGI using a variety of visual effects techniques so sometimes its really soft, grainy and sometimes not. The Screwhead Edition is also much brighter than previous, darker DVDs. Which one is right? I dunno but if you're used to the older DVDs prepare for a bit of a shock.<br /><br />Audio sounds pretty good remixed for six channels although it's not going to blow out your windows nor suck you into the vortex.<br /><br />The special features are...a bit underwhelming. There's no commentary track which was one of the delights of the previous editions (which had multiple commentary tracks that were different for each edition as I recall). We get a featurette "The Making of the Deadites" a pretty good retrospective glimpse back into the making of the film featuring the visual effects supervisors.<br /><br />We also get the original (alternate) ending which Raimi was forced to reshoot by Universal executives after a preview as well as the trailer.<br /><br />If you're getting this as an ultimate edition you'll be disappointed but if you can get this inexpensively as an upgrade, I would enjoy it for what it is--a fun, campy flick with Campbell in top form and a nice looking, lighter looking transfer.<br /><br />I'd love to give this edition five stars (hey, I love the film) but Universal originally was going to provide more extras (including commentary tracks). I'm not sure what exactly happened but hopefully we'll eventually see that edition released.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>Originally released in Spring, 1993, ARMY OF DARKNESS only lasted for a week and a half in theaters--not enough to creep into box-office success. After a few years in the back of the shelves, the film has attained "cult status" and had acquired a permanent spot in the books of popular culture. The "Boomstick" Dvd edition has both the 81 minute theatrical cut and the 96 minute director's cut in two discs, both anamorphically enhanced for HDTVs. Sam Raimi`s "Army of Darkness" is one of the most brilliant, campy and awesome Horror-comedies that ever got into my personal collection.<br /><br />The film picks up after the events of Evil Dead 2; Ash (Bruce Campbell) is a hapless house wares clerk is time-warped back to the Dark Ages (or Med-Evil times) by the power of the demonic book "Necronomicon". Now armed only with a `73 Oldsmobile, a chainsaw and a 12-gauge double-barreled S-mart shotgun, our knucklehead hero must battle vicious witches, ghouls, a diabolical doppelganger and the relentless hordes of the evil dead...<br /><br />Raimi's mid-budget, 111 day production time  "Army of Darkness" exudes pure fun entertainment. The film is absolutely hilarious, and is a successful blend of horror elements and satire. The screenplay is full of gems throughout and the dialogue has that very sharp wit. The film has also given birth to some of the most "iconic" scenes in cinema. The windmill scene, the bad-azz vs. good-azz sequence, the cemetery when bones abused Ash in a way that the "Three Stooges" would, acrobatic ghouls that throw punches like Sugar Ray Leonard--the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Accompanied with Raimi's fantastic camerawork which is both inventive and nostalgic, with extreme close-ups and perspective shots that show the stunt-laden scenes, the film is clever and very sharp. The effects in the film is a combination of people in rubber suits, animatronic puppets and stop-motion animation that is definitely campy but none can deny that it fits the film's style--intentionally done with clever "cheesiness". A pathology professor even asked Raimi if he could use his skeletal shots for his lecture. The set designs and cinematography are also quite fitting to its atmosphere that almost looks like a comic book. (no wonder Raimi was so successful in Spider-man 1 and 2) The Matte paintings and studio sets are so campy that it adds to its own humorous genius.<br /><br />The film is action-packed and full of stunts and explosions. The assault on the castle and the battle between science and magic is so much fun to watch. What is also so clever is that it effectively blends humorous dialogue and the action. While some films use dialogue and camp to delay a film's proceedings, this film definitely uses every bit of its nicely placed humor as character development. Now, the film does have its share of goofs in the screenplay when Ash went to retrieve the Necronomicon, but the film is just so much fun that you'll more than likely to not notice.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell does an outstanding job as with the supporting cast. Campbell is very charismatic as our awkward hero and should be credited with certain unforgettable catch phrases such as "Give me some sugar, Baby.." and "Groovy". The dialogue is just brilliant, full of humorous one-liners delivered by Campbell. The guy is definitely the right actor for the job as he does show enough witty attitude to keep the audience entertained. The cast is definitely having fun with this film and I do think there were times that Sam Raimi probably let them loose to act as they wished. Of course, no film of this nature would be complete without a beautiful leading lady. Embeth Davidtz has that classic leading lady look and fit's the role of Sheila.<br /><br />The director's cut has more than 15 minutes of additional footage. The extended cut has subtle bits of added action, dialogue and the famous (or infamous?) alternate apocalyptic ending. The additional scenes can be spotted because the scenes do have more grain than the others. I personally like the director's cut better although the theatrical cut may have more inherent "coolness" and faster-paced.<br /><br />ARMY OF DARKNESS is one of those films that should be a part of any film fan's movie library.<br />The movie is just so much fun to watch. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and give it a spin. The film is just loads of fun to watch and has near-infinite replay value.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! [4 ? - Stars]</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Your enjoyment of "Army of Darkness" is not totally dependent on seeing the "Evil Dead" films first but it does help.  This film takes something of a departure from the first films in attempting to mainstream the series.  It is more humorous and it is virtually bloodless.  It is also interesting that director Sam Raimi took the series into a time-travel vein.  The action scenes and special effects are terrific.  This film is played for macabre humor as opposed to outright horror.  Star Bruce Campbell just continues to amaze as the series progresses.  He had already proven himself as a comic force in "Evil Dead II" and here he expands himself as an action star something akin to an Errol Flynn or a Harrison Ford.  If you want to wean the squeamish on the series start with this film and go backward.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>A smart-alecky, average joe named Ash, after losing his girlfriend and his right-hand fighting demons in a cabin in the woods, gets spat out of a portal through time and lands smack dab in the dark ages, where two warring kingdoms also struggle with an invading force of pure evil gradually taking possession. They are the ancient ones, and only the chosen one has the power to defeat them. That chosen one, of course, is chainsaw armed, shotgun wielding Ash, AKA Bruce Campbell, vs. the Army of Darkness.<br /><br />Basically, this movie is pure awesomeness! I can still remember the first time I saw it. I luckily had become an Evil Dead fan in a few years earlier thanks to late night airings on the A&E network back when cable TV was much cooler (okay, well, you do have stuff like Walking Dead now, but also about ten million reality shows). However, I had no idea there was a third one being made, and when I went to see Army of Darkness with a friend in 1992, I really didn't realize what it was I was sitting down to see. Then, I saw the prologue. It was Evil Dead 3! And yet, this movie was sooo much more than the Evil Dead films! Okay, it wasn't scary like those ones were (well, they were to me as a kid watching them alone in the dark in the middle of the night), it was more funny. Army of Darkness is definitely more of an action/adventure/comedy than a horror film, though it still shares enough of the look, feel, and even scenarios of the previous two installments to work as a true part 3. And Bruce has really come into his own here, far beyond anything he was in the previous two films. He is the ultimate sarcastic anti-hero with the coolest gear and the best catch phrases! "Army of Darkness" is one of the best, funniest fantasy horror films you're ever gonna find, so make sure you check this one out! You'll see why so many people were excited to see Bruce in each of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. Yes, if you didn't know, Sam Raimi got his start with the Evil Dead trilogy!<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray, well,... some scenes look pretty bad, and this thing is pretty weak on bonus features. I hadn't gotten this on DVD (I had it on VHS forever though), so I was thrilled to get the Blu-Ray, but this "Screwhead Edition" definitely leaves a lot to be desired since there aren't many bonus features either. You get the alternate ending, which is hilarious, but I'm glad it wasn't the ending they used, and you get a featurettes that is mostly about the monster effects. It's pretty cool. But, that's it. Seriously? The Evil Dead movies had better bonus features. Maybe you're supposed to focus on the U-Control and BD-Live enhancements, but while I love bonus features, I don't bother with that stuff, just like I never used to bother with CD-ROM bonus features. Maybe if I had a wifi router, but right now I don't. Anyways, still a must-own movie, so I highly recommend picking this up. It will always been one of my favorites! I even dressed up as Ash for Halloween once, and I hope to do it again in the future (and maybe for some cons)!</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>What a riot this movie is.  When I'm feeling the need for a popcorn and beer nuts lollapalooza movie night, I pull out "Army of Darkness" and invite over my demented friends, neighbors and family for a good laugh.<br /><br />Groovy Bruce is at his kookiest best as Ash, Housewares, S-Mart, battling the Deadites and trying to stay alive in the 1300s, after dropping into the past with his beat up Oldsmobile, his chainsaw prosthesis hand and his Remington shotgun.<br /><br />He fights skeletons carrying swords, saves himself with his chainsaw hand, has a whirlwind romance with Sheila, played by Embeth Davidtz, and just generally drops some of the funniest one-liners ever and works on creating gallons of blood and guts.<br /><br />Looking for a movie that will bring a grin (albeit deranged) to your face? This is it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I never thought that Sam Raimi could possibly do anything crazier than EVIL DEAD 2. I was wrong. ARMY OF DARKNESS is the perfect horror-comedy, w/ an unleashed and unhinged Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. AOD is an overdose of non-stop hilarity and insane slapstick. Campbell has never matched his wild performance here. Almost every line he utters is quotable! His feel for physical comedy is sublime. Watch as Ash takes one flogging after another, battling demons, zombie doppelgangers, and a skeleton army! If you like a bit of madness in your horror, you can't do any better than this classic...</p></br></body></html>

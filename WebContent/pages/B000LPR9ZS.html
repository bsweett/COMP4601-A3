Here's a movie that relies more on intelligence than gore. Although there is plenty of that. And some of the torture scenes are so imaginative that it's way more entertaining than gruesome. The 3 movies together make for some of the best in horror movie history.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>With Jigsaw debilitated and near death, it falls to his new protege to carry on the infamous 'games' in "Saw III", the most recent entry in one of the 2000s's best ongoing series.  Knowing nothing of any apprentice, the detectives who've been pursuing the Jigsaw killer since the first chapter in the series are mystified by the continuing killings.<br /><br />  "Saw III" ties elements from its two predecessors in with new ideas and a new direction expertly, creating a movie that enhances both of the films that came before it (which were already excellent).  The ongoing story has become deeper and more multi-faceted while losing nothing of the horror and tension that initially catapulted the concept to greatness.  The new protege abducts a doctor whose own life now depends on her ability to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to see the outcome of the latest, most complex - and most psychologically interesting - of the deathtrap-oriented games.  The character of Jigsaw is explored more deeply in this one - for the first time it feels like his rationale of 'teaching the value of being alive' by bringing the victims who survive so close to death, may actually be something more than a contrived excuse for a psychopath to reign in terror and pain.  For the first time the character, despite the depravity of his actions throughout the series, comes off as being possibly something other than nothing but plain evil, comes off as a twisted but mentally complex individual who may somehow believe his own words, and that his games - in his own warped psyche - have more to them than gratuitous sadism.  He even appears capable of sympathizing with his victims.  This is not a plot roundabout to just take a villain who became immensely popular and 'turn him good', it's part of an an ongoing evolution of what's being revealed about the characters (as of this entry there are now a fair number who have appeared in two or more of the movies).  The characterization of Jigsaw's apprentice is also very developed here, but harder to reference directly without risking spoilers; and the doctor - who despite her dangerous situation seems consumed more by a desire to save her patient regardless of who or what he is - is an excellent addition to the roster of players.  And as for the infamous games themselves, nothing of the shock, nothing of the savagery, nothing of the intensity has been sacrificed to make room for expanded insight into the characters.  Indeed, the twists and revelations - and questions - spinning out of this latest round of the games may be the most gripping of the trilogy.<br /><br />"Saw III" just might be the best of the saga to date; one of 2006's most indispensable horror movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe, after watching this third installment in the uber-gory Saw series, that a fourth is in the making. This is not because the movies are running out of ideas (the twists, although expected, still have some creative bite to them) or because they are lacking a certain gruesome appeal (the films have a faithful fan base that has made the movies a Halloween tradition). Instead, it's because the makers of this third flick, by the last frame, appear to have painted themselves into a corner with a bucket of pig guts and brain juice.<br /><br />But, if there's one thing the Saw movies have to teach us (and they go out of their way to pretend that they have a lot of teaching to do), it's that appearances can be deceiving. This lesson I believe. The rest of Saw's lecturing, well, it's hard to listen to a sermon when the pastor is ripping your arm off.<br /><br />All of the usual suspects are back this time around, with Jigsaw (a pale-as-rainwater Tobin Bell) and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), providing us with yet another meticulously macabre experiment in death and personal redemption. This time the primary subjects are Jeff (a man subsumed by grief for his son, Dylan, killed by a hit-and-run driver) and Lynn (an ER doctor who is addicted to pain killers and her own ennui). Jeff is given the opportunity, in a series of tests, to watch those responsible for his son's demise (a witness, a judge, the driver himself) meet their maker. Or, if he chooses the moral high ground, Jeff can save them. Lynn, meanwhile, has a much easier task: keep the dying Jigsaw alive long enough to watch this last game play out. If Jigsaw's heart stops beating, so does hers.<br /><br />How Jeff and Lynn are connected is anyone's guess (and your first one will probably be right), but, as per usual, the film still has a few bloody aces up its sleeve. Shot in a line-up of primary colors (each scene has its own color schema) and grittily textured, it's the most visceral Saw, yet. Thankfully it doesn't trade (too much) of its brains for blood; just as the second film capitalized on elements of the first, this third covers the bases in all of them and -- if you watch close enough -- does, in fact, set up a few questions to be answered in a fourth.<br /><br />Some might not be interested in questions like these, though. Although the franchise hasn't really lost its edge, it does appear to be losing steam. Each Saw is staged, in some way, as a morality play, with people trapped inside their own brand of sick salvation. The first movie was both inventive and focused. The second widened its aim and, as such, missed a few targets. This third film, with its ever-more-intricate web of wicked wisdom, almost collapses under its own weight. Here's hoping that the next Saw tries to cut out its Deeper Message with a chainsaw, instead of a finely-edged scalpel.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>I did not think that they could do better than Saw 2, so was I in for a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Everything has gotten better with saw, and this time they have truly outdone themselves. The plot is better, and there is more of everything than in 1 or 2.<br /><br />More blood, more traps, more characters and storylines..just more of everything.<br /><br />Also there seem to be a lot more twists and turns in this one.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about it , is that it picked up right where Saw 2 left off, as Amanda in closing the door on the cop.<br /><br />This movie is so good, and so full of surprises, that I can't say anymore or it will spoil it. I will only say that Jigsaw is still alive in this movie, not dead dead like I thought from Saw 2.<br /><br />This would be very hard to top if they decide to make a Saw 4 !</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Having avoided watching Saw 2 for six years I finally decided to be brave and see if it was any good. While some elements were memorable it was a disappointing experience for me. Undeterred I moved onto Saw 3 and promised myself I would give it a chance. I stuck to my word and, goodness me, what an experience it was!<br /><br />Saw 3 follows on directly from its predecessor, tying up some loose ends, notably with Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) who all end up victims of Jigsaw's sadistic games. The film then switches its focus to Jigsaw's latest game. With his apprentice, Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), in tow, Jigsaw has her kidnap Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) with instructions that she must keep the bedridden Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) alive for the duration of the latest game or be killed by the intimidating collar round her neck which will fire shotgun bullets into her head! The game Jigsaw devises sees Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a father seeking vengeance for the death of his son, given the chance to face the man that killed his son, but only by completing some tests along the way. The question is can Jeff complete the game and will Lynn Denlon keep Jigsaw alive until he does?<br /><br />The main focus of the film has Jeff face the only witness to his son's death who refused to testify in court and the judge that allowed the drunk driver off lightly. Jigsaw's test for Jeff is whether he can forgive those that contributed to his grief and desire for vengeance in the present. Though Jeff is an understandably emotional and grief-stricken father he is also a bit slow when it comes to playing Jigsaw's games. No sooner has he met these faces from his past than Jigsaw's games begin with Jeff given a strict time limit before the victims are killed. Not only does he have to decide whether to forgive them, their lives are also in his hands! I was bemused at Jeff's procrastination tactics which meant even if he decided to help a victim it was already too late!<br /><br />Saw 2 upped the gore on the original and Saw 3 takes it even further. In the opening section we have the police investigating another victim of Jigsaw's who woke in a room to find numerous chains attached to his body and his only means of escape is to rip them out one by one before a bomb explodes. The opening does clear up some unanswered questions from the last film and propels Jigsaw's apprentice, Amanda, to the forefront of the story. Though she seems to house Jigsaw's meticulousness and ruthlessness in putting together the many games, there is vulnerability about Amanda that begins to have negative impacts as Saw 3 reaches its conclusion.<br /><br />Rather than gripped by Saw 3 I was left rolling my eyes and shaking my head. Jeff's story wasn't remotely engaging and even though another twist was waiting at the end it had no impact compared to the original film and, dare I say, Saw 2. The other major complaint is that writers James Wan and Leigh Whannell, who collaborated on the first film but only Whannell on the second, felt the need to reveal not only Amanda's compassion towards Jigsaw's victims but also that she helped him set up the game that takes centre stage in the original Saw, which I felt tainted the first film rather than make me want to go back and link it to the revelations in Saw 3. The first film worked so well by demonstrating the power Jigsaw had over his victims despite his debilitating illness. Even the ending to Saw, brilliantly chilling, is now somewhat redundant thanks to Saw 3.<br /><br />While I had major issues with Saw 2 it did have some good elements. Sadly I cannot say the same of Saw 3 which although gorier, lacks in a decent plot and the need to revisit events from the first film suggests a lack of ideas to me rather than ingenuity. Saw was, and still is, a great film but Saw 3 will make my next viewing of it not as pleasurable as previously, something I never thought I would say.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>If you are  a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to see this movie because it answers a lot of things about the first movie. It gives Amanda a lot of backstory, including how and why she really became an apprentice of Jigsaw. There are a lot of scenes that will make you squirm in the film, worse things than what they have shown in the previous two films. The written is still engaging and it is easy to be sucked into the story as you watch every twisted thing that is done to the victims. After the movie ended, I got the feeling that Jigsaw wasn't so bad and I was able to understand why he does what he does. There is almost an empathy to Jigsaw when it shows more of his past as well. Overall, this is a movie that should end the trilogy and not have a fourth movie. I hear rumors of a fourth movie in the works, but the perfect ending is with this movie</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I've seen all the Saw movies and this one is much like the first 2, but with more gore and less suspense or mystery.  So I would have to say this was the least interesting of the three.  But the movie provides closure, I just hope they don't make another-not sure what is left to tell.  This was the first Blu Ray disc I watched on my PS3.  I also own the Toshiba A1 HD DVD player so I've seen a lot of high def movies.  As with most high def movies, the picture was very sharp and saturated in brighter scenes.  In darker scenes, the picture was more noisy and looked like regular DVD.  But I have seen this on all high def movies so I don't think Saw 3 was a bad transfer.  If you liked the first 2, then you'll probably like this one too.</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>Saw II is that rare horror movie that is just as good if not better than the original.  Depending on what you thought of Saw, Saw II looks to be about as demented, and makes about as much sense as Saw.<br /><br />The film opens with another hapless fool waking up in another music-video-leftover room with another insane device attached to his head.  The serial killer Jigsaw (who has never killed anyone) informs him via video that he has about a minute to cut out his eyeball to retrieve a key to unlock the venus-flytrap device on his head.  Argh!  From there we are introduced to a weary cop with family troubles who is being personally called out by Jigsaw.  Before long, we find out that Jigsaw has kidnapped his son, along with a bunch of other idiots and placed them in a booby trapped house with poison gas being pumped through the vents and a time limit for them to endure sick, twisted, horror-movie-traps and tests in order to prove how badly they want to live.<br /><br />Don't think too closely about this one, as by the end it makes even less sense than the twist of the original.  And yes, there is a twist of sorts.  The movie looks like the original, meaning it looks like a Nine Inch Nails video and has all the editing of the ADD school of filmmaking which is now apparently a pre-req for making at least 50% of movies.  The ridiculous editing is getting out of hand now---why do they feel the need to TELL you visually that it's time to get tense, or scared?  Are the filmmakers too uneasy about the material and their ability to just rely on the situation, the script, the actors?  Do I need to see crack head editing and lights and that over-produced dirt and grime in every movie in order to feel anything?<br /><br />These movies are not scary in the least, masking a lack of imagination in the horror/fear department, but plenty of imagination in the 'how else can they die' department.  Cruelty and tastelessness are the new horror genre checkpoints, I guess it's a lot easier than creating genuine scares or fear.  How about babies in a blender, that'd be a good horror flick.  These films can be demented fun for 90 minutes and can be a lot of fun in a crowded movie theater, but they're overdone and over-stylized.  The visuals don't show you as much as tell you (with the same lighting, editing, colors) that this is a horror film.  The moral 'message' of the killer, or the writers, is perhaps the real reason this is a horror film.<br /><br />Plenty of extras about the making of the film and the traps, all the work that goes into this madness, new ways to torture and kill people, and other wonders.  It's always nice to see that artistic, creative people can make a living designing torture contraptions for fictitious serial killers (fictitious today, that is), and that those serial killers become 'beloved' characters to American audiences.  There's a 2 DVD set out there as well, though this single disc unrated widescreen edition should suffice for most folks.  I would bet the house that Saw becomes a video game or a series of them, the possibilities for interactive sadism are too much for them not to hybridize Saw.<br /><br />Followed by Saw III.  And IV.  Box set coming...</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Many films lose steam by the third installment - but not SAW III.  The script is as tight as the first two installments, and the gore even better!  John is back, with sidekick Amanda, and new victims are set up for deadly misadventures.<br /><br />John kidnaps a doctor to take care of his cancer, linking her by a collar to his heartrate.  If he dies, she dies.  Meanwhile, a new victim must fight his way out of a maze compromised of other victims, victims who were indirectly or directly responsible for killing his son in a car accident.  Think pig guts!!  Amanda has some new colors to show.  Let the games begin.<br /><br />What great traps we have here!  Any horror or gore fan is going to absolutely love the pig-guts vat (nasty!), but we have chest-rippers, ice showers (close the door, its cold in there), "The Rack" (John's admitted favorite), explosive collars, and shotgun tubes.<br /><br />This movie is a "Do not miss!" for any horror aficionado, but if gore makes you queasy, you'd best stay away.  For the true horror fan, if you put butter on your popcorn, throw a little red dye into the melted butter for that added sicko effect, and ENJOY this 10 star gore fest!</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>I know it's just a movie, but I find it hard to believe most of the things in this movie could actually take place.  How could Amanda carry all her victims to their demise - How could she kidnap many of them in broad daylight - Who builds, maintains, and gets materials for all of the machines - how can Jigsaw install cameras in peoples' homes and also know everything about them? Amanda stated she built the shotgun bullet trap - yeah, sure.  Everything seems to work out perfectly and timed.  The husband must have a very low IQ as he is so slow to save any of the victims, by the time he does anything, they are dead, often standing there like an idiot for some time.  His wife is dying on the floor and he takes his sweet time to do anything.  Why couldn't she warn him that killing Jigsaw would result in her death? Many things happen in this movie that are scripted badly just so the story can come together in a neat little package.  P.S. I didn't know that getting your face smashed against a concrete wall 3 or more times is no big deal.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Saw III -Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>What was great about the original Saw, was that there was a great twist ending and the gore was hinted at, not really graphic, leaving the viewer to conjure up the worst in their imagination. This was a similar tactic used in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, what was not seen seemed so much worse. With Saw 2, things took a little more graphic turn, there was still a nice twist ending, and the story wasn't as heavy handed, there was a "fun" element to the story. Saw 3 cranks up the gore, and slaps the viewer with a heavy, very melancholy storyline. Saw 3 is so depressive, there is really no one to cheer for, you really don't care who lives or dies as there is really no character development, and the two new main characters/victims are so unlikable you begin to lose interest. While I agree Saw 3 wraps up loose ends from Saw 2, it ends up presenting so many new questions that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Now you will have to see part 4 when it comes out to see how the storyline of part 3 wraps up. I don't care any longer, I am done playing Jigsaw's game. Unless your idea of entertainment is seeing broken bones being pushed through the skin, or toolbox brain surgery, stay away from this bloody mess of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>"Saw III" should have been the epic, horrifying end to this demented series; unfortunately, it wasn't epic and it probably isn't the end of the series at all.<br /><br />The reason I enjoyed the first film was not the gore, although I have to admit I was impressed by the openly brutal scenario of people having to hack their own legs off in order to survive (one either overcomes the fear of horrendous physical pain or dies), but because it had a soul and a brain behind it: an atmosphere of mystery and horror pervaded it.  No one knew who was the vicious mastermind behind these inventive and repugnant torture/murders or who would go to such lengths to prove something to society about the depreciation of life. Saw II" carried on in a similar vein; more was revealed about Jigsaw and he was face to face with an angry cop who wanted his son back.  Still, we didn't know anything about him and it never became too personal; he remained a ghastly enigma with an intriguingly intelligent and thoroughly evil persona.<br /><br />In this movie, though, they make the character that could have rivalled Hannibal Lecter into a soap opera.  The film begins promisingly (an ex-con gets permanently reformed in a rather unorthodox way) and Jigsaw, ironically, has to face his own mortality through his imminent death by cancer.  From there it degenerates into tedious emotional dynamics involving his protege Amanda, a young doctor with a time operated shotgun shell collar around her neck, and plays an extended and really ridiculous "game" with a blameless victim of a drunk driver.<br /><br />The character Jeff and his "vengeance conflict" (how can you blame the guy for not wanting to save the guy who ran over his child?) is really just an excuse for us to watch Jigsaw's demented assistant indulge in emotional drama about her checkered and boring past.  Things get so monotonous that nothing shocks anymore.  The end is the most ridiculous plot twist I've ever seen and it isn't enduring what precedes it.  If they were going to do this, they should have ended the series with the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Saw III (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2006)<br /><br />Well, the good news is that James Wan returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. The bad news is that James Wan only returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. Wan, who also directed the first film, created one of the enduring horror movies of the decade so far; Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the second film in the franchise, turned in what was, at best, just another cheesy survival thriller that lacked any echo of the characterization, complexity, and finesse that made the first one so good. Guess who directs Saw III?<br /><br />I'm sure you've seen at least one sitcom episode where there's a loose frame story that exists for the sole purpose of replaying amusing scenes from earlier in the season. That's, in part, the direction Saw III takes-- there's a lot of flashback footage in this movie. Which is really kind of depressing, because Wan came up with a real barnburner of a story idea here-- Jigsaw (Tobin Bell, reprising his role) and his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith, reprising hers) are the focus here. They've kidnapped Lynn (Crash's Bahar Soomekh), a doctor with marital problems, to keep Jigsaw alive during his final game, one in which Jeff (Titus' Angus McFadyen) must forgive the driver who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident, as well as a number of others who, directly or indirectly, contributed to his son's death. Jeff's game, however, is almost a background here, as the focus remains on Lynn, Amanda, and Jigsaw. And, of course, there's an awesome twist ending (with the most blatant "if you're not paying attention, you'll miss it" clue since Profondo Rosso) that leads us straight into Saw IV. And had Wan's idea been perfectly translated, I have no doubt this would have been an excellent movie, easily the equal of the first one.<br /><br />"Perfectly translated," however, it is not. It has once again gone through the blender that is Leigh Whannell, but again without Wan's butt in the director's chair mitigating Whannell's inability to characterize. We see an even worse flaw of Whannell's in the opening scenes of Saw III: Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Donnie Wahlberg's characters, all of whom survived Saw II, appear in the movie's opening scenes and are eliminated for no reason. (Well, there's a reason, but it's a desperately flimsy one that's obviously the thinnest of layers over "hey, we have cool devices and nowhere else in the movie to use them.") While the movie's better than its predecessor, "better" is something of a relative term. It's certainly not the equal of the first film, but it doesn't quite have the "let's trample all over the legacy of the first film" feel to it that the second one does. Watchable, at least. **</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>I think many of us agree that the first one is still the best.  I must admit Saw III has many gross bloody moments with great torture devices but it was so rushed to get to the end that they forgot to let us get to know any of the characters.  These movies have made enough money to get some better known actors haven't they?  Perhaps familiar faces would help the audience connect to the characters more.  Or better writing too.  In Saw III we get what is expected.  More games, more sick twisted scenes, and we also get a surprise at the end of the movie that for me was worth giving the film four stars.  Overall I am satisfied with how this third installment tied all three movies together especially with the two lead charcters Jigsaw and Amanda.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Saw III is probably considered a bloody mess and this sequel does tend to drip on the sloppy side, but Saw III still pulls off another fascintating, twist ending. No big names in this one, just the return of Jigsaw and his apprentice, Amanda. Some of the graphic and brutal tortue scenes are kind of silly but I always liked to story behind as to why these individulas don't appreciate their lives (Jigsaw has an obsession of people who don't feel grateful). This sequel doesn't compare to the original or even Saw II, but if you want to know how this baby ends then indulge yourself in a little game of cat and mouse. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This is a very different Saw than the other 2 previous ones. I liked this one because it was a totally different scenario. Yes, it was still gruesome and gorey but the story was a different one. If you are a fan of the Saw trilogies, then see this one. If you are not, then see another horror flick. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes the Saw trilogies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>It never fails. If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. First of all, I wasn't crazy about the first "Saw", but "Saw 2" was really good, and most importantly for me the 2 tied in together. I hate it when they make a sequel and it has absolutely nothing to do with the first film. Not to say that this movie has nothing to do with the first 2 films, I'm just merely stating that I hate when they make movies like that in general. Anyway, deep down inside I knew this would stink, I guess I was just curious, and I had a little extra cash to splurge. Anyone who is familiar with the "Saw" movies know that you can expect a huge twist at the end. However, in this film, the end is where it fell flat. I guess if you like endings where everybody dies, and nothing is solved, then you'll like this. I felt like it was sort of cliffhangerish (if that's even a word). I don't see how there can be another sequel, but we all know they'll find a way even if it's a copycat to carry on the Jigsaw's work. At any rate, I think another sequel is pretty much a guarantee. This movie is just meaningless gore and unecessary violence with a horrible ending that managed to destroy the first 2 movies for me. American filmakers need to understand that you can't rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace  the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some of the concepts though. I do think it was pretty sick to do brain sugery on someone with power tools while their still awake. That was a good scene for me, but that's about it. Needless to say, don't waste your time waiting on the big payoff because you'll be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Tobin Bell returns as the diabolical "Jigsaw" in this excellent 3rd installment of the now-famous "Saw" series.  This movie picks up right where part II left off.  We see Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) slamming the door on a well and truly trapped Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg).  "Game's over", she mutters as she leaves.  But is the game over for Matthews?  It is for one other part II carryover; Kerry (Dina Meyer).  She is investigating the death of a former ex-con who has died in a most brutal manner.  At first, she doesn't expect Jigsaw was involved, but she soon learns otherwise as the video retrieved from the crime scene shows.<br /><br />Soon, Kerry is abducted by Amanda and she meets the same gruesome demise as the crime scene victims she used to investigate.  But the real story follows .<br /><br />There are two story lines in this movie.  One deals with Jigsaw's worsening brain tumor.  Realizing his condition is deterorating, he instructs Amanda to abduct Lynn (Bakar Soomekh), a successful surgeon, to help with his condition.  Upset with her life situation, Lynn is apparently just going through the motions at her job.  Amanda abducts her and leads her to Jigsaw, where she is fitted with an explosive collar designed to detonate if Jigsaw "flatlines".  She is forced to keep Jigsaw alive or risk her own death.<br /><br />The other plot deals with a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen).  Jeff's young son was killed by a drunk driver, and he has been dealing with feelings of revenge.  Captured by Jigsaw and placed in a box, he is released and able to confront those responsible for the death of his son; the lone eyewitness, the leniant judge, and the driver himself.  He has the choice of saving each of these people or letting them die.  Will Jeff choose life or death?  Will he be able to overcome his feelings of rage and save these people, or will they die like so many other of Jigsaw's victims?<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the final 15 minutes.  In this time, all of the questions and twists of the movie are neatly wrapped up.  Watch closely so you don't miss anything.<br /><br />I found this movie to be the best of the "Saw" movies by far.  Tobin Bell does a magnificent job as the maniachal Jigsaw, and the other actors are very good as well.  What sets this movie apart from the first two is its excellent plot.  It will keep you guessing throughout until everything is revealed at the end.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The "Saw" series has become one of the biggest horror movie series in recent memory, and this thrilling and bloody installment maintains the earlier tradition.  The scenes in this movie are much more graphic than in the first two movies, so watch with caution.  This series has become one of my favorites, and "Saw III" keeps the action and blood flowing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>jigsaw is up to his tricks again....or is he ?!?!?!?!? without giving away any secrets,lets just say hes not quite dead yet.<br /><br />last we seen of jigs,he led eric matthews to ''the house'' after recieving huge beating.matthews (d whalburg) thought that his son from part 2 was trapped there.of course he wasnt and turns out that HE became the next test subject.he awakens chained at the ankle.we also find out jigs has an apprentice.<br /><br />ok,next verse,same as the first.....two;unappreciative humans put to the untimate test~live or die !!!<br /><br />test subject #2- spanish dude chained at the most painful of areas (most notably his achilles tendons and through the bottom of his mouth !!!! if he can break away from his chains before bomb goes off,he survives.or does he ????<br /><br />test subject #3- detective whatsherface (dina meyer) is whisked away from her apt only to find herself in some crazy contraption.if shes able to get key from yonder jar of acid,she can free herself.....or can she ???<br /><br />test subject #4- a nurse is lead to jigs.her mission is to keep him alive long enough to see test subject #5 complete his test.she is bound to do so by a bomb collar.if she strays to far or if he flatlines....KABOOM !!(theres a scene where jigs has his skull sawed open...it could have done better)<br /><br />and finally,and most importantly,test subject #5- angus mcfadyen is a grieving father of a son who got killed by a car.it is he who is put through the rigors.he is put face to face to those responsible in some way for his sons death,ultimately to the person who commited the act.<br /><br />the opening and closing scenes (whalburg  chained at ankle and black dude in some bone twisting machine) has to be the most gut wrenching scenes ive seen in a longassed while !!!!! of course its outlandish,plucking people and setting them up in the most crazy traps....who complained about jason having super human strength just because he possibly drowned ?!?!?!?! just go with it,willya ?!?!?!?<br /><br />i liked this one more than 2 but not as much as 1.i hope i didnt give anything away in this review,however,the way this ended,part 4 isnt completely out of the question.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>SAW III goes for the jugular, and it succeeds in being repulsively fascinating in its expectedly perverse manner.  The most disturbing scene is not one of Jigsaw's many games, though---it's the operation performed on his brain to remove a piece of his skull to prevent him from dying.  It's pretty gruesome to say the least.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the writers seem to be trying to turn Jigsaw into some kind of mercy-seeking angel, trying to somehow justify his horrifying acts.  Sorry, folks...Jigsaw is pure evil, sociopathically immoral, and immune to the immense acts of torture he orchestrates with the assistance of his demented slave, well played by Shawnee Smith.  Tobin Bell is effective as Jigsaw, considering most of his time is spent in a hospital bed.  There are some horrifying acts of sadistic torture, and some good acting from Angus Macfayden as the man whose revenge leads him down a fatal path.  Bahar Soomekh is also effective as the doctor recruited to perform the operation on Jigsaw, or die herself.  Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyers return from SAW II, but they are merely torture objects in this one.<br /><br />SAW has had its moments, but the trilogy should stop now; it's focusing more on gore and shock than storylines, and even though you wouldn't think so, it does leave a door open for another sequel.  Do us a favor...stop while you're reasonably ahead.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"SAW III" or the entire "SAW" franchise for that matter has already been known as one of the goriest horror/suspense series (except, probably "Hostel" and some of Miike's films), so I expected what I would see from the beginning. Frankly I didn't care the amount of blood or violence, but when the story seems to be repeating itself, there must be a problem. Actually some part of "SAW III" is only repeating what we already know in the previous two films (though it is told from a different perspective with flashbacks).<br /><br />But what is most disappointing for me is that in "SAW III" the intriguing relations between Jigsaw and one character (you know who) are not fully developed. The filmmakers, it seems, spent most of energy to set up various methods of tortures, which is fine, I admit, but they could have created something more interesting out of the master-pupil-like relations between them with more subdued approach and less swearing.<br /><br />I also find the film shows its hand too early. During the film's story, we only wait for the next "challenge" to start and the results are now fairly predictable. (Remember the first "SAW" of which script showed some intelligence even in the gory trap scenes). And if Jigsaw is terminally ill, how did he manage to set up such elaborated torture machines?<br /><br />The only scene I was interested is the brief moment where Jigsaw's past is suggested. After all it is him and his eccentric personality that has made "SAW" a cut above other slasher films. Let's see what happens next in the forthcoming fourth installment because considering how "SAW III" wraps up, to continue the plot after that would be the hardest part of the entire series.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>This film is stupid.

One is a female doctor who is having an affair on her husband and the other is a man who hasn't come to terms with the death of his young son. Who was the victim of a car accident at the hands of a drunk driver. But the two of them will have to figure out their connection to one another, to survive Jigsaw's game and to make matters worse.

Yes, it's utterly relentless and gory, I saw people covering their eyes with hands in a theater, even I winced a couple of times although I had seen many of the films alike. But what I liked the most here was not the brutal nature of Saw III (and it's quite important for the fans when a movie lives up to its R-rating, so that they can say money was spent wisely) and not even the intricate story-line that keeps you surprised and on the edge of your seat all the time. Not the final twist which was expected of course but surely you didn't know what it would be exactly.<br /><br />The main merit of the third part is that it doesn't appear to be a usual stupid sequel that lacks ideas, it brings some new sense into the series, glues all the three films together making a perfect trilogy out of it which now can be watched as a one big 5-hour film. There's plenty of flashbacks here that explain a lot from the second and even the first part, and some things become clear that were not in the ends of previous series. It really takes talent to make a movie that not just stands alone, but adds a lot to the other parts and completes them. Guys that were making it are true professionals and real maniacs :)<br /><br />And apart from being as it seems overly gory and graphic Saw III can boast of being rather thoughtful too. The evil genius of Jigsaw (and of the makers of the film) made the characters (and us along with them) think about rage and its manifestations, about revenge and people's insatiable urge to punish those who took their beloved ones. By quite simple examples inclusive of flesh-ripping, bone-crushing, joint-wresting etc. the killer himself shows us killing is bad. Those will survive who don't succumb to the desire of payback. Only forgiving can grant forgiveness for ourselves. And that's the rule for everyone, even for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken. Otherwise death awaits you as well as your victims. In this movie Jigsaw is seen not as an ordinary killer maniac, but as some kind of a teacher if you will. So this time his puzzles must be solved not only using strength, keen wit and will to live, but also by testing your own virtue and that's something new for this kind of flicks, don't you agree?<br /><br />I don't know what they will do with Saw IV, because the third part wrapped it all very nice making a perfectly neat structure of a trilogy.

I had seen each of the first three movies in the franchise when they were initially released to DVD, and had developed opinions both good and bad for each of the films at the time. For instance, when I watched the first film, "Saw", I really didn't think all that much for the movie, I thought it was alright but not worth all the hype it had received. Then I watched "Saw 2" and felt it was a much better movie than the original, I thought the story was improved, and didn't borrow as heavily from other influences. After that I watched "Saw 3", but I hadn't seen the first two in so long that I thought the third film contradicted certain elements contained in the first two, and was also much gorier and seemingly short on plot. However, after re-watching each of the movies in the franchise back-to-back my opinions have somewhat changed. I actually found myself liking the original film much better the second time around, and found "Saw 2" to be fairly disappointing by comparison, due to a lack of character development and an over-reliance on shock and gore, instead of developing an eerily creepy atmosphere and a story that would deliver genuine thrills as the original film had done. Which brings me to my re-watching of the third film in the series, "Saw 3". Going into this film I wondered if my opinion would change as drastically as it had on the previous two films or if it would remain essentially the same as it was after the first time I watched the movie. Either way, I was curious to see what results awaited my repeat viewing of the film that I felt was the weakest in the series thus far.<br /><br />"Saw 3" picks up immediately after the events of "Saw 2", and we find Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) desperately trying to free himself in order to save his son. However, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) isn't as fair as Jigsaw and has no intention of allowing Eric to escape. After their brutal altercation (essentially tying off the dangling loose ends left over from the previous film), Amanda joins her mentor, the ailing Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), in overseeing their latest series of tests, one involves a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) who is extremely talented and caring in the operating room yet is cold and aloof to her family at home. The second test focuses on a heartbroken father (Angus MacFadyen) who has lost his son in an automobile accident and would give anything to exact vengeance on those he holds responsible. As each of the subjects advance through their own series of tests, Jigsaw's already deteriorating health seems to be declining at an increasingly rapid rate, but this will not deter the maniacal mastermind from seeing his carefully designed plans come to fruition.<br /><br />When I watched "Saw 3" for the first time after it had recently arrived on DVD in early 2007, I initially found the film to be just another standard horror film that was intent on using as much blood and gore as the MPAA would allow in a film. Basically the filmmakers wanted to see just how much they could get away with before the audience was completely disgusted. The traps had seemed more grotesque, and were even more inescapable than those in the previous two films (which it turned out was the case due to Amanda's refusal to give her victims a chance at life, a fact that was shown in several flashbacks throughout the movie), and the results of the traps were even more bizarre and horrifying than what either of the first two films had attempted. Also, I had thought that the story for "Saw 3" contradicted certain events of the previous two movies, especially the first movie, and a couple of moments in the second, leaving me wondering why the writers of this installment, James Wan and Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the first film together), would contradict their own work from the original movie.<br /><br />Well, after finishing "Saw 3" for the second time I must say that my opinion of the film has changed in some instances. I found that the story, which I initially found contradictory, was very well put together and was not contradictory in the least. The story also felt more in sync with the tone of the original film, by having Jigsaw and Amanda's traps be more planned out, forcing their victims to take part in them rather than the rather coincidental approach to the second film where the victims seemed to be allowed to avoid the traps if they could. One facet of the story of "Saw 3" that I really enjoyed were the flashbacks to events surrounding the first two films, which really deepened the story for the overall franchise and connected each of the films together even more than before. For the most part, I liked that the flashbacks explained the change in how the traps went from being escapable to impossible to survive, and also how careful the planning was for the traps used in the first film. One complaint I did have with the flashbacks was the fact that we are introduced to Jigsaw's past, which was fine, but we are shown a woman with whom he is seemingly in love with, but we learn nothing about her other than the fact that we see them together for a couple of scenes. I really hate it when a movie simply introduces an element into the plot that is intended to be resolved in the next film, so that nothing comes of it in the current movie you are watching. Why bother including a segment in one film if nothing will come of that segment until the sequel, just wait and include the segment when you (meaning the writers) are ready to flesh it out further. Because the segment, though intended to show a much softer Jigsaw from the days before he became the monster he now is, was ultimately pointless and even more irritating due to the fact that it seemed like it's sole purpose was for us to feel some empathy for Jigsaw, and view him more as a normal human who has slipped into a state of insanity, rather than a man who was merely masking the monster hidden deep within.<br /><br />The traps of "Saw 3" were just as I had initially felt, they were way too grotesque and seemed to be intended to shock and gross out the audience as much as possible rather than scare us. I don't understand why horror films have shifted from trying to scare the audience with atmosphere, story and a genuinely creepy villain, but instead have chosen to simply shock us by including as many gross sequences as possible into a 90 minute film, but that's what the powers-that-be must feel is needed to make a successful horror film these days. Maybe it's because we moviegoers have become de-sensitized to such things, that the only way the moviemakers feel they can scare us is by shocking us with as much blood, gore, and sadism as they can get away with under the guidelines of the increasingly liberal MPAA rating system.<br /><br />As a franchise, the 'Saw' series has definitely fallen into the school of thought within filmmaking that feels it is necessary to show the most gore possible to give the audience a good scare. When this franchise began, the original film was more of an actual horror film, in the vein of the old school horror films from Alfred Hitchcock ("Psycho") and John Carpenter ("Halloween"), relying more on atmosphere and the audiences own imagination to create genuine thrills with which to scare us, not buckets and buckets of blood. However, over the course of three films, the 'Saw' series has become just another horror franchise, albeit with much better scripts than your average horror movie (which allows these films to rise above the rest of the current crop of horror offerings), but one can definitely see the downward spiral in terms of quality that is occurring within the series.<br /><br />The characters of "Saw 3" were much better than those within "Saw 2". This time around I actually cared whether the main characters survived their respective traps, unlike in "Saw 2" where I would have been fine if the majority of them failed their tests. The new cast members to the franchise fit into the same profile as those of the previous film. Both of the two new lead characters were portrayed by acting talents that many people would recognize if they'd seen them, but most likely not by their names. Bahar Soomekh (TV's short-lived drama "Day Break") was solid as Lynn, the doctor who had all but abandoned her family emotionally, but in the midst of Jigsaw's trial, discovers that she longs for nothing more than to hold her family members yet again. She was so genuine in her desire to do what is right according to the oath she took as a doctor by helping Jigsaw through the pain of his cancer, and at the same time she was so afraid of losing her life to the trap she was in that she was tempted to take a life in cold blood. The character of Jeff, the distraught father, as portrayed by Angus MacFadyen ("Braveheart") was a character that was so consumed by his thirst for revenge that he teeters on the edge of sanity, and is struggling to retain his last shred of humanity so he can be there for his daughter that desperately wants her father back. Angus portrayed the conflict within Jeff perfectly, each of the trials that he faced tested his thirst for vengeance, while at the same time threatening to strip him of his last shred of humanity, and each time Angus played the indecision perfectly, and in the end gave audiences a character that was so deeply flawed, and yet the audience couldn't help but relate to him and his struggles.<br /><br />"Saw 3" is a better movie than "Saw 2", and felt more in line with the tone and quality of the first movie. However, as improved as "Saw 3" was, it still fell prey to the shortcomings of its predecessor by featuring an over abundance of gross-out moments intended to shock the audience rather than scare it, and way too much blood and gore, to the point that it detracts from the overall movie.<br /><br />"Saw 3" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain violence, language, and nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>U know the first SAW, was SCARY and SHOCKING in the end, Frezz me & people in the chair End of "SAW" in the theater!!

This is not because the movies are running out of ideas (the twists, although expected, still have some creative bite to them) or because they are lacking a certain gruesome appeal (the films have a faithful fan base that has made the movies a Halloween tradition).  Instead, it's because the makers of this third flick, by the last frame, appear to have painted themselves into a corner with a bucket of pig guts and brain juice.<br /><br />But, if there's one thing the Saw movies have to teach us (and they go out of their way to pretend that they have a lot of teaching to do), it's that appearances can be deceiving.  This lesson I believe.  The rest of Saw's lecturing, well, it's hard to listen to a sermon when the pastor is ripping your arm off.<br /><br />All of the usual suspects are back this time around, with Jigsaw (a pale-as-rainwater Tobin Bell) and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), providing us with yet another meticulously macabre experiment in death and personal redemption.  This time the primary subjects are Jeff (a man subsumed by grief for his son, Dylan, killed by a hit-and-run driver) and Lynn (an ER doctor who is addicted to pain killers and her own ennui).  Jeff is given the opportunity, in a series of tests, to watch those responsible for his son's demise (a witness, a judge, the driver himself) meet their maker.  Or, if he chooses the moral high ground, Jeff can save them.  Lynn, meanwhile, has a much easier task: keep the dying Jigsaw alive long enough to watch this last game play out.  If Jigsaw's heart stops beating, so does hers.<br /><br />How Jeff and Lynn are connected is anyone's guess (and your first one will probably be right), but, as per usual, the film still has a few bloody aces up its sleeve.  Shot in a line-up of primary colors (each scene has its own color schema) and grittily textured, it's the most visceral Saw, yet.  Thankfully it doesn't trade (too much) of its brains for blood; just as the second film capitalized on elements of the first, this third covers the bases in all of them and -- if you watch close enough -- does, in fact, set up a few questions to be answered in a fourth.<br /><br />Some might not be interested in questions like these, though.  Although the franchise hasn't really lost its edge, it does appear to be losing steam.  Each Saw is staged, in some way, as a morality play, with people trapped inside their own brand of sick salvation.  The first movie was both inventive and focused.  The second widened its aim and, as such, missed a few targets.  This third film, with its ever-more-intricate web of wicked wisdom, almost collapses under its own weight.  Here's hoping that the next Saw tries to cut out its Deeper Message with a chainsaw, instead of a finely-edged scalpel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>After consecutively watching the entire Saw series over a recent weekend (and LOVING it), I decided that a single review with modified details could be used for all the films.  Enjoy.<br /><br />A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.<br /><br />Saw THREE begins with ONE person trapped in an abandoned MEATPACKING PLANT.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John "Jigsaw" Kramer) game, JEFF (Angus Macfadyen) has to prove his will to live, and his ability to FORGIVE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. MARK HOFFMAN (Costas Mandylor) are investigating as a team, but ALLISON KERRY may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participant learns that AMANDA YOUNG (Shawnee Smith) may be an accomplice to his abduction, and his situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS (for OTHERS) or guaranteed death (for his family).  To help his cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka life perpetrator) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.<br /><br />Several murderous contraptions like the CHAIN CHAIR (for a HABITUAL CRIMINAL), the PIG VAT TRAP (for an ACTIVIST JUDGE), and the NECK BREAKER RACK TRAP (for a MURDERER) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene EXPLODING RIB ANGEL TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S MODUS OPERANDI, and on to Saw IV.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>Saw III picks up right where II left off and then forwards goes six months ahead, a new victim is discovered is an inescapable trap. Usually "patients" of John "Jigsaw" Kramer can escape the games; this time the trap is unusual which brings questions about the inventor of this trap. Saw III is basically a large and complicated game much like the first movie. Jigsaw is dying and Amanda brings in Doctor Lynn Denlon who has to keep him alive for the game's length in order to succeed her game. Meanwhile her husband Jeff is the one playing the "real" game which will decide of everyone's fate. This one is also Amanda's big test even if she doesn't know it. The fact that Saw III is so complex, logical and that it makes sense at the same is quite an accomplishment for a horror movie as they rather ignore connectivity from a movie to another, Saw does not. It's obvious that with this third movie they tried to end the trilogy while knowing that there might be a next movie, they could have ended Saw right there if they wanted to. It is the most profitable Saw movie to date having earned an estimated total of $164,874,275 worldwide.<br /><br />I feel this is one of the better Saw movies, first of all it has a great story and its complicated which I think is what fans will love about it. Secondly why someone may or may not like it is because it's the goriest of the Saw movies in my opinion, the traps are amazing I felt they put in some extra effort for those.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 6:40 Mins<br /><br /></span></p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>saw three is the glue to the other two because saw 3 brings em' all together. it's like a 6 hour movie cut into 3 Movies. saw three is more gruesome and distubing than the first two wich makes it alot more fun to watch. i haven't seen a horror movie trilogy more disturbing than saw. you gotta love em'.

It's more like a demented version of a slasher film. These films in essence rely on buckets of gore to scare their audience but therein lies the rub: it doesn't scare. Instead what it does is create a feeling of disgust, a "eww!" or a cringe rather than chill you to the bone and make you lose sleep. While I'll admit Saw was a pretty good film for what it was, on subsequent viewings it did fall apart and Saw II was just awful. Saw 3 is more in spirit to 1 but it's also filled with flaws from both.<br /><br />A bit more ambitious in scope, we follow 2 threads: Lynn, a doctor, is taken in by Amanda and Jigsaw because Jigsaw's tumor is getting worse and he wants to be alive to see the end of his next game. In another thread, Jeff, haunted by the death of his son, is not being tortured but what's tested is his need for revenge: he meets people that are strapped into torture devices and he has to get them out. Of course, in the world of Saw, it's not that simple.<br /><br />Be forewarned: this is definately the goriest film the series has seen. Does it work? Kind of. The victims are dispatched in unbelievably gruesome ways but rather than let your imagination take over, we see everything so nothing is left to wonder about. While it does make you cringe, especially one scene involving surgery, it doesn't really scare you to the point where you get goosebumps but rather you're hoping your dinner doesn't come up. Luckily the film has enough of other things to take your mind off it rather than just mindlessly putting in gore for the sake of it(I'm looking at you Hostel).<br /><br />How's the story and everything else? It's actually better. While there is plotholes and inconsistencies and whatnot, it's also a bit more better written and being able to juggle various stories, including scenes that involve the first 2 flims are fun so this is much better than part 2. Will we get a more super-duper version later on? I don't see how. We have all the gore we need, 3 commentaries and featurettes so what else needs to be shown? Although to capitalize on the inevitable Saw IV, we'll probably get another.<br /><br />I don't know if you'll want to buy it unless you love this stuff but give it a rent then make your decision then. Me? I liked it, far from loved but I wouldn't want to own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Jigsaw is back, and he's got a nubile babe for an apprentice, the kind that'd make my nethers tingle if it wasn't for the fact she's a real sick twist.  Based on a screenplay by Leigh Whannell (Saw, Saw II), Saw III was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II), and features Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning, The Quick and the Dead) reprising his role as Jigsaw, the methodical master of malicious mayhem.  Also appearing is Shawnee Smith (The Blob), Angus Macfadyen (Cradle Will Rock), Bahar Soomekh (Crash), Donnie `Donnie D' Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers), and 1980s B movie favorite Betsy Russell (Private School, Tomboy), whose fianc&eacute; Mark Burg happened to be one of the numerous producers on the film, in a minor role.<br /><br />The third installment picks up where the last one left off as we see detective Eric Matthews (Wahlberg) in a familiar situation (familiar, at least, to someone who's seen the previous films), in a dank, grimy, dimly lit room, his leg shackled to a pipe, a rusty hacksaw within reach.  What follows is pretty wild (and messy), as Eric manages an escape, but not the way you might expect.  After this there's some bits with Eric's colleague Detective Kerry (Meyer), to which we move along into the story proper as we meet an attractive ER doctor named Lynn (Soomekh), whose life seems fraught with misery and despair, despite the appearance of having it all.  Anyway, after she's kidnapped by a figure donning a hog head, she finds herself in the Guru of Gristle's lair, a large, funky looking warehouse with intermittent lighting, filled to the brim with all kinds of wicked looking devices.  Lynn soon learns the reason behind her abduction as she meets the sickly Jigsaw (if you recall he was extremely ill in the previous film), along with his attractive assistant, the reason being to keep Jigsaw alive, with the cost of failure being her own life.  Seems Jiggy's got a game going, one he wants to be around for to see all the way through.  After this we meet the primary player in Jigsaw's most current game, a pathetic sack named Jeff (Macfadyen), as he's put through a series of tests, all of which involve other individuals suffering greatly, with Jeff having the ability to save them (for the whys and what nots you'll have to watch the film).  As Jeff progresses through Jigsaw's diabolical maze of gory madness, Lynn finds herself having to perform a little brain salad surgery, all while Jigsaw's assistant, who's a few clowns short of a circus, descends deeper into her own, personal pit of psychosis.  After a ton of flashbacks and some pretty horrific deaths, things eventually come full circle resulting in some memorable revelations.<br /><br />While I thought this third entry into the series entertaining, I think it is important to mention the importance of seeing the previous films prior to watching this one as there's a lot of references tied to what occurred previous i.e. this is not a stand alone sequel, as may be the case with other franchise features.  Now you could watch this film and follow along somewhat without having seen the previous entries, but you'll appreciate the complexities of the overall story all the more having all the pieces of the puzzle.  I did enjoy the concerted efforts to directly relate this to the previous films, but I thought the flashbacks to be excessive at times, especially the ones that filled in gaps that weren't necessarily vital in the overall scheme of things (Was anyone particularly enlightened by learning Jigsaw had help in setting up Dr. Gordon in the first film?).  Another aspect I didn't care for occurs near the end, after an important revelation...once revealed the filmmakers go through an extensive series short flashbacks perhaps to reinforce the impact, but it seemed more an effort to spoon feed the audience the all the bits that led up to said revelation, as if we weren't all that bright to get it in the first place.  I was paying attention so the events tied to the revelation weren't lost on me, and I felt it unnecessary to rehash the material.  Another bit that annoyed me slightly was the lighting in Jigsaw's lair...I thought it odd how many lighting fixtures worked on a sporadic basis, flashing on and off.  I know this was done to help create an atmosphere, but it became a little irritating after awhile.  The traps featured here were pretty wild (and vicious), and the gore factor high.  There are some real nasty devices throughout, the worst, in my opinion, being the rack, which Jigsaw claimed his personal favorite (the shotgun shell collar was a trip, as was the hideous hog-o-matic processor).  I won't reveal any more about it, but know it provides for a whole lot of intense, lingering pain before delivering death.  There are a few twists near the end, one of which, involving Lynn, I thought particularly well done, especially given the fact Jigsaw provided a good deal of clues prior to the revelation.  These clues seem innocuous statements initially, but once fully understood, they provide a respectable punch to the gut.  The performances were suitable, the story thoughtful and generally well crafted (there are a few holes and elements that require a good deal of suspension of disbelief), the atmosphere suitably grimy and ookie, and the pacing reasonable.  The story was complicated, but I thought Bousman, along with his editor, did a good job in keeping things orderly, ultimately paving the way for another sequel.<br /><br />This unrated DVD version (which runs 113 minutes compared to the 107 minute theatrical runtime), released by Lions Gate, features a sharp looking, widescreen anamorphic (1.78:1) picture, along with a vibrant audio track, available in both 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital for English and Spanish.  There's a healthy assortment of extras including three featurettes, the first titled The Traps of Saw III, another titled The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III, and a third called Darren's Diary: Anatomy of a Director.  Also included are three commentary tracks, one featuring director Darren Lynn Bousman, writer/executive producer Leigh Whannell, and producers Oren Koules and Mark Burg, a second featuring executive producers Peter Block and Jason Constantine, and a third with director Darren Lynn Bousman, editor Kevin Greutert, and director of photography David A. Armstrong.  On top of that are deleted scenes, subtitles in English and Spanish, a theatrical trailer, a theatrical teaser, and trailers for Crank (2006), Saw Special Edition DVD, Saw II Special Edition DVD, The Punisher Extended Cut DVD, The Invincible Iron Man (2007) animated feature, and Hostel II (2007).  If you really thrive on extras, this is a decent edition to get, but you might want to wait and see if Lion's Gate, a company that seems to specialize in double dipping, is going to eventually release a two DVD special edition of the film, as they did with the previous Saw movies.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, am I the only who thinks Shawnee Smith looks a lot better with long hair?</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>Now that the Halloween ritual is over, so is the only good reason to see "Saw III" at a theatre. So here are some observations for those reading these comments while trying to decide whether they should pay good money to see the movie.<br /><br />First off look at the situation objectively, by its third installment the "Saw" franchise has become what the film industry refers to as a "pre-sold" product. This means that during the pre-production phase it was known that virtually anything released to theatres with the title "Saw III" will do substantial business. For those (including myself) who enjoyed the first two, it would be a much-anticipated Halloween ritual. We would purposely not read comments or reviews (or even view trailers) to insure a completely pure viewing experience. Our tickets were essentially sold before "Saw II" had closed at our local mega-plex.<br /><br />Although these economics guaranteed the production of the third installment (and apparently a fourth one), they provide no incentive for producing a film worthy of the preceding two. The original entry had to be good or suffer a "direct to video" fate, and the second benefited from (but was not over-whelmed by) a more professional production process because of its higher budget. In additon for the second one there was considerable incentive to prove that the first was not a lucky fluke.<br /><br />Further red flags go up when you see that "Saw III" is using a "worldwide" saturation booking technique normally reserved for weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres (3167 in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide). This is normally done with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance. If a film is good it will be exhibited more discreetly because the producers are counting on positive "buzz" to promote attendance and reduce marketing costs.<br /><br />Finally, the critics have overwhelmingly trashed "Saw III", even those who were extremely positive about the first two.<br /><br />So as a potential (not a pre-sold viewer), you get on this site and sift through the comments to try to get a handle on the quality of the film while avoiding major spoilers; and you find an extremely divergent set of comments. My advice is to dig a little deeper into the source of the comments, click to see the comment history of each author. It is generally a good idea to give more weight to the more prolific writers-especially those whose comments about other films mirror your reactions.<br /><br />In the case of "Saw III", the extremely positive (and least detailed) comments on the IMDb are almost exclusively from people for whom this is their first comment. If this seems extremely odd and if you are into conspiracy theories, you should at least consider the possibility that these are planted as part of the film's marketing campaign.<br /><br />As for myself, I cannot imagine anyone who has not seen the first two films getting much enjoyment out to the third. Although there were times during the viewing process where I wished I was in this group because at least the confusion would have provided some degree of mental challenge during what turned out (IMHO) to be an extremely boring feature.<br /><br />Nor would I expect anyone who did not get off on blood and gore to find this an enjoyable experience. The "Saw" films are in the horror sub-genre made famous by Dario Argneto and Mario Bava. This is called the "gialli" (yellow) style. These two Italian makers of horror/ thrillers place a huge emphasis on the deed of murder whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder.  Inherent in this style is almost constant self-parody, necessary to expand the target audience beyond the wiggers and drones who flock to the local mall.  The parody element fundamental to the first two installments is in short supply in "Saw III",  deliberately inserted into only one scene-the pig rendering trap.<br /><br />Checking my watch every ten minutes I kept hoping that something would happen to give an interesting tilt to what I had already seen, as had happened in the first two. But by the midway point I had abandoned this (not the checking of my watch but the expectation that any magician could pull a rabbit out of this lame hat).<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Saw III' directed by Darren Lynn Bousman is cut from the same cookie cutter script as the previous two movies, without the novelty of the first, but with just a scant improvement in plot over the second. The `Saw' series is the exemplar for an entire new genre of horror movie which can to some extent trace its roots back to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. While these have been criticized as being nothing more than exercizes in blood and Sadism, I really find them big improvements over the very tired plotlines arrising out of the Halloween model which has been done to death a at least 13 times over and more. The basic premise replaces the na?ve teenager oblivious to the danger lurking behind him, with a fully aware victim in imminant peril that they fully appreciate, and which is drawn out with building expectation rather than diving in with a quick kill. Thus, in spite of all the gore and paraphenalia, there is much more psychological terror and vicarious fear being dished out here than by most appearences by Freddy or Jason or whomever.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is the realization of how bare these movies are of new ideas. The whole premise of the first movie was culled from a three minute scene from `The Road Warrior'. And that was the best of the three movies. One of the opening `trap' scenes in this movie was taken from a similarly short scene in the first `Hellraiser' movie. The voice-over commentary from the director and producers make great exclamation on how well things are executed in this movie, totally ignoring the fact that the story line is radically disconnected and the behavior of the characters is improbable at best.<br /><br />There is much to the criticism of this sub-genre of horror movie, and the criticism would lead to believing that the films had no value whatsoever, except that nobody else is doing the `Perils of Pauline' sthick at all, let alone well. That said, I will say that the `traps', that is, `the good parts' in this movie, are just a bit better than `the good parts' in `Saw I' and `Saw II'.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>This Unrated version runs 1 hr. 53 min.<br />  The ending of this Unrated version is different than the Director's Version.

When we last left the intense dilemma, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) had beaten Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and through the maze of walls and doors in the warehouse, it was a race against time to find his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) and the other victims.

Since Kerry is so clever in solving the crime, she too becomes a prisoner of Jigsaw.<br />  We are introduced to two new characters: Lynn and Jeff.<br />  Lynn (Bahar Soomekh),who is a doctor, is captured in the hospital locker room by someone wearing a pig head. By Amanda (Shawnee Smith) she is brought to Jigsaw John, who is gravely ill lying in a hospital bed in a new secret place, the Gideon warehouse.  He wants Lynn to help him live. A collar device is put over her. There are 5 cocked gun barrels on this collar. If Jigsaw John's heart rate flat lines or she moves out of range, she will die at the same time as him.<br />  A man, Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), is trapped in a crate box. Jeff escapes and as he wonders through the warehouse, finds other people in deadly traps, Danica (Debra Lynne McCabe), Judge Halden (Barry Flatman) and Timothy (Mpho Koaho). He has his own series of tests to go through. That's part of the game.<br /><br />  For SAW fans, new footage: Amanda will reflect upon how she became involved with Jigsaw John and then preparing for the first game we saw in SAW (2004).<br /><br />  Costas Mandylor appears as "Forensic Hoffman" in SAW 3.

I'm not sure the skull operation scene close ups were entirely needed, but hey...Plus these movies give you some interesting ideas to think about in terms of 'what have I really done with my life? what kind of person would Jigsaw say I am?'. I give these movies points for this, because at least they're trying to get you to think, even if it's on a semi-surface level, and often lost in a sea of blood and shredded pig corpses.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This movie was another great horror movie.

The two victims, doctor and father, play their games while an agitated Amanda tries to keep her temper and jealousy under control and prevent herself from offing the doctor herself.

The weird part for me about this series is I don't like movies with torture-but this series has a demented cleverness to it that I didn't expect. The traps are sadistic but clever, the music is creepy, and Jigsaw's game in this one is something I admire-testing someone's capacity for forgiveness over revenge is a very interesting concept. When criminals go free it does make me angry, but hatred and revenge can have serious consequences, as this chapter demonstrates in gruesome detail. Kudos to Charles Clouser for the music score-I'm not sure even Jerry Goldsmith could've made a score this creepy. Special mention must be made to Tobin Bell as Jigsaw-what he does with his voice, making it raspy to the sound of a whisper was eerily effective,he gives me chills just hearing him talk, and his voice on his tapes are the same way. I'm not gonna lie though, a couple scenes/traps in this one did make me cringe, I look forward to part 5 though.<br /><br />August 8, 2010<br />The main focus of this film is on Jigsaw's apprentice forcing a doctor to keep him alive while another test/game is taking place. These tests and traps are creepy to say the least-esp. the pig vat in the middle. I don't want the director's cut of this chapter because I saw the d's cut of the ending and decided I don't need it.<br />Now, do I think they should've ended the series here? Hell, No! Despite the ending, I'm glad the creators have come up with not just one but 5 decent sequels that connect like a puzzle. After this film though, Leigh Whannell and James Wan stepped aside as scriptwriters, but the replacements so far have done a very nice job in keeping the series interesting, however I wish Darren Lynn Bousman could've continued directing, but oh well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Ahhh the halcyon days of 2006, when the ridiculous Saw franchise was somewhat less ridiculous for its villain was at least not killing people from beyond the grave; Saw III is certainly no great film (it's not even a good film) but with a plot that makes a reasonable amount of sense and a couple creatively grisly scenes, it's at least better than IV or V.<br /><br />2/4</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>SAW III takes us deeper into the mind of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) while upping the ante in the suffering / teaching department. Amanda (the most excellent Shawnee Smith) takes her place at Jigsaw's side, acting as his novitiate instrument of higher education. Many surprises are in store, as we are led through another of the Jigmeister's dark labyrinths. This time, his students will learn the futility of hateful revenge and the value of forgiveness. SAW III is a gruesome masterpiece of bloody horror, a puzzlebox full of razors. Possibly the best of the bunch (as of this writing SAW VI is in production).

Jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named Timothy Young. Jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child. My favorite trap in this one is the Pig Vat when Jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines. I love when Lynn has to perform surgery on Jigsaw and removing some of his skull to relax his brain. Will Jeff learn to forgive? Will Jigsaw live? Let's play a game and find out!

Though there is some greatness about the first Saw that gets a little lost in each of the sequals, there is more that is added too.  In the case of Saw 3, I must say the scenerios are as disturbing as ever, and becoming more complex and original.  The movie begins with a bone-crunching (literally) squirming start that already leaves a nasty flavor, and quickly moves to a scene with a man standing in an old classroom, with chains inserted throughout various parts of his body.  The bloodshed gets going in Saw 3, though the real scenario takes about 30 minutes to set-up.<br /><br />The Saw theme still continues in the third installment - "are you grateful to be alive?" and a little more is added to the mix about obsessive vegence.  Such is the case with Jeff.  His son has been killed in an accident.  Jeff is forced through a series of tests, placing him in contact with the various people he wishes were dead since they did nothing to help his situation (eyewitness, judge, and the killer himself).  Jeff's test is to see what lengths he will go to forgive these individuals and save them before the traps they are in expire.  This is where traps in Saw begin to take on a whole new level.  It's not merely bloodshed anymore, and though not always gore-filled, the scenarios are quite frightful such as a naked woman in a freezer room, constantly sprayed with water.  Or a man chained to the bottom of a pit, while hogs are liquified and dumped on him...yes you heard right.  The scene is enough to make one vomit.<br /><br />While Jeff is being tested, Jigsaw is on his deathbed, and another test is occuring.  Lynn is a doctor who must keep Jigsaw alive or she dies as Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith, who makes a recurring role from all the Saw films thus far) watches in frustration.  Keeping tradition going, you can expect another surprise ending you may not have seen coming, but would say is more predictable than the previous two Saw films.  People are being tested in the film, but in the end you begin to realize the bigger picture and what the bigger tests actually are.<br /><br />Saw 3 does a great job of keeping things in perspective with the prior films, mostly the first Saw, which is fine by me since it is the original and I thought a stronger movie than Saw 2.  There are plenty of flashbacks of Amanda, how she became Jigsaw's apprentice, and we even get to see some prequal shots that went into the making of the bathroom scene in Saw.  Saw 3 even begins exactly where Saw 2 left, with detective Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg again reprising the role) locked up in that same bathroom.<br /><br />Saw 3 is a good continuation to the series.  The story remains fairly complex, interesting and somewhat unpredictable, though still looses the greatness of the first two movies.  If you are looking for blood, gore, and terrifying traps, Saw 3 goes all out this time.  I say, just be grateful with your life so you don't have to ever experience them.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Horror/Gore - 5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>This film helps to make the story of Jigsaw even more complex.  A great addition to the franchise.  Nothing is ever simple in the Saw series and this installment is no exception.  Horror fans should be pleased.  These films seem to be very "fluid" in continuity, film style and feel.  Many other filmmakers could learn from that alone.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>Liked the first "Saw", hated "Saw 2", liked "saw 3" but have some complaints.  The first problem I have is they always seem to use these "dumb white guys" for the protagonists in the films.  it's like, how can you really pull for them and feel sorry for their situation, when their character is borderline unlikable from the get-go?  I also find the storyline abit confusing at times, there is so much going on, you seem to have to be completely wrapped up in all of the films storylines to understand fully what's going on.  As far as gore, this had got to be the most digusting horror film I have EVER seen.  I almost never have to look away from the screen but on this one, I simply cannot watch the brain surgery scene or the twist torture sequence at the end.  I can only look for a second and then immeadiatley look away again.  I guess this could be a good thing, that's why were horror fans right?  This was Shawnee Smith's movie, I love her in some other films, she's always plays quirky roles.  I wish she would have acted more edgy and bizarre like in some of her other roles.  Check her out in "Leaving Las Vegas" and "The Stand".  She rocks.  I still haven't seen Saw 4, can't wait even though it seems like I'm sort of dissing the whole franchise, I still want to see saw, huh?</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the saw3 (I haven't seen 4 yet) so saw2 got 5 stars, saw3 gets only 3 stars.<br /><br />Traps in 3 include: a) Angel trap (my fav) - metal parts stitched to the ribs so when the wings open, its bye bye ribs. Everything comes flying apart. Basically you end up missing your whole torso. 2) pig mincer 3) body wrencher - neck, legs, and arms are wrenched 360 degree to provide some cool and inventive death/torture 4) big freeze 5) head detonation. (they actually show you the stump that gets left behind eeeeks !!!!)  SFX guys you rock in this movie. This movie is all about the FX. The pigs were artifically made so that they cud be thrown in the pig mincer/juicer scene. watch the fx commentary on the extras in the "traps section"<br /><br />Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the "the traps of Jigsaw" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary. There is a "making of". You'll be find renting this one beter off. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.<br /><br />This one is not as psychological as 2. This is more in your face blood and guts. Its all about ribs flying apart, intestines comming out, bones being broken and heads being blow apart. Pls be warned this one is the most most grossest of the whole series. I mean it. Walk away from this movie if this kind of stuff gives you insomnia or nightmares.<br /><br />Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I dont think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened.<br /><br />Saw 3 is a total epsiode continuation of saw2. The characters start basically where they left off in 2. So if you don't see saw2 before seeing this one, you won't be able to make sense of the movie flow and login as there are a lot of flash backs to saw 2 . The set from saw 1 refuses to go away. The cut ankle is still lying there in that toilet and those ppl are still there with their decomposing bodies. "Ohh yes there will be blood" he said. And you know what, 3 doesn't delievers blood alone, it just spills out ribs, guts and flesh. Satisfaction gauranteed.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie. I loved Saw, but I was a little disapointed with Saw 2. Saw 3 more than makes up for it! The tests and death scenes are gruesome, and the characters are more likeable and realistic. There are many twists and turns, and I can't wait to see Saw 4! It'll have to be pretty good to keep up to this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>After the events of the second movie, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) has joined with criminal mastermind Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) for another round of gruesome torturous murder sprees. They kidnap a female doctor named Lynn (Bahar Soomek) so they can help Jigsaw with his tumor problem, a new victim named Jeff (Angus Macfayden) must do important tasks to save the lives of victims ready to be tortured for purposes so he can find out who is the real person that killed his son.<br /><br />Over the top and extremely violent entry of the "Saw" franchise with decent acting and plenty of brutality such as the acid test, freezing, body twisting and more that will have gorehounds cheer with it's realistic make-up effects. It's not the end of the franchise for it will have several more interesting sequels such as the excellent "Saw 4" that came out recently, i swear these movies keep getting more fun and more interesting.<br /><br />This DVD contains the much more extended version with more gore and character development then the previous unrated and theatrical editions. The extras include three audio commentaries, Trivia game, music videos, Looking Tortured: A look at how you can make make-up like some of the characters in a movie, Filmmakers Faves on the opinions of the actors and filmmakers favorite lines traps and scenes are and a look at Saw IV.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>Since the first "Saw" came out, a highly low-budget film mostly panned by critics which has become surprisingly successful, the sequels have taken the idea and managed to make it if not any deeper or more complex plot-wise, they were certainly more enjoyable.  It's especially entertaining to see in Saw II as Donnie Wahlberg's character is driven nuts just talking to Jigsaw, who promises his son's "safe" delivery if he just stays and talks (note: safe not put in quotes because its untrue, it's just a spoiler)<br /><br />****SPOILERS ALERT****<br /><br />Saw III starts out with a much denied rumor proven true of Donnie Wahlberg returning as the cop from Saw II.  He is placed in the same bathroom as Adam and Lawrence were in the first, but rather than saw his foot off, he does somethng more gruesome (bashing his foot so it can slide through the cuff) and then goes after Amanda who is still in the catacombs.  He nearly succeeds in killing her, but she eventually prevails.<br /><br />Then we move on with the usual someone caught in Jigsaw's trap, and showing more people caught in his traps.  But there's something different about these ones... no one is surviving the traps, and while some of them are particularly impossible (try removing a metal ring that is connected to your jaw, beneath your tongue and behind your chin), even if the person somehow managed to survive it, their traps do not let them go.<br /><br />Before the main victims are introduced, the sole recurring character (save for Jigsaw and Amanda) from the franchise (played by Dina Meyer) discovers that Jigsaw's traps have become inescapable, and the slaughter is becoming more brutal without any particular justification.  As she makes this revelation, she is now caught in one of Jigsaw's traps, and would have escaped, but her contraption failed to open with the key she retrieved in a cup of acid, and she dies.<br /><br />Now we are introduced to the characters.  I have mixed feelings about them as I love Angus Macfeyden as an actor, and he certainly brings his character as much to life as he can, while the woman playing his wife (Lynn) seems quite bored in the beginning where she's shown going to work after having an affair.  Macfayden's character (Jeff) is perpetually tormented by the death of his son in a car accident, and the person involved has been let off and so his life falls apart as he devotes himself to tracking the people down and--probably--killing him.<br /><br />Quickly, the two are captured by Jigsaw's new assistant, Amanda, and placed in their respective traps.  Lynn, being the doctor, is fixed with a neck-contraption with shotgun shells which will ignite and kill her if a now-bedridden Jigsaw dies, and she is responsible for keeping him alive.<br /><br />Jeff, meanwhile, is placed in a gauntlet of a different kind of torture.  Rather than suffer physically, he is made to suffer mentally as Jigsaw's gauntlet leads him to rooms where other people are placed in brutal traps.  Each person has a tape with them, which is addressed to Jeff, and told how each person was partly responsible for either his son's death or the mistrial resulting in his killer's escape from justice.  Jigsaw's test is to see if he can forgive them for their actions or inactions and help them to escape the traps.<br /><br />The first is a woman who was jogging that morning that Jeff's son was hit, and refused to testify in court.  She is stripped naked and chained by her hands in the middle of a freezer, while a machine sprays her with misty water every few minutes, intending to freeze her.  Jeff is reluctant to free her at first, but soon overcomes this and attempts to retrieve the key to let her go (resulting in a nasty flesh wound on his cheek) but by the time he gets it, she is completely frozen over, and the lock as well.<br /><br />The next room he goes into he must free the judge who dismissed the case due to lack of evidence.  He is strapped by the neck at the bottom of a pit while a machine takes pig carcasses and drops them in a grinder, shooting the liquified pigs into the pit to slowly drown him.  Jeff must get the key to shut the machine off by burning his son's stuffed animals which Jeff kept to himself obsessively after his son's death.  He gets it in time to save the man, and they move on.<br /><br />Meanwhile, while Lynn is caring for Jigsaw, we get some insight not only into Jigsaw and his past, but also insight into Amanda, and how her apparent Stockholm Syndrome with Jigsaw evolved into a full-on obsession, so much so that she begins to grow insanely jealous with Lynn, whom Jigsaw is treating benevolently, while scolding Amanda for lashing out emotionally.  She relieves the pain by cutting her thighs.<br /><br />There are also some very nice and insightful flashbacks, showing that Amanda's assistance of Jigsaw has extended as far back as Dr Gordon and Adam in the first movie.  We see her preparing Jigsaw for his stint in the room, taking a drug to slow his breathing and heartbeat (so he can appear a corpse) while also placing Adam in the cold bath and setting up everything.  We even see her coming in after Jigsaw has left Adam in the bathroom, and see her reviving a still-alive Adam and then murdering him (by wrapping a plastic bag around his head), and the rush she gets from killing him.<br /><br />We also get to see flashbacks showing Amanda developing an almost daughterly obsession with Jigsaw, and her growing taste for murder.  We find out she is the one responsible for making Jigsaw's traps unwinnable, and Jigsaw is not oblivious to this.<br /><br />Back with Jeff and the judge, they come into the final room, where the man who killed Jeff's son is placed in a crucifix-style trap.  It slowly begins to twist his limbs one by one in 360 circles, and the key to unlock the man from the device is hanging inside a glass tube connected to the trigger of a shotgun.  Jeff is obviously hesitant, but with the pressure of the judge, he decides to help him, but is having trouble trying to get the key without setting off the shotgun.  We are led to believe that the shotgun is empty and that this is merely a test of Jeff's willingness to shed some of his own blood to save another.  Still, he yanks the key and jerks away, just as the shotgun fires off and accidentally hits the judge who is standing off behind him.  Jeff attempts to use the key to free the man in the trap, but the key does not fit (Amanda's doing) and he is killed with the crucifix twists his head completely around, and Jeff is left alone now.<br /><br />Jeff finds his way to Jigsaw's workshop somehow, and Amanda grows further infuriated with Lynn.  She then pulls out her gun and shoots Lynn, only to then be shot by Jeff who has found a gun nearby.  Jigsaw then reveals to Amanda that he has been testing her as well, and that she has failed.  Now that they are confronted, Jigsaw challenges Jeff with his last test---to forgive Jigsaw, for putting him and his wife in this situation.  Jeff says he forgives him---then retrieves a buzz saw and slits Jigsaw's throat.  As he starts to bleed to death, he unveils a tape recorder in his hand, and plays a pre-recorded message for Jeff in the event of Jigsaw's death.  He tells Jeff of what will happen, that he has failed, and that now he can never save his child---as Jeff had been told in Jigsaw's first tape that he would save his child, thinking it to be his son by getting justice for his death, when he never realized that Jigsaw had also kidnapped his daughter and placed her in a secret place.<br /><br />As Jigsaw flatlines, Lynn's neck contraption goes off and kills her, and Jeff is left to wail loudly in pain as his wife is dead, his daughter missing, and the exits to the hideout are closed shut by automatic metal doors, effectively trapping him inside.<br /><br />All in all, there was a lot more attempts at a philosophy in Jigsaw's torturous tests, and a lot of deeper insight into the minds of Amanda and Jigsaw, as well as a strong theme of forgiveness.  Along with this, it is also much much gorier than the previous two, but nothing that is both gross and traumatic (like live amputations and such).  One of my favorite gory scenes was the emergency brain surgery performed by Lynn on Jigsaw using power tools and stolen medical equipment :P<br /><br />While not something deep and thrilling, it was an enjoyable ride, and I strongly oppose the studios' decision to call for a Saw IV.  It is over.  Jigsaw is dead, Amanda is dead, Kerry is dead, Detective Matthews is dead, Doctor Gordon is dead, Adam is dead, Lynn is dead, Jeff is dead, there's no one to go on other than lame copycats which we would rather not see.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>As Saw III begins, we find crooked Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) trapped and with a tough decision to make, while Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) finds herself captured by Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) as well, with an imminently grisly demise at hand.  Yes, it appears that Saw III is the end of the series as we know it (doubtful though) as Jigsaw's increasingly debilitating health leads him and Amanda (Shawnee Smith) to orchestrating one last, terrifying game.  This time around, a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) and her vengeful husband (Angus MacFadyen) are now pawns in what could be Jigsaw's last game; and needless to say, things don't turn out well for anyone at all.  Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the lacking second film in the series, returns to helm this chapter, and does considerably better this time around.  The traps and death scenes aren't as intricately put together as what we've seen before, but they're all the more grisly.  The gore level gets upped as well, as people are tortured and dispatched in ways that if they don't make you squirm, consider seeking help.  James Wan and Leigh Whannel, who crafted the first film in the series, are reportedly done with the franchise, but rumor has it that Lion's Gate won't let the Saw series ride off into the sunset just yet.  All in all, Saw III is a better than expected entry into what is becoming a predictable series, but let's hope that the Lion's Gate execs know when to call it quits.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>Even being just a little bit better than Saw 2, number 3 should be the end of the Saw series. Jigsaw's cruel games have now about reached their creativity limits. The deadly traps were the only reason to watch the second episode, but the story has now become too hard to believe.<br /><br />How have all these brilliant sadistic traps been constructed by a 70 year old guy and his small sized assistent Amanda? How the hell is such a couple capable in kidnapping grown men? Shame the great Saw movie has been turned from cult horror movie into a display of sadism. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Unlike Saw II, Saw III starts off on shaky ground and feels a bit forced. The traps are gorier and harder, while we find that we don't care all that much about the characters themselves. The acting is still good, but the story doesn't seem to meet the muster of the first sequel.<br /><br />The unresolved surprise ending involving Detective Matthews in Saw II is dealt with thoroughly here and answers many questions. But Saw III involves a new cast of characters to be tested by Jigsaw's games. Along with his sidekick Amanda, Jigsaw has kidnapped a female doctor and hooked his life support system to a device around her neck that will fire six rounds into her head if his heartbeat ever stops. Meanwhile a man whose son was a victim of a hit and run is forced to walk through rooms where each person who took part in that incident is being tortured in front of him.<br /><br />As the film goes on, the suspense seems to be dropping as the audience wonders why they should care about any of this. And although Jigsaw and Amanda provide a formidable evil duo, the momentum begins to drop due to an excess of gore and a cacophany of screams.<br /><br />In the end, though, it all pays off, and although the film itself doesn't live up to the original sequel, it's still much more interesting and mind-bending than most other horror films of this time. For a 3rd installment in a franchise, Saw III is a top-quality movie. The twists and the twisted nature of the film will leave fans eager for a fourth.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*Saw III* is gore galore!  You're going to see broken bones, ripped flesh, twisted flesh and bones and many more.  You'll even see decaying pigs turned into liquid. This film is definitely not for the squeamish.  I had to look away from the screen a few times.  The crime scenes you seen in CSI are G-rated compared to what you'll see here.  As a warning, don't eat while you're watching this film because you'll definitely lose your appetite.<br /><br />Jigsaw is at it again...except that he is dying.  Once again, Amanda (the sole survivor of Jigsaw's games from the first film) joins Jigsaw.  In this film, you'll see just how much Amanda is involved and why she holds Jigsaw dear.<br /><br />A doctor has been kidnapped to keep Jigsaw alive.  As long as Jigsaw is alive, she'll stay alive.  If he dies, she dies as well.  Meanwhile, a man has been kidnapped and is going through a game.  This man lost a son to a drunk driver and has since been obsessed with vengenance.  In this tailored game, he has to decide whether to forgive certain people or let them die in their own games.<br /><br />As I said before, Jigsaw is dying.  Amanda is emotionally unstable.  The doctor does everything to keep Jigsaw alive.  The grieving father is advancing towards his freedom.  Just who makes it out alive?  Who dies?  Just like the first and second movies, there's a twist.  The twist is so good that you won't believe you didn't think of it before.<br /><br />*Saw III* is a good movie that is just overloaded with gory stuff.  They make be fake but still, they can make you really squirm in your seats.</p></br></body></html>

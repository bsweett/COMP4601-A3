Sure, there are one or two jump moments, but overall its more of a slow-paced, character focused, classically inspired horror film. Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody both do a good job, staring as a scientific research couple whom secretly create a hybrid species in order to both further the advancement of the medical sciences and boost their egos. But as the hybrid grows, learns, and evolves, things become complicated for the couple. The majority of the film really focuses on these 3 characters and the relationships that develop between them. Splice is an interesting mix of Frankenstein/ Species/ and the Oedipus complex. This is defiantly the films strongpoint and the story makes for a good after-the-movie conversation. However Splice does suffer from some bad writing, primarily in questionable character decisions, but its not enough to completely ruin the viewing experience. The effects are quite good and the filmmakers did an excellent job of combining multiple visual techniques to bring the character of Dren to life. There is a little gore and some nudity, but not an overwhelming amount. Overall, Splice is refreshing and unlike what you typically find in Hollywood horror films these days. Although flawed, its still well worth checking out if your are a fan of classic horror/ sci-fi or you are just looking for a film that is a little different. 3 1/2 stars</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Two geneticists, played by Adrien Brody (OXYGEN, THE JACKET) and Sarah Polly (DAWN OF THE DEAD, NO SUCH THING), develop a female, human / animal hybrid. They name her DREN (yep, NERD backwards). DREN seems OK at first, but this is a horror film after all, so, unbelievable terror awaits! The idea of "Don't play god" (aka: "Don't mess around w/ nature") is older than this or any movie. SPLICE is a modern take on this theme, w/ the scientists facing the ethical / moral dilemma of their creation, as well as it's lethal potential. DREN is a well-realized, FX creature, and has several surprises in store. SPLICE does have it's silly moments (the dance lesson!), but makes up for this w/ originality.

What started out as an interesting plot and wonderful characters, took a deranged turn in the last 1/3 of the movie that I just couldn't stomach.  In fact, I think my first word to describe it was "brutal".<br /><br />Two scientists, Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrien Brody) have done a great job splicing together different animal DNAs to create a creature that gives off healing proteins.  Inspired by their work, they want to take it to the next level and splice human DNA in as well.  The problem is the pharmaceutical company they work for would rather them synthesize the healing protein instead of continuing with their work.  In secret, they decide to continue on their own.<br /><br />What they create is like no other creature.  She forms at a rapid pace and develops to be very humanoid.  But she is not all human, she also has a stinger, wings, and can breathe underwater.  Despite all these dangerous attributes, the two scientists begin to treat her as a child and care for her as she matures rapidly.  They name her Dren (Delphine Chaneac).<br /><br />As Dren matures, several things start to go wrong.  They have to move her from the lab to a safer place, Elsa's deceased mother's farm.  Here Dren seems to turn a bit feral, eventually seducing and turning on the scientists as they try to figure out what to do with her.  However, they may just be too late as Dren proves to be very dangerous.<br /><br />The characters in this film were interesting for the most part.  Clive is somewhat boring but considering he does some pretty wild stuff in this film at other times, I'll forgive him that.  Elsa I would have liked a little more background on.  It was clear the director wanted us to know her childhood was not very great, but he didn't really explain why it was important or what exactly happened.  The clues he gave were vague at best.  And the most important character of all, Dren was vastly complex and most of the time, pretty creepy.  It was amazing to see her develop and change and have her own unique personality.  The movie did a good job of making her seem human like, but still have different feelings and emotions that don't compare to a humans.  There are other side characters in the movie of course, but none play so big a role as to really take interest in.<br /><br />The concept of the whole movie was great.  I'm sure the die hard scientist type people will find numerous flaws with the way the science was done, but not knowing much on that myself, it seemed believable to me.  They did a great job of showing these characters and the CGI was very well done.  There was a little bit of music in the movie but not enough to really make you notice it.<br /><br />Now on to the stuff that I just did not care for.  This movie was rated R, which surprised me as there was some pretty deranged stuff in this film.  There are a couple sex scenes (no parts showing but you definitely know what they're doing), a rape scene and some graphic killings.  Aside from the squeamish factor, this isn't a movie for kids at all.  Normally stuff like this doesn't bother me, but for some reason, this movie just upped the disturbing level of these scenes and I didn't care for it at all.<br /><br />An interesting movie and very well made.  Because its more my own hangups on some of the scenes that made me dislike the movie I'm rating it higher than I normally would with something that disturbed me so much.  I think that's the interesting aspect of the film though, its not often something I know to be fake gives me the ick factor.  This is a very unique take on sci-fi and most fans of the genre should love it, just be warned it is not for the squeamish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>My spouse and I watched this one the other night and then immediately regretted it. We only kept viewing it till the end to make sure that it had so few redeeming qualities. We had high hopes that we'd be seeing something akin to Aliens or just a fairly original and suspenseful sci-fi flick. It would have been okay if it had just been mildly entertaining. Instead we viewed what seemed to be a nearly incoherent movie - and actually it was incoherent in parts - as well as at least one character who disappeared at the last moment, with no explanation.<br /><br />The sex scenes? My spouse and I both felt disgusted by those and we aren't uptight about sex scenes in movies. These were just pitiful, violent and made no sense. Were they just thrown in there in hopes of attracting some extra suspense or attention? If so, the attention was the wrong kind. I felt sorry for the actors in this film. Now watch...this will go on to be one of those movies which is so bad it becomes camp. I pray that doesn't happen. It doesn't deserve even that honor.<br /><br />I'd really like to read the script for this one. It is hard to believe that anyone signed up for this film in its final version. Perhaps they changed the script as the movie was being shot. If you are looking for entertainment, suspense, decent characters, and a sci-fi thriller, look elsewhere. If you are trying to watch a film to help you go to sleep, this might be a good choice. Barely watchable.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>I hope there is a director's cut of Splice.  I really, really, REALLY hope with the DVD it will be like 2007's I Am Legend and have on a bonus disc the film's original ending.  Why do I say this?  Well, I haven't researched much, but Warner Brothers once again - just as in I Am Legend - has a decent sci-fi movie that ends on a low-note.  I'll put it this way: up until the final 15 minutes I thought Splice was one of the best science-fiction films I'd ever seen.<br /><br />Just about everything in Splice works up until it reaches a generic, action climax.  Great acting from the cast and a sympathetic creature make the film a compelling sci-fi drama.  One of the best I've ever seen.  An easy 5/5 movie....until suddenly some executive seems to have decided the film needed to transform into a horror creature-feature in the last fifteen minutes.  It becomes so generic and predictable in these last 15 minutes and....terrible.  I can't see any explanation for this other than Warner Brothers repeating I Am Legend.<br /><br />Dren (the creature) was NOT a monster.  She was a fascinating individual creature that I could feel sympathy for.  The way Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) interact with Dren is very powerful.  You can tell that the characters come to love Dren and that Dren cares about them, making for a tragic, yet powerful ending to the film...until the before mentioned last 15 minutes appears which almost completely ruins this drama.<br /><br />Now, seeing as the film will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray I'm hoping to see an addition with "Controversial Original Ending!"  (by controversial they of course mean the GOOD ENDING).  I will re-evaluate the film at such a time as an alternate cut is released.  I refuse to believe that Guillermo del Toro, the writer of Pan's Labyrinth (who is the executive producer of Splice and someone who praised the script) could have supported a script that shoots itself in the foot in the ways that Splice manages to in its final 15 minutes.<br /><br />When Splice is released on DVD/Blu-Ray please, please, PLEASE hold out for a cut with the "original ending".  It may save you some money to buy a single-disc theatrical cut but please do NOT support WB's altering movies to make them "more marketable".  Splice is a great sci-fi movie that is destroyed by a lackluster ending that is entirely inappropriate given the dramatic nature of the rest of the film.  Tell Warner Brothers, and other companies that we want movies to have the endings that work FOR that particular movie.  Splice was NOT intended to be a horror movie and as such WB/producers shouldn't have attempted to transform it into one with 15 minutes of sub-par creature-feature footage that destroys the poignant beauty of the rest of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>this is a tense,atmospheric,drama/sci-fi/thriller.it deals with a topical issue,one that has been done before,but it works here.the issue is one of cloning.and the ethic and moral issues involved.it's a thought provoking movie and no matter what side of the fence you're on regarding this particular issue,it should engage you.it moves at a deliberate pace in order to to keep a tense atmosphere.the acting is solid all around,but Delphine Chan&eacute;ac stands out as Dren.if you're expecting an action packed movie with lots of things blowing up,you should look elsewhere.but if you're looking for something engaging and compelling,check this one out.for me,Splice is a 3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Splice" for the majority of the film's running time is an intelligent riveting sci-fi thriller.  Then the preposterous ending lands like a giant thud and undoes what good will the film engendered for 95 percent of it's running time.  Not to give away the farm the scriptwriters were probably going for a "Demon Seed" ending instead it's more reminiscent of "Humanoids From the Deep".  That would be okay except the latter film was deliberately campy.  I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and give the film a one star review.  Those unsuspecting be forewarned that the film's ending negates what could have been a really great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>SPLICE is of course a Frankenstein for the 21st century and once again warns DON'T MESS WITH MOTHER NATURE!  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are excellent in their leading roles, with Oscar-winner Brody showing his versatility.  Delphine Ceneac (sp) is remarkable as the ceature known as Dren, a truly unique "monster".  An interesting albeit predictable script and inspired direction make SPLICE an enjoyable sci-fi movie.  The controversial and predictable ending keep it from 5 stars, but it is a well made film.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>I didn't see any ads etc for this so it was all new to me upon first (and rather likely last) viewing. Unlike most reviewers here, the alien sex scenes didn't bother me a bit, but merely confirmed how irredeemably goofy this flick is.<br /><br />In fact, I'd wager that we'll be seeing more human/alien sex scenes in the next few years, so you might want to acclimatize. We're getting more and more hints in the media that not only may there be life out there in the trillions of planets (gosh, what are the odds?!), but who knows? Maybe WE are already alien/simian hybrids! It would certainly offer one of the few viable explanations as to how we're the only species on earth that reliably destroys its environment over and over. Remember that speech by Mr. Smith in The Matrix about how humans are a cancer on this planet? He might be a little too accurate.<br /><br />In any case, to me the alien sex scene was a whole lot less disturbing than what we see on the news every night. My tax dollars killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians...now THAT is truly disturbing. Whereas this movie is fiction. Our actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and elsewhere are not. It's fascinating how we've been conditioned to regard massive violence and military massacres as no problem, but we can't even see a pair of breasts on tv without freaking out about morality...even alien breasts that don't really exist.<br /><br />But beyond all that, Splice fails on so many fronts. The script misses endless chances to explore the ethics of interspecies gene splicing, the acting is weak at best (thought Sarah Polley had us hating her character pretty early on; she's very good at being annoying), and the pacing is mixed. Despite all that, we were entertained by it all, bad and good. It's shot pretty well, has a few amusing moments, and did hold our interest (even if it was just disbelief). Brody adds little, but Dren is quite entertaining...I like how she suddenly reveals whatever genetic accoutrements she needs, from wings to gills to a fully-loaded interstellar credit card (but only on the European dvd version).<br /><br />Dren was what made this worth sitting through, for me, and the concept raises enough questions and few enough answers to really make one ponder what is Right and what is Wrong...and if there even is such a dichotomy anymore. In fact, the best part for me was the ending (big spoilers coming); it makes perfect sense (and gets us sequel-ready) that the non-Heroine gets pregnant by an alien with her own dna...that's a near perfect metaphor for modern life! We're so far up our own butts we have no idea what's "right" any more, and you can bet that we'll be seeing interspecies slicing any day.<br /><br />In fact, it's almost a sure bet that the military is already doing it in their various black ops, and like I said it's also a fair bet that we are all carrying non-terrestrial dna around as well. We seem to give first use of all new tech to the military, so who knows how we'll first learn of it...a fake alien attack to promote a one-world government? Now there's a movie just waiting to be made.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend Splice if you enjoy bouncing all sorts of concepts around in your head, and are willing to withstand weak acting and writing in exchange for the chance to ponder many imponderables. Because what was once imponderable is now quite within the realm of "reality", and despite Splice's many failings, it raises plenty of thoughts worth thinking. The blu-ray has a good transfer, btw, and its detail shows how good the cgi on Dren was, at least.<br /><br />And to all you folks who were omg SO grossed out by the alien sex scene, let me ask you this: if you found out that the only way you could cure your child of a fatal disease was by someone, even you, having sex with an alien...might you not suddenly reconsider your moral stance? Stem cell research is but one step away from that, and one thing we've proven as a species is that when it all comes down to it, it ain't all for one and one for all, it's one for one. We're a mighty selfish bunch, and who knows what lines we'll cross to preserve our all-important personal dna...wherever it might be from.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The special effects make Dren, the hybrid creature,  look lively and scary.<br /><br />Only the first 40 minutes are suspenseful. After that, the movie becomes insipid, and predictable. What a waste! It has the potential to become a good science fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Splice is a movie about a couple, Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley, who are genetic engineers. They decide to splice genes with human DNA and end up with an almost human like creature which has amphibian and bird flight capabilities. Against their better judgment, they decide to keep the baby and study its lifespan. Obviously all good intentions are fraught with dangers and the movie shows us the dangers of humans trying to play good.<br />If you have very low expectations, which I did, you will be pleasantly surprised. The creature turns against the humans but has a personality and the movie tries to delve in to its psyche. This Frankenstein type of saga is watchable. Three stars. 11/15/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting Splice to be as memorable as it was.  Absolutely *exciting* the entire time- that's the best way to describe my honest feelings.<br /><br />The storyline is just terrific and done in a way that's neither confusing or overbearing.  It's about a man and his girlfriend (or wife, I forget) who are both scientists, and they spend quite a bit of time experimenting and creating creatures in their lab that are part human and part... something else.  As you can guess, this is totally illegal, so they have to constantly keep a low profile and hide their results during inspections and other times.<br /><br />Well the results are that the creatures that form are anything but normal (without spoiling too much for you, my loyal readers, hehe).<br /><br />What makes Splice a little different from most movies that fall in the same category is that you get to witness the creature start out as just a baby and watch it grow and develop with every new scene.  If you find these kind of films interesting, you will no doubt be sitting there and constantly guessing just what *will* the creature do next.  There's no telling.<br /><br />The man and woman play the role of parenting the adorable creature (yes I admit, it WAS adorable).  They soon discover that it's female.  At first the thing jumps around all over the room making the man and woman VERY nervous that it might need to be put down immediately, but after some heavy convincing on the part of the girlfriend, the creature lives on.<br /><br />I absolutely love the way the storyline rolls along.  Excellent writing because it keeps you wanting to know more.  You get to experience the creature go from a baby, to a teenager, and finally to an adult.  When it finally does become an adult (which happens extremely quickly, might I add) *this* is when things get interesting (and no, I won't be spoiling any key moments of storytelling- sorry!).<br /><br />So no, this is most certainly NOT a storyline about some chaotic monster experiment that eventually takes out the entire world- this particular movie is about a creature that sticks around a distinct group of people that it seems to refers to as family, and it's really appealing to witness the creature try to communicate with the man and woman throughout the film, and how much information it's capable of absorbing and understanding.<br /><br />One outstanding scene is when a presentation takes place inside an auditorium showing two baby creatures and their potential, and while locked inside the glass cage, something goes horribly wrong involving lots of blood and stabbing, resulting in everyone who attended the presentation to immediately take off running.  This scene was my favorite in the entire movie because the suspense was overwhelmingly superb.<br /><br />Overall, yes.  Splice does everything right.  It's entertaining, suspenseful, and while I initially didn't care for the acting in the beginning, it eventually won me over as well.  Just a great suspense (or sci fi- whichever one you feel more comfortable referring to it as).</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This is a compelling story that makes you think about the implications of trying to splice genetic material for the sake of creating new life forms.  Because they are so unpredictable, anything can, and does, go wrong. Such is the case with Dren, a creature that has a stinger tail, legs like a kangaroo, a face like a human's, and even wings.<br />Poor Dren is unstable and cannot control her conflicting emotions and sexual attraction to Adrien Brody's character, as well as her changeable feelings towards Sarah Polley's character.<br /><br />As one might imagine, all sorts of problems ensue. I won't spoil the movie by revealing them, but it is recommended viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>Creative movie ...<br />Just when you think it's going to get boring, it evolves.<br /><br />Profit drives research.<br />Research drives curiousity.<br />Don't ask about the cat ...

Though this is no great movie by any standard it is replete with the possibilities available for the subject. Here you have two romantically entwined gene scientists who grow a female something or other that lives and begins to mature. Now what? Looks like they didn't think that far ahead because things go so far that the situation begins to move under its own weight.<br /><br />The first act is kind of a drag. They're setting up the story and it involves a lot of science with read-outs, graphics and such, and it doesn't make for a very inviting viewer experience. When the second act starts though things begin to heat up, and as good it is, it also hints at all sorts of things the script doesn't deal with. Such as the fact that they're nurturing an intelligent female being that is maturing rapidly with no hope of ever having a true loving, sexual counterpart. This is also a being that has to be, because of legal issues, hidden from the rest of the world. She will never be part of "regular" society. There is also the area of physiology. This being has been created. All sorts of things can go wrong. Do all her parts work in harmony? How will food react with her system? Does she have too many teeth or too few? Will she have a menstrual cycle? Some of these things they deal with a bit, but there is a well spring of items that go untapped.<br /><br />The third act starts out pretty good but gets a bit too much at the climax. It could have been much worse though. I have to say that watching this movie made me more than a bit nervous. All the things roiling under the surface, but never brought forth, still made an impact on my nervous system.<br /><br />Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley do well in there rolls but Delphine Chaneac, as the being Dren, was outstanding. Kudos must go to both the art department and special effects department for their realization of the character. She is someone who will not be forgotten once she's been seen. This is well worth seeing. It might not be a perfect movie, but the highs are real high and make the rest of it watchable at the least.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>One reviewer noted that "Splice" has more in common with the films of David Cronenberg than anything Vincenzo Natali has been involved with.  That's an understatement.  This would be Vincenzo Natali taking direct cues from David Cronenberg and Piero Pasolini on a darker day and giving birth, no pun intended, to this disgusting piece of trash.<br /><br />Adrien Brody plays Clive Nicoli--his character's appearance itself is enough to tell you "not a quality movie" (bleached red hair and corporate hipster wear, just not jiving with Brody's regular appearance)--a young scientist who believes that anything is okay to do in science, blaming those "ignorant fascists" (meaning Christians) who think that any caution in science is unacceptable.  Sarah Polley plays Elsa Kast, his live in girlfriend who feels the same way.<br /><br />In short what happens is this: these two psychologically compromised people end up creating what looks like Sinead O Connor with a slice in the top of it's head.  As a baby it looks kind of appealing, and that's the cruel ruse of the movie: it wants to warm you up to the idea of this kind of "science", and then turn you on your head and stomach for ever having cherished the creature or the characters.  Let's just say that some disgusting things happen between the three (one count of incest, one count of rape), and the whole thing is like black bile.<br /><br />This is not even shocking art in the sense of "breaking taboos", it is just unpleasant and gross.

You are struck head on with the moral dilemma that perhaps we all must eventually deal with. This movie is not so much a scary movie as I thought is was marketed, it is a simple story of the difficulties and unforeseen consequences of choice. You will either come to hate the choice made in this film or else support it because of the possibility of wonderful benefits. I won't dare give away any major spoilers nor will I tackle the ethics that I dealt with. I thought that this movie was average. I had no unrealistic expectations, but still, I was bummed out that many possible ideas were not played with in this movie. It was cut and dry and touched upon what makes us human from a completely different perspective though.<br /><br />There are some disturbing moments in this film. Without spoiling it for you, I was mortified by the strange sexual confrontations of this film. How does it make you feel? I suppose this is a question left for your Physchologist after seeing this movie. Reality is so far driven from our minds in this movie, by its clumsy approach to rather fascinating concepts, that nothing I take in is weighty, but rather it becomes shallow, and without emotional investment. And the director of this film is a true visionary. He made Cube, which is everything that I value artistically, and yet, amazingly, is missing now. He has turned the page from those days, and entered into a new style. He abandons his Kafkaesque approach to film, and now, the company is in your face, with an attempt to play God.<br /><br />The special effects were nice if not bare, and the design of the "creature" was fascinating at most for me. I did think that some of the interactions in this movie were laughable. A new meaning of "men being men" in this movie. There were few surprises in this movie. I did come into this movie with an open mind as a student of science, but I did not think that this movie was presented the best. For instance, there are some interesting side experiments going on that they did not flesh out more than they could have. I wanted a more David Cronenberg fell to it, like his "fly" remake. I don't think people should avoid this film either, because the spliced creatures were interesting, and also some of the themes are worth exploring.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>Hands down, this has to be one of the worst sci-fi/horror movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />SPLICE casually dissects a fascinating and controversial element of science--genetic engineering.  It had a fairly large budget.  A top-notch acting crew.  It was co-produced by the awesome Guillermo Del Toro.  Plus it's been praised by critics and audiences alike.  There was no way for me to expect such a horrific disaster.  Seriously, there were so many serious developments in this film that I was constantly cracking up at inappropriate times.  Some just unbelievably silly stuff.  The filmmakers had high hopes here but really created a monster turd.<br /><br />The problems with this film start from the onset and just metamorphosize from there.  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are never too convincing as the top-notch genetic scientists.  It's not really their fault though, as this script makes them out more like underground hobo science nerds.  They drive a ramshackle 70's Gremlin and live in a cruddy apartment.  I guess with the bad economy they were forced to take their jobs making minimum wage.<br /><br />So these two drastically underpaid researchers have fun splicing and dicing around in the billion dollar lab they work at.  They make an incredible medical breakthrough as they create a new life form.  The wormy creatures they conjour up look like cute little Tremors babies.  These slimy little buggers are strangely interesting, but really amount to nothing more than a scientific stepping stone.<br />The two genius gene doctors realize they are on the edge of something so much more.  With visions of possible cures for Alzheimer's disease or cancer, they want to incorporate human DNA into their experiments.  Unfortunately their boss shuts down this plan real quick.  So not fair.<br />Well, this doesn't slow the mad scientists from their medical pursuits.  Heck, it's for the benefit of mankind.  Luckily the pharmaceutical company pays little attention to their work or the resources they use.  So they buckle down for the rest of the night and are able to create a new half-human life form named Dren.  Boo-yah!  Dren rapidly develops some breasts and a lethal stinger tail, causing all sorts of unexpected problems.<br /><br />I really thought this story sped through all the scientific developments way too fast, making this questionable outcome even more implausible.  The making of Dren seemed way too easy.  Not to mention the fact that keeping this mutant baby a secret was way too far-fetched.  Still, at this point the story was holding my interest.  It was not until the couple smuggle their creation out of the lab that it reaches new levels of absurdity.<br />Dren's new home is in an abandoned farmhouse.  Instead of running more tests on this creature, both of the doctors become emotionally attached to their project.  Hugs, kisses, dressing it(her?)up, applying makeup, teaching Dren to slow dance...it gets so dang preposterous.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but the nonsense here gets even more shockingly bizarre and flat-out stupid.  So many ludicrous moments, this movie derails like a bad train wreck. I couldn't help but glare at the screen with utter disgust and disbelief.  SPLICE has a very interesting premise, as it juggles scientific discovery with ethics and consequences.  I also enjoy seeing the horror genre receive critical acclaim.<br /><br />But I can't hop on this goofy, deranged bandwagon.  It violates a very serious genre of sci-fi horror with unforgivable missteps.  I'm telling you, it's bad, bad, BAD!  SPLICE has high aspirations but ends up being unintentionally funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play superstar geneticists with a knack for splicing DNA from diverse species to create new hybrids that can be used for pharmaceuticals.

Even so, I won't be recommending it to anyone I don't know closely, because it's out there and isn't what most people will be expecting - especially based on its trailer.<br /><br />If you're envisioning Species, you may be let down. If you're thinking Alien; you could be disappointed. It does however; lie somewhat in-between those two great films. And it's also sprinkled with a hint of the sort of family drama you'd find in The Jerry Springer show. I know - I just lost half of you there, didn't I? Still interested? Okay, keep reading.<br /><br />Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play Clive and Elsa; scientists as well as lovers. We quickly move on and accept that their employers are either blind to the fact, or don't seem to care that they are beyond fraternizing. A good deal of the film rests on the shoulders of the merit of their relationship, and their on-screen allure makes those portions believable as well as entertaining; mostly by Adrien Brody. He's such a likeable guy, and a terrific actor.<br /><br />I'll admit Splice takes it's time getting to the point, but I was never bored with it. The - `two characters in a room for prolonged periods of time' approach was handled with care; and there is a very subtle hint of `what the hell is gonna happen?' - teasing those hairs on the back of our necks for the first 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />After advisors shut down their project, Clive and Elsa secretly push forward with their experiment of splicing animal and human DNA. There must be some kind of strict Hollywood code in Sci-Fi movies, that forces the writers to script the purpose for DNA splicing to involve `the better of mankind', because it's seems like that's always the reason. It is here too.<br /><br />If you're not asleep by the end of act one, you may enjoy seeing the creature Clive and Elsa have well... spliced. I've certainly never seen anything like it, and was astronomically impressed. A blend of some barely visible CGI and beautiful make-up effects and voila; an original movie monster at last! The actress they hire to play the thing soon named Dren (Delphine Chaneac), does an amazing job at making her convincing, interesting and somehow even slightly attractive.<br /><br />If you think you can predict where this film is headed, you may be surprised. It is essentially three films in one; each act taking a sharp turn into something else. Several viewers will despise the third act entirely. While it wasn't my first choice of destinations for the film to take me to, I wouldn't say I had the worst time with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>When I saw the preview for Splice, the first thing that came to my mind was that the movie looked like kind of a rip-off of that 1995 movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9RB9E">Species</a> that Natasha Henstridge walks around in half naked. And while there are indeed some major similarities between Splice and Species, I think that Splice Director Vincenzo Natali actually had another movie in mind when he wrote this movie.<br /><br />Back in the early 1930s if you were to play God and try to create life how would you do it? We'll, you'd do some grave robbing and try to bring back the dead with a little lightening, right? How else? Because cloning and gene splicing in the 30s was a concept as distant as an iPhone. It's so much easier today. Just take some animal DNA and mix it with a little human DNA, throw it in a Petri dish, incubate, let sit then voil&agrave;. It's alive....It's alive!!!<br /><br />Splice's Dr. Frankensteins are Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley respectfully as Clive and Elsa. (Get it? Colin Clive played the original Dr. Frankenstein and Elsa Lanchester was 1935's Bride.) Clive and Elsa are geneticists and they create their own Frankenstein and call her Dren. Being only half human, Dren has some superior physical powers and--who knew?--introduce a little animal (or bird?) DNA to a human sample and you get a more intelligent being as well. So look out: a stronger, intelligent life form could be hazardous to your health.<br /><br />I'm surprised that there are so many 1 star reviews for Splice on this page, because the movie isn't really that bad at all. Sure the movie deals with controversial topics, and Dren gets down and dirty with her makers in both a consenting (bestiality?) and non-consenting (rape) way. But questionable opinions and hard to watch sex scenes aside, I was entertained by Splice. There are times when you'll hear yourself saying, "That would never happen," or "No one would ever really do that," but the movie never gets boring.<br /><br />Splice is certainly no Frankenstein classic, but it is a pretty good Sci-fi flick and I'd recommend it to any fan of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>The best horror films don't merely provide lots of gore and bloodletting, but tap into the primal fears of human beings, as well as the darkest parts of human nature. "Splice" does just that.<br /><br />Audience reactions seem to be mixed to "Splice", and it's easy to see why. "Splice" is really more of an art film that has more in common with David Cronenberg's films than mainstream horror fare like the "Saw" franchise. The film even stars Sarah Polley, an indie film fixture.<br /><br />Polley plays Elsa, who, along with her husband and fellow geneticist Clive (Adrian Brody), create a human/animal hybrid in secret, who they later name Dren ("nerd" spelled backwards, a cute way of the two embracing their science geek status). As in all horror films, playing with mother nature turns out to have disastrious consequences.<br /><br />Although films have long been using this basic plot that goes all the way back to "Frankenstein," what elevates "Splice" is its great script and acting. Elsa and Clive's relationship, which is both collaborative and competitive, facilitates the whole nightmare, as well as Elsa's tragic backstory as an abused, rural kid.<br /><br />What steals the show, however, is Dren. The film manages to make the creature both childlike, animalistic, and freakishly sexual, which is not only disarming for the audience, but leads to the disturbing plot developments in the film's controversial last act.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Well. I had high hopes for this film, and it started off with a lot of promise. But it turned out to be less of a sci fi film and more of a thriller with several badly-executed plot twists.<br /><br />I must warn you though, my review contains spoilers, so do not read if you don't want to be spoiled, though I personally think you might be better off if you do actually read, because this movie was hard to take seriously and was a waste of my time. Okay? You have been warned. So anyway the movie starts off great. You got two cute, nerdy scientists (the whole lab doesn't look that professional, this is not a huge lab with white-blue lights and everything. This lab seems to be more underground, and everyone dresses like hippies/hobos/emos under their lab coats, so I'm guessing they're not that well-paid despite the importance of their splicing work.<br /><br />It seems impossible that no one in the lab would find out about the experiment, but I guess it really is an underground lab with less supervision. However, it remains implausible.<br /><br />Dren's growth is inconsistent and this movie does not focus much on her growth except for a couple of 'miracles' like breathing underwater or learning how to spell. But she does not speak, even though she displayed that ability at the end of the movie. Then she gets smuggled out, and I'm thinking that 'Dad' was right to have wanted to destroy the experiment in the first place even though he changed his mind later.<br /><br />Actions and reactions make no sense. Dren's intelligence and learning growth remain inconsistent as if the writers didn't care about it. Later it is revealed that Dren has Elsa's DNA. How is that possible when the ova donated was a Jane Doe? Unless she got one out of herself, but whatever. When Elsa takes the cat away, there is no logic behind this, as Dren was just fine and comfortable with the cat and was obviously not sick. Dren obviously mourns for the cat, but she just sits there with her arms stretched out rather than grabbing the cat back or fighting for it. When Elsa returns the cat, Dren kills it with her tail. This makes no sense.<br /><br />What Dren did with Dad... I TOTALLY saw this coming ever since little Dren saw Mommy and Daddy together that one night. So it was absolutely no surprise.<br /><br />I don't know what the heck was up with Fred and Ginger. I mean, bam, Ginger changing and then the two of them fighting and having enough strength to actually unscrew the bolt to their cage? Really? Are you serious?<br /><br />And then just when you think it can't get any more ridiculous, Dren 'evolves' AGAIN and this time she... er, he does to Mom what he-she did to Dad. I was stunned at this horrible plot twist. The scene added NOTHING to the story. And then bam, at the end of the movie, you probably guessed what happened to Mom before they showed her stomach. And then going back to the research facility and just... the ending was horrible. It's astonishing that a movie with so much promise turned out to be so disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>There's not a breathtaking amount of originality to Splice, but it is an otherwise solid little sci-fi horror with no real lasting appeal. It's very similar to the incredibly stupid 1995 movie Species as well as having many shades of Guillermo Del Toro's Mimic (Del Toro served as producer on this film too) but plays it straight enough for it to be taken seriously in its own right.<br /><br />Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley play scientists/lovers working for a pharmaceutical company hoping to find cures for various diseases by splicing human DNA with that of various other creatures. They eventually create Dren, a female born from a fake uterus who initially looks like a blind, hairless rabbit. She soon grows arms and eyes and resembles a little girl, quickly after that she looks like a young woman and is treated mostly as a human, mostly.<br /><br />What bothered me about the film is that Dren is frequently treated pretty badly. She cannot talk, instead relying on squeaks and facial expressions, and should be treated like the newborn she actually is. But the pretty poor scientists who created her really ought to be charged with animal/human cruelty. If repeatedly slapping a bad dog with a newspaper creates an unstable animal...<br /><br />Splice doesn't really have many tricks up its sleeve. Vincenzo Natali plays the dead/not dead card way too many times and never really lets us into the mind of Dren. When the movie isn't trying to be a horror its an interesting study of the would-be human development of Dren and the emotions she provokes from those around her. In the end, neither genre defines the film and, like Dren herself, it ends up being a hodge-podge of half-baked ideas.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>I love creepy horror movies that mix in some good science-fiction conceit - like The Fly.  But this nauseating movie queasily offers up a modern Frankenstein story that goes places you don't want to go.  Dren, the hybrid hottie, is inconsistent as a creature - she sometimes looks as real as can be, and at other moments looks like an old-fashioned claymation figure.  There are rare glimmers of wit and comedy (in the naming of the other mutant "children"; in the film noir performance of the French billionaire fundress) - but nothing ever comes of it. Sure, Adrien Brody has never looked better, but c'mon - the truth is, SPLICE is one big yuck.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>First, you get the impression that Rush Limbaugh and his right wing wackos have concocted the onslaught on genetic engineering. Somewhere in the corner of an abandoned laboratory, two scientists, who happened to be a husband and wife (and the man's brother also a scientist working in the same laboratory, as if it was mail-room family business) embarked on a rouge research by inserting human genes into an experimental animal cell line.  You quickly imagine Limbaugh broadcasting that the newly engineered deformed monster engaged in sex with both the man and his wife, killed the man, and got the wife pregnant. The woman scientist is now carrying the new species in her belly, like Adam and Eve in their creation of the Homo sapiens.<br /><br />Off course, there are many scientists who could sell their soul to the devil, but the idea that creating a monster by genetic engineering is both immature and illogical. Even though history proves that genes could make up for all combinations of creatures, from dinosaurs to mosquitoes, the overnight creation of a genetically engineered monster, reared and incarcerated in an abandoned farm, is quite a stretch.  A more probable stretch though is making such monster in a military biological laboratory in a manner that could replace Iron Man in its ability to fly, walk, swim, dive, dodge bullets, and destroy the enemies of the state.<br /><br />The movie however kept me scared, tense, and engaged.  I could imagine the easy slipping into a slippery slope of two motivated scientists who view their scientific mission superseding all state laws and regulations.  It has long been known to scientists that the states are always oppressing to new ideas, since Galileo opposed the belief that the Earth was the center of the universe.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>I found Splice to be much more than the 'Species' 'clone' some folk have dubbed it. At least in this film, we can empathize with the poor creature, Dren. I will agree that the acting of the scientist couple is a bit melodramatic and over-the-top... but in the film's defense, genius is often earmarked with strange behavior. In this light, the film shines as a modern day Frankenstein. And believe me when I say that coming from me, that is very high praise indeed.<br /><br />But I can simply wax on the praise when it comes to these reviews. Often, I get slammed for being objective. But there's no objectivity needed in the second half of a BD review: the special features. Specifically, the lack thereof. There is a 35 minute 'spliced' together behind the scenes that doesn't follow any sort of index for contents - it's just kinda there. There first couple of minutes is actually filming the filming, an artsy-feeling thing that you pray isn't the whole feature. And it isn't. The highlights are Adrien Brody cutting up between takes and the girls who actually do the performance of Dren, especially the little girl that plays baby-Dren. Surprisingly, none of the Dren footage is 100% CGI. If we had more special features or even just a commentary track, this review would be a five-star opinion.<br /><br />But as the director states - this is the monster movie he's never seen. And that is a spot-on synopsis, and it is at the end of the day the reason I enjoyed the film as much as I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>Two scientists have been fusing the genes of humans with other living beings, trying to create a new species.

Very well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This movie is disturbing, so disturbing that it raises all kinds of issues. It is so controversial that if you are insecure about your sexuality it might make you angry.  There's sex change in this one, theirs violence and mutant lab experiments, their sex and other things with animal person. Yes, this one inspires alot of violent reactions from some people. They say the acting is poor even! but it's not , the acting is fine, well done even. It's just that they can't handle this movie. So ignore the one star reviews that harp on acting, the fact is that the acting is fine here. THe effects are great here the morality of these scientists is not so good perhaps but this is a sci fi movie so just sit back and enjoy the ride. Anyways the blu ray looks stunning and this being a modern movie should be no less than that. It's worth getting on blu ray so grab this one while you can before the angry reviews burn all the copies! after all calling this the worst movie ever is silly! They should watch the many truly bad no budget movies I have seen! that are one star affairs to most reviewers but you can't judge them on a regular scale , this one you can , it's a big budget movie and a good sci fi film that will disturb many viewers and is not suitable for kids at all.  But it is for sci fi fans like me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>On the cutting edge of science, things are now becoming possible that used to be only the province of tales like Dr. Moreau and Frankenstein.  And in the highly authentic-feeling "Splice", the central question is, as it has been in many great tales from at least "Frankenstein" onward: with this power, will humanity be able to distinguish between the issues of "what can and can't be done" and "what Should and Shouldn't" be done?<br /><br />  Two scientists, excellently played by Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody, are in the field of splicing genes from different species into one another to create new lifeforms.  Though there's a question right and there about ethics, at least the motivations are noble - trying to find cures from disease through new biochemicals, etc.  There's a striking but believable self-contradiction in the main characters right there: though they seem attached and even, at times, almost parental in their feelings toward these hybrids, they have no emotional or ethical objection against just how they use these creatures in pursuit of their goals, or in disposing of them when it comes to that.  It's when the pair goes against all guidelines and laws by adding human DNA into the mix that things get taken to a much higher level.<br /><br />  The result of the human-animal splice is Dren, a strange little creature that in its infancy appears alternately comical and deadly.  The researchers are initially prepared to destroy the hybrid - they never intended to let it get past the stage of an early embryo, then destroy it there and research the remains.  But among Dren's wonderous physical properties is a phenomenally fast growth rate, and by its birth that growth rate is already spinning things out of control.  Finding themselves unable to kill a newborn hybrid with human DNA and some human characteristics, they hide Dren's existance from their peers and begin to study her.  They bond quickly with Dren, with Polley's character first assuming a distinctly mother-like role to the fast-growing Dren.  As Dren grows, she becomes extremely intelligent, and the bonds within the group start to take on very disturbing overtones.<br /><br />  Like the Frankenstein creation, Dren - who contains not only human DNA but genes from a whole battery of creatures including scorpions, birds, amphibians, and heaven knows what else - is both the movie's "monster" and its victim.  The horror escalates - not in a "the world's going to end tomorrow" kind of way, but in a manner that sees everything going to hell in a handbasket within the main group of characters, and slowly starting to spiral out to those around them.  Among the movie's most potent fright weapons is the disturbingly plausible feeling it has - that eventually, somebody, somewhere, will go and do something like this, if for no other reason than to prove that they can.  And that the results might be just as unpredictable and ghastly as they are here.<br /><br />  Great special effects and a plot that takes classic themes and moves them into even more twisted territory add to the whole.  Great movie, nine out of ten.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>The study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature.<br />- An excerpt from "The Island of Dr. Moreau" by H.G. Wells<br /><br />The problem is, lovers and genetic scientists Clive and Elsa (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) don't know this. At least, they don't know this at first. Just like Dr. Moreau, it's all in the name of scientific progress and the belief that it will somehow benefit humanity. Their methods are, initially, totally objective; by splicing together the DNA of various animals, they create entirely new hybrid species, hoping to extract a gene that would provide protein and other necessary components for the sick and dying. They succeed, although they would like to go one step further and experiment with human DNA. Their company, while successful, will not provide any more funding, for Clive and Elsa's other hybrids are developing quickly enough to be marketed as visionary products of scientific research.<br /><br />Not content with being held back, Elsa secretly introduces some human DNA into an assortment of other genes. Clive is wary; not only are they breaking the rules of the company, they're also toying with a host of ethical issues. Elsa remains confident. After all, she doesn't want to bring the new species to term. She just wants to see if it can be done. The thing is, the new life form grows at an advanced rate and emerges before it can be terminated. It's a strange although not altogether unlikeable creature, a female with a bulbous head and spindly legs and a tail. Elsa takes a liking to her immediately and names her Dren, which is the reverse of "nerd," in this case not a putdown but an acronym for the name of their genetic corporation. Clive thinks it was a gigantic mistake. Regardless, they have essentially become parents, and they do whatever they can to keep Dren safe from prying eyes.<br /><br />The greatest achievement of "Splice" is that, up until the ending, director Vincenzo Natali was ambitious enough to make it be more than a mere thriller. It's an absorbing blend of science fiction and philosophy, forcing both the characters and the audience into a number of thought provoking moral quandaries. Like Wells' "Dr. Moreau," it intelligently raises concern over the pursuit of scientific progress while at the same time begging the question of what distinguishes animals from humans, if indeed there is anything to distinguish. In a matter of months, Dren evolves from a child (Abigail Chu) into full maturity (Delphine Chaneac); although she becomes progressively more humanoid in appearance, she has very clear animalistic tendencies, some of which are quite dangerous. And yet, her emotional development is much the same as that of a human girl - curious about what her "parents" forbid, mindful of her changing appearance, and, most interestingly, becoming aware of her sexuality.<br /><br />The film also presents us with a look at Clive and Elsa, who seem caught in that unendurable gray zone between cold analysis and emotional attachment. Elsa is especially fascinating, drawn to the methodical and objective nature of science but also harboring deep-seeded maternal instincts, in large part because her own mother didn't seem to possess any. Did she grow to love what started out as a cloning experiment, or did she deliberately create Dren for reasons other than scientific advancement? If it's the former, did she honestly believe anything different would happen? If it's the latter, what did she hope to get out of it emotionally and how did she think it would work? As for Clive, his reluctance belies a curious connection with Dren, one that may seem reprehensible but, given his relationship with Elsa, is also somehow justifiable.<br /><br />Considering how compelling most of the movie is, it's a shame Natali opted for such a generic climax, the morally challenging aspects disregarded in favor of a routine monster-movie showdown. I can't help but wonder if there's an alternate ending strewn amongst the scraps on the cutting room floor, for it's hard to believe that a conclusion this manufactured was what the filmmakers had in mind. Up until then, we were actually being tested. We were actively engaging in a stimulating cinematic debate. I will admit that there's a satisfying air of mystery in the final shot, one that proves Wells' point: The study of Nature makes a man (or a woman) at last as remorseless as Nature. Still, the scene is hardly worthy of the events leading up to it, which are so well done that I simply can't look past them. In spite of the disappointing final act, "Splice" is an above average science fiction film, strong in character and tone, gripping in plot, and stimulating as a study of ethics.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The premise of Splice is pretty simple. Two scientists looking for a cure to mankind's most horrid diseases, mix human DNA in their splicing of animal genes. Instead of killing their creation, they decide to raise it. Then the you know what hits the fan. It's basically a better version of the the film Species. I know one features a really hot alien from space and this creature is created in the lab, but it has that same sexy vibe. You can tell the director, Vincenzo Natali, who also directed the cult favorite, Cube, really tried to make the audience feel uncomfortable with a few really twisted scenes. I was expecting something a little more shocking after reading some reviews, but perhaps watching Spartacus: Blood and Sand has left little room for surprise, at least for me.<br /><br />The movie relies on three performances and they are all very good. Other than the fact I find Adrien Brody hard to look at, he and Sarah Polley play the roles so seriously, you can't help but believe every word they say. There are a few situations where they do typical dumb things, but the dialogue and acting were believable most of the time. The creature named Dren, which looks more human than animal and ages rapidly, is a fantastic design. The early stages of it's life are all done with CGI, which is the least convincing, but once it hits the teen years, Delphine Chan&eacute;ac, takes over and really breathes some life into the character. Dren has odd shaped hands, legs and feet, no hair, communicates by squeaking, sprouts wings at will, has a long tail with a sharp tip, and has eyes set as far apart as possible while still remaining on the front of her face. Oh, and her name is nerd spelled backwards.<br /><br />The gore is really kept to a minimum. I thought there would be a little more red being thrown around than what you would see in a PG-13 movie. I won't spoil it, but there is a very weird sex scene and even a quick scene of rape towards the end, that got this film an R rating, along with the language. There was more violence and gore in Drag Me to Hell. I also didn't like the last 15 minutes that much. It felt a little rushed and turned into nothing more than a typical creature feature.<br /><br />Splice is not a great horror film, but it's a pretty good one, that shouldn't be missed once it hits Blu-ray.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>It cannot be said enough, whether in film or books, that experimenting with certain aspects of Mother Nature can produce catastrophic problems with unconscionable consequences. So enter "Splice" into that select pantheon of stories that provoke life-altering, ethical consideration with a loud, clanging warning.<br /><br />I don't much care for Adrien Brody as an actor, didn't know Sarah Polley, but did recognize the Monster element from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1897093519">Frankenstein (Qualitas Classics)</a> and was thus hooked. In fact, it's the tailed creature shown in promos which drew me to the film in the first place. You know humans have the physical structure to have had a tail at one point. That tail develops into an interesting part of the creature's anatomy, plus its bird-like physiognomy and its amphibious lungs. Evolution compacted into one beautiful creature.<br /><br />Yet, every time, whether on the page or in celluloid, let someone experiment with the human element and see what you get. Every time. As one who had taught "Frankenstein" in high school English classes, I was pulled into viewing the film despite potential silliness often wrought in such films. Instead, I was absolutely mesmerized, so much so, that after the film ended--very open-ended, I might add--I watched again and picked up nuances I missed the first time.<br /><br />So, what was so mesmerizing? The idea of splicing human DNA with animal DNA? Enter Dr. Moreau and his entourage of misshapened critters. How about re-animating a creature with component human parts? Yes, Mary Shelley told us about those problems and the pathos of the creature who merely craves acceptance and love. Or Robin Cook's half-human, half-monkey in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425161242">Chromosome 6</a> with the brain to speak and think and feel, but physiognomy that required being locked out of sight. However, the Greeks warned us extensively about hubris--that pointedly selfish human element that permeates and poisons human history, both individually and collectively. All these problems merge and re-emerge in "Splice."<br /><br />Elsa, half of this couple, both in the lab and in the bedroom, and Clive, her partner, have produced blobs with the potential of using the DNA proteins of future genetic experiments (new creatures with human DNA) to correct human ills, like MS, cancer, and the like. The pharmaceutical company that underwrites their expenses encourages them to do so. However, the grossly effective scene in which Fred and Ginger (the DNA "monsters") horrifies their scientific audience by engaging, not in paramour, but in vicious, to-the-death battle, sets up the second half of the story. Although this scene, protested by some as unnecessary, is, indeed, required because it provides important foreshadowing in horrific plot development to come. Unequivocably.<br /><br />And so we have "Splice," not simply an entertainment, but a violent commentary on going beyond, eating that denied fruit of the untouchable tree--and, of course, it is the woman who violates all protocol to create something new. Once she breaks the rules--all sorts of rules: common sense, ethical, scientific, religious--there is no going back, no undoing. Oh, yes, excuse me. Clive does try to kill their creation. Yet, once this new species lives, he will, inevitably, step beyond another boundary and taste completely this new fruit. Consequences? Just as in the biblical story: No more garden, no more eternal life, then just problems, problems, and more problems.<br /><br />Remember <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA0">Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)</a> and all the dialog that resulted for weeks and weeks afterward? "Splice" is definitely one of those films.<br /><br />(Note: Really surprising is how good the animation is. In fact, the creature early on looks so real that I kept looking for some clue as to technique, some little slip to show the creature was indeed not real. Nothing looks phony or tacky. The creature's realism lends serious credence to the plot and the film as a serious entity.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Splice really seemed liked it would be a sleeper hit. The sci-fi horror film has an incredible cast, it's produced by Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro, and early reviews were extremely positive. The insinuated enjoyment factor and entertainment value for the film were already expected to be fairly high considering the people involved and critical response. Let's just say the film is probably a bit more eccentric than you may be expecting.<br /><br />Right off the bat, you'll notice the similarities between Splice and Species since they both deal with a female creature that is a result of the splicing of human DNA with something inhuman. Trying to keep this creature in a contained environment cut off from the rest of the world is really only the first half of the film. The second half is pretty unfamiliar territory.<br /><br />Not many films (or any really) have been able to leave me speechless after viewing them. Splice came pretty close. The film leaves you with this inconclusive sense of indecisiveness. The story piques your interest and is able to hold onto it throughout the duration of the film while the main cast gives nothing but strong performances, but the film's content in the latter half is what will make or break your opinion of it. Obviously I'm trying to avoid spoilers, but let's just say you'll never look at Adrien Brody the same way again after seeing him in this.<br /><br />Splice's strongest assets are the the fact that it's fairly unpredictable and incredibly intriguing. Once it takes that left turn at Albuquerque, its ending is a bit predictable (and open-ended). The human interaction with the CG version of Dren when she first hatches is pretty impressive though. You may be able to tell that baby Dren is CG, but the performances from Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley make it believable. Be sure to see this in the theater, as well. The reaction this film gets from a packed movie theater audience is priceless. As a last word of advice, don't expect a bloodbath. There's one bloody scene in the whole film. The rest is pretty tame when it comes to gore. Whether you like it or hate it, most can probably agree that Splice is the most unusual horror film of 2010.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I liked the movie SPLICE, but I'm not sure I would ever recommend it to anyone.  It's a horror movie that walks very tightly on the line between irredeemably silly and truly creepy.  For me, it fell on the creepy side just enough to make it a fun experience.  But based on some of the very low audience scores I've seen, it easily falls on the laughable side for many.<br /><br />It tells the story of two scientists who are a couple (Adrien Brody & Sarah Polley) who work for a big conglomerate that seeks to develop a new source of animal protein, or something like that.  They are literally developing new life forms that look like giant slugs and apparently will make for truly outstanding sources of protein.  For reasons not entirely clear and/or credible...they add just a smidge of human DNA to the recipe (without permission from anyone , of course) and end up with a hybrid that starts out as a painfully ugly creature that looks like a lumpy slug with stump legs, but eventually grows into a slender, mostly human looking female (except for the wide side eyes) that has some characteristics that aren't entirely human, nor are they entirely safe.<br /><br />Modest mayhem ensues in this film that is really yet another modern update of the Frankenstein story.  In fact, the two main characters are named Clive and Elsa...could that be Colin Clive, who played the original Dr. Frankenstein and Elsa Lancaster, who played the original Bride of Frankenstein?  Regardless, Clive and Elsa are two of the most irresponsible scientists to grace a movie.  Their experimentation is reckless in the extreme (and probably pointless too).  At first, Brody is horrified by the creature his partner as spawned, and wants to destroy it and pretend none of it happened...but love and fear of his partner stop him.  Gradually, roles reverse as the creature (named "Dren"...which is "nerd" backwards) develops a personality along with a strong, dangerous will of its own.<br /><br />If it all sounds silly...that's because it IS very silly on paper.  But for me, the film worked to an extent by embracing the "wrongness" of what these two scientists were doing.  I was filled with dread at nearly every turn by the casual disregard for scientific principles and the truly yucky looking creature.  The beast was "wrong,"...just looking at it, you knew that a thing like this was never meant to exist.<br /><br />As Dren grows up and learns to express itself in more recognizable ways...we do grow to take an interest in her well-being...but only up to a point, because she has a mean streak that's rather alarming too.  And she keeps changing throughout the movie, so you really have no idea what to expect next.  Dren is a pretty cool Frankenstein monster, as it turns out.<br /><br />The film also works because of Sarah Polley.  As she did for the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, Polley brings a serious, grounded approach to her acting.  She never once appears to acknowledge the far-fetched nature of that she's doing...but she tries to act her character as though she was a super-smart, egotistical but still flesh-and-blood person, not just some screenwriter's concoction.  Her character is given some silly things to do and say, but what Polley does is emphasize the believable parts of the script, embrace the character arc she is given, and she plows through the silly stuff, making it matter far less.  Brody is fine as well...although I wouldn't say he quite brings the same gravity to his portrayal.  Sarah Polley is used far too little in films...probably because she isn't a conventional "Hollywood beauty."  Instead, she comes across as a real person you might actually meet.  I find that refreshing.  The movie itself is shot in a color palette that is all winter colors, adding to the grimy nature of the proceedings.<br /><br />The special effects are passable but not great.  The story has a conventional, even predictable ending scene that steals a lot of its impact.  But faults aside, I also found I could not look away from the compellingly icky SPLICE.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This attempts to be serious hard scifi, but there is something about the film as a whole that simply fails.  The script is all over the place.  On the one hand, it tries to be a kind of morality tale, raising questions about the ethics of scientists seeking their brand of truth.  You have a couple - the woman pushing ahead, the guy doubting and ultimately letting her do what she wants - who debate things in a wooden dialogue that doesn't go far enough.  Brody kind of yells out his concerns in certain situations, but doesn't hesitate to make love to the creature later.  The scientists do an illegal, dangerous experiment in secret, using the facilities of their company to pursue their own designs, with startling results.  On the other hand, they create a monster and it becomes a life-and-death struggle, etc.  Here it more or less fits into a formula:  fascination, revulsion, fear, then violence a la Frankenstein.  Oh, and an amoral corporation is bankrolling the whole thing.<br /><br />It would have succeeded better if the chemistry between the stars - Brody and Polley - somehow played better on screen, but I just couldn't believe them - that they were in love, that they were geniuses, that they had some higher, if mistaken, purpose in mind.  Brody is much better than Polley, whom I had never seen before and think gives a mediocre and inconsistent performance.  This failure is the crux of the film's failure, in my view.<br /><br />A lot of it is unbearably grotesque and ridiculously overdone.  There is one scene where these invented members of a new species square off and turn eachother into oozing pulp for incomprehensible reasons.  It is bad enough that it had to be so disgusting, but they did it (surprise!) at a demonstration in a shareholders' meeting, which just isn't believable.  A similar thing happens with the monster, of course, who also turns out to be based in human part on the DNA of the female scientist.<br /><br />I think one of the best things in the film is the monster.  Her character is subtle and an evolving enigma, the effects are flawlessly realistic, at least in a visual sense.  I did find her perfection as an organism a bit much, but that is a problem only for the serious hard scifi buff.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this as a viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Oh, those pesky outside-the-box scientists.  Give them a chance and they'll cut, splice, and dice DNA combos until they wind up with something that looks like Lady Gaga's meat costume--yet it can do your taxes.  And ethics?  Ethics schmethics.  We've got deadly diseases to cure!  Where's that test tube that had the ostrich bullion amino acids?  Over there, next to the cornish hen hamster.<br /><br />Thus we establish the premise of SPLICE, an out-of-control belly wobbler about a pair of geneticists who create first two globs of liver spot punching bags, then add human DNA to this mix and create. . .well, something between what you find in a bucket of KFC and what you slip a dollar bill to at the strip pole.  As we all know, the mutant is going to run amuck and cause massive carnage, and that our two scientists (Adrien Brody, who needs a meal, and Sarah Polley, who needs a valium) are going to face ethical and moral dilemmas that will challenge the foundation of whatever the nature of their relationship is.  Delphine Chaneac plays Dren, the creature, and when she's not sprouting wings or flicking a poison-tipped tail she's making noises akin to my accountant after a bottle of Wellers.  Sure turn-ons for Brody--that naughty scientist.<br /><br />We even come across a Brody clone in Brandon McGibbon, who plays Brody's brother, so SPLICE is actually Adrien Brody squared, which should be scary, but like everything else in this howler it's not.  I don't know why I give two stars to a horror movie I enjoyed so much it made me laugh all the way through; maybe it was the liver spot punching bags.  Call PETA.<br />--D.

I watched the last part of it on HBO and was intrigued as to how a DNA splicing could produce a creature that appeared to be 70% woman, 15% cat, 5% rabbit and 10% bird.  I watched and even rewatched the first part of the film but must admit that the science was a bit thin.  Of course, this is characteristic of all Science-Horror films.<br /><br />My guess is that, if it were possible to 'splice' all these species together, it would look a lot like the slugs that these brilliant scientists originally produced.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>FICTION?

'Splice' does what so many other horror films try to do and fail, it actually evokes fear! Watching this film today, I can only imagine the shock Frankenstein had on the movie going public back in 1931. This film is shocking, controversial and will certainly put some viewers off with its themes of blasphemy, bestiality, incest and rape! I had to deduct one star because the two scientist were incredibly stupid and the film just couldn't seem to shake it's "monster on the loose" origins in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>At first sight, "Splice" (Dark Castle being its co-production company) belongs to the minor genre, namely a sci-fi film about brilliant (and often misguided) scientists doing some morally debatable experiments. As you know, the subject matter has been treated in films countless times since Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, but "Splice" directed by Vincenzo Natali ("Cube") attempts to give some emotional depths to the overused topic. "Splice" is not just a sci-fi thriller. Well, the trouble is, whatever "Splice" wants to be, the film looks very silly.<br /><br />Two maverick scientists Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) hired by a pharmaceutical company that wants a new medicine have made a groundbreaking invention: a totally new life form. The genetically engineered "creature" (named "Dren") looks like a human with a long tail. Here is an opportunity for ethical debate or "Species"-like campy horrors. Instead of them, Natali's "Splice" tries to focus the fragile relationships between the scientists and its subject, or something more disturbing.<br /><br />So far, the film is not bad. The special effects are also decent. The problem is, in order to make its point the film ignores details that are essential to building up believable characters. It is painful watching characters (not just Clive and Elsa), who should be enough intelligent to discuss moral dilemma, making stupid decisions over and over again. Those scientists don't even know what they really want. The company is so sloppy in managing their "properties" on which they must have spent millions of dollars. So why should we take the film seriously?<br /><br />It is even more painful watching talented actors playing unbelievable characters exchanging silly dialogs. But the greatest problem is that "Splice" is predictable and boring. Once you get the drift of the story, you know where it is going, and it is exactly what happens in the muddled third act.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>From Vincenzo Natali, the director of the original Cube, Splice is a curious offspring of horror and science gone wrong.  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as two brilliant scientists whose experimentation with cross-breeding various brands of DNA result the creation of "Dren", whose rapid growth results in a devilishly and strangely seductive form (played by Delphine Chaneac).  For most of its running time, Splice is a thought provoking horror/thriller that delivers some genuine shocks and surprises, and is made all the better thanks to the performances of Brody and Polley.  Even Chaneac, though she never utters a word, makes what could be close to being a star-making turn as the monsterously sexy Dren.  Though it turns into a by-the-numbers chase towards the conclusion of the film, Splice is nevertheless entertaining and intelligent, and is more than worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>When working in a lab, you often find once-in-a-lifetime trials that make the work interesting. For the two doctors we have here, that is growing a combination of spliced animals, mating them, and then seeing what happens. The results seem promising, too, and they even give the good dostors a reason to continue. when they ask to put in human materials into the splicing salad, they are told they cannot and that Phase 2, basically finding ways to make money with this new stuff, was the way to go. Otherwise, it was shutdown city. Being doctors and seeing things the way people in lab coats sometimes do, this does not keep them from growing something.<br />And that something, Dren, is a lot more than they bargained for.<br /><br />When I first watch this movie, I felt like I had missed some of the horror.this had a lot of layers in it that spoke on a woman wanting a child, on a man finding himself in a very odd place, and perhaps even the idea of what happens when we make something that is way out-of-bounds when it comes to science and breakthroughs. That said, it did not seem to be terrifying. It had some moments, sure, and it seemed really well done on the CGI front. Honestly, the things that were made before "it" and the "it" itself was beautiful. I just expeced something different.<br /><br />The second time I watched it I saw a different movie altogether. I knew that I didn't need the horror I was loking for in the front so I looked for other things. and the other things were, at least, really terrible. When you think about the idea of taking pieces of a person and putting them into something for observation, that can be odd. But when it turns out to have dominate human traits and looks and seems like a person, that is different. The want to terminate the thing becomes wanting to kill, and that is a lot harder. Other things work their way into the loop as well - this is the first time it had been done and, accordingly, there were a lot of things that were unexpected. The attraction it could bring, the wings it could have, the capacity to grow and continue growing; in so many ways that was terrible. And when it finds meat, you can just tell that this might take things a whole different wsay.<br /><br />If you like horrible things on a subtle front, then you might like this. The commercials are not what they shot out there so you chould forget them and forcus on good acting, good CGI, nice storytelling and some unexpected twists. Also, look at how the thing acts when it is growing. You can see a lot of the humanity we hide there, not to mention the things we float to the front. To me, that earned it right on a 4, saying I liked it and would like it again.<br />I think more people would, too, if they knew what to expect ahead of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>I rather liked most of this film, with the exception of last 10 minutes, which were very weak and disappointing.<br /><br />I believe that it is hardly a SPOILER to say, that this film is basically about two genetists, Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley), colleagues, friends and lovers, who, after facing budget cuts decide to make an illegal experiment, by cloning a chimera made of a mixture of DNA from a human, animals and the DNA of a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO), a kind of huge worm, which they earlier (legally) created. The result of this illegal experiment will be a facinating quasi-human intelligent creature, a little girl, which with time, for reasons you have to discover yourself, they will call Dren (Delphine Chaneac). Some more limited SPOILERS ahead.<br /><br />Maybe it is because I have myself two young children, but rather than the SciFi elements I immediately rather focused on the child they brought to the world and what would become of her. Because they are afraid of consequences and still not certain if they will allow Dren to even live, Clive and Elsa hide her - and therefore ipso facto they keep her prisoner. Therefore, as far as my personal perception is concerned, this film is mostly about a little girl who was denied her childhood and who suffers for a extended period continuous abuse from her "parents" - or maybe rather should we call them her "abductors"?<br /><br />This is a sad film and a sad story and although Clive and Elsa try to bring some light into Dren's life, she nevertheless still lives in a prison, locked and watched by her gaolers. Being different from humans, she grows fast and as she enters the adolescence, she finally starts to rebel - as all adolescents do. And because of what she is, she has tools to rebel as no other adolescents have...<br /><br />This film is also a kind of study in double, mutual entrapment, because exactly as Dren is being kept under lock by her "parents", they are also stuck with her... Vincenzo Natali, who earlier made the quite impressive "Cube", leads this story very skillfully for almost the whole duration of the film and he rather intelligently describes Dren's late teens rebellion until a breaking point is reached and she severs her emotional links first with her "mother" and then, even more radically, with her "father". This liberation and coming of age (showed in a very Freudian scene between Dren and Clive) is quite beautifully symbolized by her deploying of wings... This final rebellion is also a punishment inflicted to both Clive and Elsa for their cowardly failure to provide the necessary love and care to the child they brought into this world...<br /><br />Sadly, at that moment the director took the film in the completely wrong direction and as the result, what could be a very honest SciFi philosphical tale, crashed and exploded in flames. The last 10 minutes of the film are horribly bad and do not make the slightest sense, at least as far as my personal taste is concerned. This is the reason, why I think this film desserves only three stars.<br /><br />But still, I do not regret that I watched it, as it has many touching moments and for most of its duration it is quite good. And it certainly touched me and made me think many times since about this little strange looking girl with a tail, living her sad, lonely existence locked in basements and barns. About Dren, who never got a chance...</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>Throughout most of its runtime, this audacious sci-fi flick benefits from fine performances, nuanced characterizations, credible CG and exceptional makeup. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as a married pair of accomplished yet marginalized genetic engineers who create a humanoid life form (Abigail Chu, Delphine Chan&eacute;ac) of rapid growth and unprecedented adaptability. Although the leads are undermined by sloppy and abrupt editing similar to that of a sneak preview cut during the film's first twenty minutes, their efforts are nonetheless complemented by first-rate effects in aid of an unnerving, compelling, knotty, sexy story that's most effective when reflecting the tensions and shifting sympathies of the wedded scientists in regard to their creation and one another. During the final fifteen minutes, these cultivated characters become disposable targets because neither director Vincenzo Natali nor his co-authors knew how to conclude their tale as thoughtfully as they developed it.

It can also be compared as a modern day "Frankenstein" where scientists mess with Mother Nature.<br /><br />In general I liked the movie.  However the film creates this interesting creature but focuses too much on the external elements of that act rather than on how she/he might evolve.  Still, you have to like it for some technically excellent filmmaking and a different sort of thriller.<br /><br />The Blu ray is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and transferred in 1080p.

The eventual result is a pseudo-humanoid they name Dren, that ends up looking sort of like a 21-year old Telly Savalas, but with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, ostrich legs, and a tail.  A slew of other genetic surprises and advantages as well.  Don't worry though, because the two were implausibly able to keep this genetic monstrosity a secret from everyone else in the lab.  So no problem.  Wink, wink.<br /><br />Up to this point the movie is exciting, interesting, and fairly original.

For some reason the hamster-chicken grows super-fast and the scientist begin raising it like a little girl, and before you know it blamm-o she's a young woman...with a poison filled stinger at the tip of her tail.<br /><br />There were just so many mis-steps in "Splice" it's difficult to just pinpoint where the movie veers off-course, but my guess would be when you first meet the two scientists in the opening scenes with their meat-sack creations, and by the time you see the little chicken-hamster thing, you can't help but start chuckling. What kind of scientists are these guys, the certainly aren't very good evil scientists, and they are not likable, and to top it off the they drive around in a 1970's era AMC Gremlin! Just poor judgement all aound.<br /><br />Also, on a side note. If you are making a horror film, at least try to make it somewhat scary. There is no tension, no suspense and no horror in "Splice"...well except for Adrian Brody's love-makin' face which we get to see twice unfortunately. Just a horrible film, that at times is laughable, but not in a good way. I recommend "Sharktopus" or "Dinocroc" instead. Sure they're bad, but they at least accomplish what they set out to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>This movie is such a super-collided atomic mess that it is hard to rate "Splice" with just a single star for how endearingly awful it is; and for that reason, it's almost tempting to give it five stars for being such a stunning screw-up. Obviously, someone had high-hopes for "Splice;" by casting Oscar winner Adrian Brody and handing it to up and coming director Vincenzo Natali (best known for cult science-fiction classic "The Cube"), "Splice" had a high concept and old fashioned B-Movie science fiction plot going for it. Brody and co-star Sarah Polley are the scientists who decide to ignore all the rules and go against those stuffy conventions that they get the scientific breakthrough they wanted. The bad news is: they get the scientific breakthrough they wanted.<br /><br />Yes, that's right. These ever so hip scientists (Brody wanders the lab with ironic t-shirts, there's Anime artwork in the couple's apartment) are genius DNA specialists that somehow match human DNA with amphibians, scorpions, birds and who knows what else to create Dren, which happens to be Nerd spelled backward. Like most science fiction monsters, Dren grows at a ridiculously fast pace, has super-human intelligence, childlike behavior and not much by way of moral turpitude. Of course, Brody and Polley soon lose all scientific objectivity regarding Dren and fall in love with their little monster, and that's when things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />While this might seem like boiler-plate science-fiction, "Splice" may be the first hipster Science Fiction movie. The best sci-fi/suspense/horror works when your monster somehow is an allegory for whatever the zeitgeist of the world is at the moment. "Splice" works that angle in that "Dren" begs us to consider what nasty creatures we may create if we start messing with Mother Nature, but soon starts going for new levels of irony. Before you know it, "Splice" is whipping questions of gender identity, circumcision, lust, love, parenting, rape and finally, the usual evil corporation profit mongers. With ever upping of the ante, as a viewer, you're left to wonder "did they really just go there?" The answer is yes, and the film just keeps on going. The final third of the movie is such a mess that you feel like you're watching the train wreck. It's not wretchedly bad (for that, you need "Alien Vs Predator" or "Battlefield Earth"), but "Splice" - which borrows so much from the likes of "Species," "Alien," "Prophecy" and even "Rosemary's Baby" that you may feel a bit of deja vu - will still leave you stunned.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>SPLICE<br /><br />I have to say that when this film first came out other than the crazy looking female in it I wasn't to into it. But of course tha changed when I actually got the chance to see it and my opinion turned around. Don't get me wrong I always wanted to see it but it was not a priority. This film actually turned out to be much better than I thought it would be, in fact I thought it would be just average. I was pleasantly surprise as I thought it was a great flick. Add in that Guillermo Del Toro had a hand in this and you have the potential for a great movie.<br /><br />Two scientists who are also together work at a company pushing the limits of DNA research; in fact they have created a new species by splicing animal genes together. When they put the new animals together [one male and one female] things go pretty good. But they want to take it a bit farther and add in human DNA to their next project. That of course gives birth to a humanoid like creature they name Dren, which of course is nerd backwards. Clive and Elsa {Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley} have different points of view on this new life form. Elsa views Dren as a daughter and wants to care for her while Clive wants the subject gone, but the views they each have change hands as Dren gets older.<br /><br />I thought this was absolutely a brilliant film especially the first ?'s of the film, the ending kinda went down a bit but it was still good. But everything before that was brilliant because Dren really did come off as a human female child. Going threw all the emotions and changes a girl would in real life. It is in this that the relationship between the three elevates this movie in my eyes. Things do get a little crazy here but I was kinda into it mainly because it felt real to me, I thought it moved along pretty good.<br /><br />Of course the ending of the film while good could have been better in my opinion and some scenes needed a boast. But I did like the performances here from our lead cast, now they did much better in the relationship scenes more so than the scientist scenes but oh well. Adrien Brody did a great job here as did Sarah Polley especially in anything that involved Dren. Of course it was great seeing my boy David Hewlett here even if he wasn't the star, Simona Maicanescu, and Brandon McGibbon were also good here. But it was Abigail Chu as child Dren and Delphine Chaneac as adult Dren that stole the show; they both did a great job.<br /><br />Director Vincenzo Natali along with fellow writers Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor did a great job here for the most part. The story is straight forward and not hard to follow at all but it is still compelling. Now to be honest it is Dren and the performances of the two that played her that really carried this film but all did a great job. There are flaws like with all things but I really liked this one for some reason. I think it is because I waited for the DVD release and had time to let hype die down. So I went into this with out any high expectations and I came out liking it.<br /><br />I do recommend this film but hit up a rental first because some people will most likely not like this. In fact some people may hate some of the things that happen in this flick, I loved it. When you watch you will know what parts I am talking about, I am sure some already do know. Over all this was much better than I thought it would be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>There's a point toward the end when the Spliced Monster has become a hot chick with a tail and bird legs and Adrian Brody puts on an old jazz record. For just a second, you think that this movie is going to go away from the hipster cliches and terrible acting and actually find a moment of whimsy in which to allow for a little space. Only Adrian Brody starts dancing and it's the most hammy bit of "look at me, I'm being cool" acting I've ever seen.<br /><br />In a movie where two terrible human beings are taking care of an alien monsters as the worst parents in the world, there is no one to like. One keeps trying to kill her and the other one steals her cat. Adrian Brody can't act. Sarah Polley keeps alternating between telling spliced daughter that she loves her and stealing her cat. Adrian Brody can't act.<br /><br />The story line is a dull plodding little number full of long tedious little set pieces (when the title character is actually spelling out Tedious on a Scrabble Board, it's almost as if someone on set is crying out for help) leading to perverse sexual politics make no sense whatsoever save for being very rapey.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>I bought this on my B-day on a whim just wanting to see some decent sci-fi, I got my copy from Target. I don't care for the cast, but do like the basic story and just enjoy the strange aspects of the plot. So it's just decent, nothing great. Scientists in a relationship, working together so synthesize a hybrid life form for scientific exploitations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Splice(released June/10)stars Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody and was a Canadian/French co-production,filmed in and around Toronto.This Sci-Fi thriller is not quite as thrilling as I thought it would be.I don't know if its the length,the been there-done that moments in the plot,the lack of chemistry between the two stars or something else but it certainly lacks a serious punch.<br />The plot involves the two stars as geneticists working for a pharmaceutical company in R&D.The two create two live "lumps" and name them Fred and Ginger.However they want to push the envelope even farther,so Sarah injects some of her own DNA into a genetic soup and voila,Dren is born.At first it's a kind of cute though uncoordinated cat-like creature on long spindly legs but it soon is growing at an exponential rate.In order to keep their secret a secret,they take Dren to Sarah's parents abandoned farm where they keep her under wraps as she matures.With her physical growth comes mental growth and she continues to amaze and astonish Adrien and Sarah constantly.By accident they discover she is a water breather and after a fit of temper Dren takes to the roof and sprouts wings!<br />As time wears on Dren is developing feelings for Adrien who ends up sleeping with her.Sarah finds them together and storms out.At a conference of big wigs and backers,their company puts on a display of Fred and Ginger.When they put them together they inexplicably end up killing each other in a blood bath that spills into the audience.It turns out one of them transformed from a female into a male.The company is ruined unless the two can come up with a special cloning sequence they have been working on but so far to no avail.Sarah returns with a piece of Dren and successfully creates the sequence.In the meantime Dren is found in a comatose state back on the farm and she apparently ends up dying on them.Just after they bury her Adriens movie brother and their boss show up demanding to see the creature.As Sarah tosses the boss the shovel to go dig her up himself,something flies down a swoops him away.In a few moments it's  Adriens brother turn.Both go running into the woods to search for them but Adrien loses his light in a pond.As he is retrieving it he is pulled in,and after a few tense moments resurfaces,and is helped onto the ground unable to move.Suddenly the creature that was Dren is now rising from the pond,has wings and is now a male;and he's after some female companionship.The creature chases Sarah down and has intercourse with her.Adrien shows up to impale the creature with a strong branch but Dren pulls it out more being more than a little mad at Adrien.As the creature turns its attentions on him it gives Sarah a chance to gather her wits and hit Dren from behind.Just before she gives it the final blow,Dren kills Adrien with a swift flick of its tale.<br />The film ends as we see the head of the pharmaceutical company offering Sarah a lucrative contract for her continuing aid in R&D.We also see she's pregnant.Was it Adrien or Dren?<br />As I said at the start,I don't know what it is about this movie that just doesn't excite me as it should.The S/FX and make up are top notch involving DREN,the acting is solid but it lies somewhere between the lack of good scary moments and their timing when they do occur,to the lack of on screen chemistry between Polley and Brody.Plus the script is little on the ho-hum side too.Just nothing to sink your teeth into.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in its' original a/r of 1:78:1.Extras include the trailer,a teaser,a Fangoria mag interview with the director and a behind the scenes look at the set.<br />All in all this average to just above average flick plays well as far as the creature is concerned and the S/FXs and make up involved therein.But the movie overall doesn't have the scary impact it should and as a result when the "tense" moments come they play out more with a whimper than a bang.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Splice' is an average sci-fi horror film about what happens when two scientists start playing around with genes and nature and the dire consequences.<br /><br />Clive and Elsa are two scientists who splice DNA from different animals to make proteins for the medical industry.  When they secretly splice human DNA into the mix the result is a weird hybrid, who grows at an alarming rate and has unique characteristics that are at first intriguing and which quickly become more alarming.<br /><br />The special effects in this film are reasonable and the plot, whilst predictable and clich&eacute;d is entertaining enough.  The acting leaves a lot to be desired and I have seen Brody act a lot better than what he offers us in this film.<br /><br />This film feels a bit flat to be honest.  It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it doesn't offer anything new and it plods along without any real zest or flair.  It feels like it is a `sci-fi by-numbers' film and the director doesn't try to do anything new or original with the concept.<br /><br />Never-the-less it is worth a viewing if you can catch it on TV for free or as part of a rental package.  It isn't quite as bad as some people have said, but it's not far off!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie was pretty good. it is not your normal slash them up creature film. i though it had more of a moral to the story than anything else. this movie should actually be under the gener of science fiction than horror. The scary thing about this movie is that could actually happen. I was very impressed by the actors and i'm glad that dren was not a full cgi creature it made it feal more real. well all in all this movie was good.</p></br></body></html>

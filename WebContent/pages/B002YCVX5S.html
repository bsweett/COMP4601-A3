This was the second time,as I had seen it in the movies last September.  It is an enjoyable and exciting film, good but not great.  The problem is too many scenes go on way too long.  The opening scene in the film is suspenseful, but goes on way too long: about 20 minutes.  I felt it was too long in the movies and last night I almost immediately forwarded to scene 2.  There is one other excruciatingly long scene involving a couple of the "basterds" and a British spy meeting a German film actress and allied spy (Diane Kruger) in a bar.  This scene also goes on way too long but, at least, ends excitingly.<br />Speaking of the "basterds," they really do not play the major part in the film and are on screen rather sparingly.  For a film advertised as an action film, until the conclusion there really isn't that much action.  As for the actors, Brad Pitt has a few good scenes and his Southern accent is amusing.  However much of the film is spent with his chin out and a rather stupid expression on his face, he looks almost mentally retarded at times.  The major find in this film is Melanie Laurent, the french actress who plays the Jewish owner of the movie theater which Goebbels chooses for the premiere of his Nazi propaganda film.  This actress is not only beautiful, but gives an absolutely wonderful performance.  You cannot take your eyes off her when she is on screen, she reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn in that regard.  Diane Kruger is also excellent as the German film star, secretly spying for the allies.  And finally Christoph. Waltz, as the SS Colonel Landa, nicknamed the "Jew Hunter," gives a fantastic performance also.<br />There are numerous extras on the blu-ray including extended scenes (although many of the scenes really did not need any extensions.)  My favorite extra is a 2 part interview with Rod Taylor who has a short part as Winston Churchill.  He was one of my favorite actors growing up in the '50s and '60s, starring in 2 of my all-time favorite films: Hitchcock's "The Birds" and George Pal's production of H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine."  I especially enjoyed hearing Taylor relate how, years ago, Quentin Tarantino wrote him for an autographed picture which Tarantino still has.  I can relate to this.  I have written to Taylor on several occassions and have several very nice signed lobby cards from him, including one from "The Birds" which I have framed, hanging on my wall.  The fact that Tarantino sought Taylor out to play this small role heightens my respect for him.<br />In conclusion, this is kind of a fun fantasy to watch, if you are aware that there is more talk than action and some very long, long scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>I don't think I've seen a Tarantino film I liked more than Inglorious Basterds. It has a little bit of everything a guy's movie should have...wanton and gratuitous violence, language that would make sailors blush and of course beautiful (and dangerous) women. I really liked seeing Brad Pitt take on a different role than what I've come to expect from him and just run with it. Michael Fassbender is at his swaggering stiff-upper-lip best as well. If the kids are already put to sleep, check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I found the Kill Bills to be unwatchable and the director to be generally too mannered so that I don't bother with his movies.  However, this is a longed-for Us vs. Nahtzees movie.  Killing the Jews is like Killing Gandalf times 6 million and more.  Why would you think that anyone shares your anti-semitism?  Why would you believe that when you KNOW that you hate Jews not because they did anything but because you are all wrong inside of you?  This movie expresses so much about the war against evil.  The American self-confident disdain in a seemingly unedumacated manner embodied by Brad Pitt's character, the young bright elf eyes of Eli Roth and the sadness and young eagerness when he spies his chance to get Adolf,  the appalling rudeness and their delight in boot-stomping their way into private French residences and making French fathers fear for their daughters, the endurance and the high quality of the French Jewish heroine who SUFFERS and sees so clearly, the clarity that most of us reach about the Nahtzees and their fantasies of popularity and grandeur and getting the red carpet treatment embodied in the Frederick Zoller character who has a pocketful of modest mannerisms ready for anticipated accolades.  The Oscar win went to the most well-constructed and hard working performance in the film.  The Oscar win came about due to the German actor's effort and the complex role given him.  His performance is worth remembering. It doesn't sit well with anyone of us when we hear that so many Nahtzees were given American citizenship by the CIA for the information they could give the Allies.  Is the Lando character supposed to be Rudolph Hess?  If so, I hope the English have him and not the Americans.  We've got more than we want here already.  I bet Rudy told the Allies EVERYTHING and had fun doing it.  Hilariously, Quentin Tarantino made real life Skrull Diane Kruger beg to audition for the role because he claimed he didn't believe that she was really German.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>Eventually, this next Holocaust-related vaudeville is the latest attempt to professionally contribute a tragic topic visualisation by an "eatable" way attracting contemporary viewers with murdering, gore, blood mixed with sex, sadism and some historic data.<br /><br />Performing is starling, characters are clever, educated, and professional and worth each other enemies, Brad Pitt is sexy even in moms and baggy camouflage, Hitler looks the most realistic than in any other movie a reviewer had seen, a clone from "Adolf & Eva" surely  - and something anyway in the air not allowing to top-mark this work. Probably, it is an unnecessary exaggeration of producer's own delusions of both history recorded and glorifying the unspeakable to an extent of heroic.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>It finally hit me while watching Basterds that QT is a complete and utter sadist. The best performance here is the film's main sadist, whom the director clearly identifies with to a large degree. QT delights as usual in showing extreme violence in great detail. Someone please tell me how Aldo Raine calmly eating his lunch while watching a man be beat to death with a baseball bat is in any way not as reprehensible as any Nazi killing. Please. The Nazis had their own self-justifications, too. Torture is torture, whoever's doing it.<br /><br />It's that kind of juvenile delight in others' pain that makes Tarantino happy. It's in almost every film he's done, with the exception of Jackie Brown, which along with Pulp is the only thing he's done that moved me intelligently. You can almost hear him salivating behind the camera as the sick stuff pulled from his warped sense of justice plays out on the screen. How is that masterful? Coppola is masterful; watch how the Godfather's violence plays out, then watch a QT film. That's the difference between art and psychosis, to my eyes.<br /><br />I'm sure the fanboys will dump all over this opinion, but then again, look at the folks who worship QT...and worship is the right word. The ones I see here in Austin, and there are plenty, seem to be just like their hero: the kind of guy who got beaten up in high school and gets revenge in delighting in others' suffering, real or cinematic. I saw the first few QT film fests he did here, and while his pre-screening talks were often interesting (and painfully hyper-speed; sniff sniff, hello Peru!), there was also a sense of a guy who thinks film is reality and that the rest of life is just prelude to the lights going down. Perhaps that's why he can't see how sadistic his own vision is.<br /><br />He found his perfect subject here, for who can complain about revenge on the Nazis? Yet it all feels to me no less disgusting than what the Germans were up to. Listen to Raine's first speech; that's promotion of genocide, pretty much. And the graphic displays of scalps being cut off? Come on, what exactly is the point of that except delight in other's suffering? Hate begets hate, and any truly mature filmmaker seeks redemption not in revenge, but in understanding and transcendence. Or, maybe I'm just wrong and it's all about an eye for an eye. Make them all suffer! In hi-def, with lots of blood and screaming! Yay team!!<br /><br />Yes, Quentin is a technically fine director, and the opening scene is good (though hardly the revelation many claim; there are plenty of war films with many more gripping scenes than that). But the whole Raines subplot is entirely unnecessary here, and seems to exist only to let QT and his fanboys delight in onscreen torture, supposedly justified by the other side's own atrocities. The main story is much more interesting, and if it alone had been the whole movie, it would be a much finer work. But Tarantino needs to torture people. He lives for it. And that's sadism, pure and simple.<br /><br />I did very much enjoy the performances of Waltz and Laurent, and the main story is decent enough (if totally unbelievable; Hitler brings all his top guys to a little theatre in France with almost no security outside? Sure.). But add that pointless subplot and the film becomes over two and half hours long, and that felt about 45 minutes too long to me. Take out the gleeful violence and suddenly it makes sense. But I guess that's not what Quentin's audience signs up for; they love the blood and gore and he's more than happy to deliver.<br /><br />He's got the skills, sure, but for my money he needs to dump the incessant violence and focus on character and plot development instead of seeing how many graphic killings he can insert into every film.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>A group of Jewish American soldiers in WWII has had enough, and is going deep behind enemy lines.  Lt. Aldo Raine wants 100 Nazi scalps from each man in his unit, and he means that literally.  But the Basterds will have to go against Colonel Hanz Landa of the SS, an insidious wrung-climber who will stop at nothing to get whatever it is that he wants. Who will win?<br /><br />The winner, of course, is Tarantino, who has reinvented history with INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, a truly glorious film that defies categorization.  It doesn't even, at times, feel like a Tarantino film; that opening scene between Landa and the dairy farmer is so full of tension, you'll have soaked your clothes in sweat within the first ten minutes.  And the whole film is somewhat sluggishly paced, which actually serves Tarantino's plot well; while we never really get close to the Basterds (for good reason; these aren't your lovable flag-waving soldiers, these guys are almost as sadistic as the Nazis they're pursuing), we spend plenty of time with Landa, as well as Shossana Dryfus, who escapes Landa as a child, only to re-encounter him years later.  The point is, we get close to some of these people--we learn to chear for Shossana, and learn to loathe Landa with every inch of our being.<br /><br />You'll watch this movie for one of three reasons, I'm sure:<br />1) You're a Tarantino fan, and so will watch whatever he puts out, even if it's a documentary of his bowel movements.  I won't judge; I probably would too.<br />2) You like war movies.  Well, you may not get what you want here--this is revisionist cinema at its finest, and this ain't your granddaddy's war movie.  It's loud and gory and with so much moral ambiguity, you'll actually consider rooting for the bad guys.<br />3) You've heard about the fine performances.  Eli Roth is slightly miscast, though he has so much fun in his role, it's forgivable.  Michael Fassbender is so smooth and cool, you'll wish there was more of him.  Michael Meyers is Michael Meyers (really, Quentin?  Not your worst casting choice ever, but it's up there.)  Brad Pitt is hamming it up hardcore and loving every single second of it. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger as the femme fatales are a blast to watch.  But the real gold here, as I'm sure you've heard, is Cristoph Waltz, who brings the movie villain to a whole new role.  Every single actor who plays a Nazi from here on out will study Waltz's flawless performance, and wish they were half as good.  Hanz Landa is the definition of "smooth criminal"--a dastardly, multi-lingual genius who has a knack for sniffing out Jews (hence his name, The Jew Hunter), though we're never really sure what his motives are.  Waltz--fluent in German, French, and English, and with a decent grasp of Italian pronunciation--plays his role to the hilt through four languages, and steals every single scene he's in.  If you don't want to watch this movie for any other reason, watch it for him.<br /><br />INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is easily one of Tarantino's best; for me, it ranks only behind RESEVOIR DOGS (though if somebody wants to argue for PULP FICTION, I'll understand).  This film is relentless, and is sure to piss off some people with its rather unflattering portrayal of the American WWII soldier, not to mention the guts Tarantino displays near the end.  Throughout, it is one violent, bloody ride, with laughter and terror and everything between.  It is a beautiful film, it is a brutal film, and it should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>That one cracked me up, but unfortunately not to many yucks in this flick....the cringe factor is very high.<br /><br />Highly unusual Tarantino film. I have to admit that the first time I saw it I hated it. The second viewing was slightly more objective and if not for my frustration with all the Evelyn Wood designed subtitles I probably would have given this thing 4 stars. As it is however, this movie drags, is overlong by at least 30 minutes, and contains some elements like the Bear Jew, the Bat, and some other unmentionables that I could live without. On the plus side, I thought Brad Pitt's performance was hilarious. Somewhat reminiscent of his Early Grace character from Kalifornia, completely over the top and bigger than life. And Christopher Waltz deserves all the praise, he was phenomenal.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie has been talked about to hell and back and I really dont have much to add except to say its not for everybody. Typical of Tarantino's efforts of late, you either love it or hate it. I'm mostly indifferent except to say this was a wasted opportunity, it could have been much better.<br /><br />BTW, a piece of trivia for ya'll. Pitt's character Aldo Raine hailed from Maynardville, TN. That's about 20 miles north of Knoxville. Fans are all aware of Tarantino's Knoxville roots, and of his tendency to insert some reference to Knoxville or whatever but Maynardville is noteworthy for being the home of a local cult favorite, a visionary telephone terrorist by the name of John Bean, the original whoopass man. John passed away over 20 years ago, but some of his classic work like Eddie's Auto and Thom McCann's is still some of the funniest comedy ever recorded. Amazon has his entire body of work titled under the "Real Leroy Mercer". The man was seriously deranged, sort of like Quentin Tarantino who I am quite sure is a huge John Bean fan. 3 fastballs</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino likes to create art house/big budget films in traditionally low-budget genres or hybrids. That the films are simultaneously art house and big budget is a testament to his keen sense for what audiences enjoy that they probably didn't realize themselves. A copycat certainly; overrated perhaps; but I have to give the guy credit for his surprising commercial success with films that are essentially about other films. He's not always successful, but sometimes Tarantino hits the right note with his self-referential, genre-bending, absurdist bloodbaths. "Inglourious Basterds" is one of those times. The film takes its name and genre from the Italian 1978 "macaroni war" film whose title is spelled correctly. Who would have thought it possible to make a macaroni war flick (or a parody of one) appeal to modern audiences and make it funny to boot?<br /><br />The setting is German-occupied France in the early 1940s. American Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his team of 8 Jewish soldiers were air-dropped into France with the purpose of scaring the bejesus out of the German army by killing and scalping every Nazi in their sight. Their tactics are sufficiently extravagant to inspire fear in their enemies and furor in the F&uuml;hrer back in Berlin. Meanwhile, Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a Jewish dairy farmer until her family was murdered by SS "Jew Hunter" Col. Hans Landa, is hiding in plain sight in Paris, where she operates a cinema under an assumed name. A smitten German soldier, Pvt. Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), campaigns for her theater to host a grand German movie premiere, while the British and the Basterds see the extravaganza as an opportunity to kill a lot of Nazis with one big bang.<br /><br />"Inglourious Basterds" doesn't take trouble not to offend anyone. The Basterds are not just stereotypical brazen Americans, but sociopaths. The Brits are refined and organized, but effete and ineffectual. The Germans are overbearing, cruel, and quite mad. Shosanna and her lover Marcel (Jacky Ido) are the only sympathetic characters, and their plans are not exactly virtuous. But they're all immensely entertaining. In Tarantino fashion, many scenes do nothing to further the plot. They're filled with the director's signature pop culture banter -World War II style, in three languages. Half the jokes are in subtitles. It works. Those scenes are in turns suspenseful and hilarious. Austrian actor Christoph Waltz deserves the abundant praise he has received for making Col. Landa a pleasant and ruthless bureaucrat. His vicious caricature somehow has great charisma. The plot does nothing more than build to the explosive showdown, but the dialogue is where the real action is.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc): Bonus features are 2 extended scenes, 1 alternate scene, 4 trailers (teaser, domestic trailer, international trailer, Japanese trailer), and "Nation's Pride Full Feature" (6 min), which is the entirety of the Zoller biographical film we see in the film, entitled "Stolz der Nation" in German. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish, though I'm not certain if all of the dialogue is dubbed. "Inglourious Basterds" characters speak three languages: English, French, and German, so the film is intended to be viewed with subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Polarizing filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's unadulterated love of cinema is really the most pervasive factor in his fantastical 2009 World War II adventure. Running an epic-length 153 minutes, it may appear on the surface like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVRS">The Longest Day</a>, but the director/writer takes inspiration from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U6YI92">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>), Robert Aldrich's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNM4">The Dirty Dozen</a>, Hollywood wartime propaganda B-movies, and his own adrenaline-infused and blackly comic films (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068DBC">Pulp Fiction</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068ULLY">Kill Bill</a>) to tell an audacious "what-if...?" story about a group of guerrilla U.S. soldiers in Nazi-occupied France. The tightly wound plot revolves around three key figures: Colonel Hans Landa, an elegant, seemingly bloodless Nazi officer known as "The Jew Hunter"; Lt. Aldo Raine, a Tennessee-born resistance fighter who has organized a special squad of Jewish-American soldiers whose goal is scalping and killing Nazis; and Emmanuelle Mimieux (n&eacute;e Shosanna Dreyfus), a pensive young Jewish woman who runs a movie theater in Paris.<br /><br />As presented by Tarantino over the course of five discrete chapters, the three disparate figures converge upon Mimieux's theater for the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film called "A Nation's Pride". There in attendance is to be not only Third Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels but also the Fuehrer himself. Needless to say, the filmmaker has carefully set up all his chess pieces for a flamboyant finale that represents a manifestation of some kind of crude moral justice that revisionist history allows only grand storytellers like Tarantino. Riddled with quirky incongruities, some of which border a bit too closely to self-parody, his signature style is evident through a series of set pieces, most heavy on insinuating dialogue, that suddenly explode like the tavern m?l&eacute;e in La Louisiane.<br /><br />In a turnabout from his Oscar-baiting performance last year as the passive Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt brings cocksure arrogance to Raine in an enjoyably hammy turn. M&eacute;lanie Laurent perfectly captures Shosanna's simmering resentment until her cathartic release during the explosive conclusion, while Diane Kruger cuts a somewhat more predictable figure as a Dietrich-like femme fatale actress in cahoots with Raine's battalion. Tarantino fills smaller roles with oddball choices like Mike Myers as a pip-pip British general, Rod Taylor (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783240236">The Birds</a>) as Churchill, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel</a> director Eli Roth as a baseball bat-wielding Nazi killer. Regardless, the best work comes from Christoph Waltz's nuanced turn as the sadistic Landa. It's a masterfully subtle performance amid a movie that is anything but subtle.<br /><br />Waltz's best scene comes right at the beginning with his unbearably tense conversation with a stoic French farmer suspected of hiding a family of Jews. There is also glorious camerawork from veteran cinematographer Robert Richardson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDL93">JFK</a>). The extras seem a bit too stretched out for the 2009 two-disc set, especially with no Tarantino commentary being offered in this package. Instead, on the first disc, we get two extended scenes and one alternate, the movie-within-the-movie "A Nation's Pride", and a few trailers. The second disc offers a half-hour round table discussion among Tarantino, Pitt, and film critic Elvis Mitchell; a faux-making-of featurette for "A Nation's Pride"; a discussion of the original Italian movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00140PKEQ">Inglorious Bastards</a> (upon which this movie bears little similarity); and a few other more obscure extras. Love it or hate it, the film reflects the filmmaker's uniquely audacious style in his most serious effort to date.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>I'll admit I popped Inglourious Basterds in the player expecting a completely different movie, a mind-numbing violent and bloody movie.  That didn't happen so I kept asking myself "what is going on here?"  I was too curious to stop watching because the acting was incredible, purposefully exaggerated, and at times absolutely hysterical (Brad Pitt).  About 2/3's of the way through the movie it hit me what was going on; the movie is about headgames!<br /><br />I immediately started the movie over and watched it from the headgame perspective.  Inglourious Basterds is BRILLIANT in every scene from start to finish demonstrating both how to play headgames on others and how one's own headgames messes with your own behavior.  The script, pace, timing, and total commitment of every character to the headgames they are going to inflict or endure is masterful. The movie plays like a mental chess game where the characters disarm, position, or manipulate their opponents, establish their offense, then attack when the time is right.  Every chapter demonstrates something new to add to the story.<br /><br />If you have to deal with headgames in your life at any level, watch Inglourious Basterds with your brain turned into the headgame frequency.  You will be entertained and educated.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This is in no way a true story, though it is based on true situations. The Germans in general and the German SS in particular killed millions of Jews, one by one, one after another, or massively in their camps. And when the Jewish local band at Auschwitz was playing some music for some inner celebration of some kind, thousands were arriving on the trains and were disembarked on the platform, sorted out for shower and then cremated. The crematorium never stopped burning.<br /><br />That in France, in the Resistance or dropped into the country with parachutes generally, there were units, some made up of Jews from all nations around the world, is no surprise, is no invention. That these units were vengeful and tried to make some Germans they could catch, SS or not, pay for their evil actions in suffering and torturing and all kinds of other immoral, unwarlike and despicable actions is no invention. There were at least some and maybe many.<br /><br />To make a film on that very subject is not uninteresting. But does it have any interest for the knowledge of history, for the education of the younger generations, for the moral and ethical good of everyone? Certainly not. It is a film about war seen as an act of vengeance, and the film itself is an act of vengeance against people who are not there to say a word about it. Vengeance is not a good attitude. Try to imagine what the Vietnamese should say, show and even do against the French or the Americans because of the Indochina or Vietnam wars if they were vengeful.<br /><br />But then why did Tarantino, a good film maker, and Brad Pitt, a good actor, decided to do that film? To follow Tom Cruise in that territory, but Tom Cruise was at least dealing with a real episode of the war. Maybe to deal with some "respectable" horror, horror that can be said ethical or ethically motivated? As for that the film is dealing with so many clich&eacute;s about the sexual and brutal phantasms of standard human beings that it becomes a parade of events about which we seem to think, one after the other, how gory is it going to be? Gory, exciting, gross, disgusting? We seem to be appealed by the entry "horror" of a thesaurus. I find this film regrettable and very badly inspired.<br /><br />Apart from that, the film is well done, contains a good dose of suspense or thrilling expectations, and the editing as much as the shooting (what a word in this context) are realistic enough to make us believe we are in Paris or we are in history. But it takes more than good technique to make a good film. Since the dominant point of view in the film is Jewish, I consider that this vengeful attitude in Jews is absolutely unacceptable, and I can tell you those I know and who have done something during the war, did not do that kind of horror which was more on the side of the SS for one and some resistance groups that were not exactly controlled by presentable networks: there were some freelance groups that only took advantage of the situation to loot, raid and just satisfy their death instinct on anyone who could be in their way, far from it only the Germans.<br /><br />Now we are 65 years after the end of this butchery we could start in the film industry to get to a more historical perspective and not to some crazy idea that Hitler could have been burnt up with all its accomplices in a Paris local cinema by a Jewish female survivor, a black man, and the non-coordinated help of two American Jews. Or maybe it is just plain Jewish black humor. But the subject is badly chosen and that kind of humor has to be self-deprecating. It is not. Those Jewish barbarians want to appear as war heroes not as pathetic puppets in the hands of some illuminated blood-crazed scalp-obsessed guru.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>I found this movie quite surprising for a number of reasons.  Initially I was kinda pissed at Tarantino, assuming he had jumped on the remake bandwagon by redoing Enzo Castellari's Italian war flick, Inglorious Bastards.  Thankfully, Tarantino didn't go that route.  Aside from the catchy(slightly altered) title, and the film being set during WWII, Tarantino's film has practically nothing to do with Castellari's film.  So that was a(pleasant)surprise.  Lots of folks hated this film.  Though I think many people know what to expect from Tarantino at this point, many folks still felt let down by this one.  I can only imagine that the modern filmgoer, who requires stimulation and action every two minutes or they get bored, was put off by the fact that this had little onscreen warefare action.  I can only imagine people were expecting two and a half hours of relentless Saving Private Ryan-type action.  Nope, doesn't happen.  Instead they got....uh oh....a plot that actually took it's time to unfold!  Imagine that nonsense!  Strike one.  Also, Brad Pitt is the star power, but people found that he doesn't have much screen time, and instead, much of the screen time is devoted to relatively unknown actors.  Personally, I thought this was great coz I don't care for Brad Pitt and I'm not sure how I would have responded to 150 minutes of his mug in every frame.  Strike two for all those Pitt fans who went to see it.  Then you got the dialogue.  Modern theatergoers can't stand dialogue driven films, and not only is this film dialogue driven to hell, but most of it is in subtitles!!  The one thing modern audiences hate more than Black and White film is subtitles!  Strike three.<br />Tarantino really pulled one over, didn't he?  He(God forbid)gave the film a slow, Sergio Leone type pacing(Tarantino always wears his influences on his sleeve, and Leone seems to be a big influence on this movie), he minimized the big Hollywood star's screen time and essentially made him a supporting character, and he had the Germans and the French speaking their native language.  Wow.<br />In a nutshell the plot is about a Jewish theater owner's plan to kill Hitler and many of the high ranking officials of the Nazi party when they all decide to attend a film premiere at her theater in 1944 Nazi occupied France.  Meanwhile, a small ragtag group of Jewish soldiers("The Basterds") led by Brad Pitt and his brutal right hand man played by Eli Roth(just when I was beginning to think we'd finally started seeing the end of this guy), are on a rage fueled mission to kill and scalp as many Nazis as possible.  The "Basterds" also find out about the film premiere and hatch their own plan to destroy Hitler and his Reich.  There are a few minor subpots and characters, but everything serves as a buildup to the night of the film premiere.<br />Basically what Tarantino did here(as he pretty much does with all of his movies)is made an exploitation film masquerading as a Hollywood film.  From the title cards introducing/pointing out characters, the minimal(and pointless) use of a narrator(Samuel L. Jackson), anachronistic music that includes 70s style funk, over-the-top performances and characters(Pitt especally), graphic gratuitous violence, and a total disregard for factual history make this a big exploitation film in a very thin disguise.  I mean, come on, all bets are off when Mike Myers appears in a small role, I don't care if he is playing it serious.  I realize that exploiting the atrocities of WWII for the sake of movie entertainment seems to be in very bad taste, but hey, it worked for Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS, and what household in America doesn't own and cherish a copy of that movie?<br />Some flak aimed at this movie comes from the fact that Jews are all portrayed as bloodthirsty savages bent on revenge.  So what?  If the same characters had been Irish, nobody would be saying anything.  Violent revenge films have existed for many years and span countless film genres.  There's really no point in reading into it all that deeply.  After all, this is a movie where Hitler walks out of the theater so he can ask the SS soldier standing guard for a piece of gum.<br />So, yeah, I thought this was a surprisingly good movie.  Sure it has it's faults.  It does suffer from a tad much of Tarantino's diarrhea of the mouth(though unlike the excruciating yammering of Death Proof, most of the dialogue here at least holds interest), and some scenes don't need to go on quite as long as they do, but for the mostpart I feel Tarantino succeeded in making his best film in quite a few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I am a huge QT fan so I went expecting a lot from this film. The movie is simply an experience and Tarantino immerses you into this world.  I honestly am very surprised that there are so many comments stating this is a bad movie and Tarantino trash. I understand not everyone loves QT but how can you not appreciate the writing and acting in this film. The film, as most of us know by now, is a WWII revenge saga that follows a small unit of Jewish-American soldiers as they wreak violent (and darkly funny) havoc on the German Army. The screenplay is astounding, containing some of the best film dialogue in recent years. The opening scene where SS Col. Hans Landa interrogates a French dairy farmer is among Tarantino's finest work. This single scene is over 20 minutes long and yet the viewer's attention is captured throughout. Tarantino does this again later in the film, with a nearly 30 minute scene in a pub that leads to a sudden, bloody conclusion.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is top notch. Brad Pitt offers one of his funniest performances in years as a charismatic southern army lieutenant with a knack for carving swastikas into the foreheads of Nazi soldiers. Christoph Walz will surely receive an Oscar nomination for his scene-stealing performance as the ruthless and cunning Col. Landa. Several impressive supporting performances appear as well.<br /><br />The score (as with Tarantino's other recent films) contains music taken from classic 70's soundtracks. I recognized bits from "White Lightning" and "Kelly's Heroes". There is some good spaghetti western music included as well.<br /><br />No doubt this was an entertaining film to watch and certainly a unique story and characters which has become a painfully absent commodity in Hollywood for quite a few years now. Only problem I had with the film is it seems to have lost some steam or creative energy in the story development in the second half. Maybe that's just QT bucking the traditional expected story arch, or perhaps he had more in mind for the film originally and had to settle for less and compress for time, I'm not sure. Either way he is exceptionally skilled at bringing what's in his head to life on film, almost to the point where it feels as though I'm not really watching actors in a movie, but being invited into a vivid daydream. Once again I just felt the last third of the film felt a little flat, could have used some more powerful twists than the ones he tossed in seemingly as an afterthought. QT does tend to come off as a bit of a rambler when he's speaking, to say the least, and I think he has all these grand ideas and just has a hard time fitting them all into a 2 hour flick. I'm in no way criticizing the guy's ability to make some of the best films ever, or even this movie which was awesome,<br /><br />Aside from that, "Inglourious Basterds" is entertaining  and one of my favorite Tarantino movies, I'm not too sure it's better then Jackie Brown, not quite as good as Pulp Fiction but a grower in the future to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>When this film came out earlier this year,<br />I figured Quentin Tarrantino, Brad Pitt...should be good!<br />To me it was, with the exception of some of the<br />scenes which could've been cut shorter and their points<br />would have still been made.<br />But other than that, I loved it!<br />I went with two of my freinds and one of them acted<br />like the graphic violence was just too much for her<br />delicate sensibilities, and I thought to myself<br />"DUH!-It's Quentin Tarrantino!, i.e. Reservoir Dogs?<br />--Pulp Fiction?--From Dusk Til' Dawn?---Kill Bill 1 & 2?--<br />I think everyone knows by now that graphic violence<br />is a given when you see his movies!"<br /><br />My other freind, a guy, found it just to be<br />"just okay", so see there you go...it's not a film<br />for everybody, but I found it to rank right up there<br />with Tarrantino's better work as a director.<br />As for Brad Pitt, I'm very bias when it comes to him...<br />I just think he and Johnny Depp can do no wrong in<br />anything that they play in!  (-:<br />But putting that aside and trying to be as analytical<br />as I can be for the sake of this review, I really found<br />his character to be quite believable as the ringleader of<br />a bunch of nazi-killing renegade soliders in WW2 who<br />suffer no fools and take no prisoners!<br />Eli Roth, the director of a lot of modern-day horror<br />fare was just that...HORRIFYING in his role as the<br />baseball bat-swinging, nazi-hating psycho "BEAR JEW"<br />who Brad's character refers to as THE REAPER!!<br />Brad effects his Missouri/Oklahoma southern accent<br />for this role, even though the character says he hails<br />from Tennessee!---But most people can't detect the difference.<br />Of course, being a QT film, there are plenty of sub plots<br />and plot twists all interwoven throughout, as well as<br />his trademark dark humor, culminating in an explosive ending.<br />So to those of you who haven't already seen it,<br />I'd say rent it first before buying it just to see if<br />it's your cup of tea. But I say it's a 4 star film for<br />sure, subtracting a point for the extra long scenes<br />that I mentioned earlier.<br />I have the 2-Disc version because there are some<br />great extras and deleted scenes that were cut,<br />but probably could've stayed to explain certain details,<br />like what's the backstory on Brad's character,<br />and how did he get those rope burn scars around his neck?

They had ridiculously over-the-top shoot-outs and naked Nazi women firing machine guns! Anyone? No?<br /><br />Well, Quentin Tarantino has taken the theme and topic of that silly film and turned it into something of his own. "Inglourious Basterds" doesn't quite have as much Nazi-killing as I expected, but it excels brilliantly with its plot, story, characters, dialogue, acting, cameramanship, and music selection. It is a bit strange perhaps, with some absurdity, but it is all earnest, original, and of decent quality. There are a couple of bloody brutal parts, but it's never over-done. There are some funny parts too, but it's also never over-done. Additionally, the movie has some interesting cultural/historical references and homages. Most of it even serves as a film about film and filmmaking, as the plot has a lot to do with a cinema. If you liked Tarantino's other work (especially "Pulp Fiction," which has a plot structure similar to "Inglourious Basterds") or it you want to see a war drama of a different nature, check this one out by all means.<br /><br />The disc has superb quality. The video looks incredibly sharp, clean, clear, and vivid; I saw no problems worth mentioning. Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 5.1). It includes numerous extras, and a digital copy. Comes with a slipcover.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was very good, but I didn't see it as great.  I thought the video was soft.  I had my TV set to "Vivid", and it still did not look great.  There wasn't any grain, but it just did not look sharp.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was great - lot's of surround sound.<br /><br />I thought the movie was pretty good.  It looked like it was 2.40:1, and lasted about 2 hours and thirty minutes.  There were a lot of sub-titles, and it did not give me enough time to read some of them.  I just don't like having to read the words; it distracts from the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>When I saw this movie I was hoping for a group of men who did a exciting mission  to inflitrate the Nazi's in France in other words a decent commando movie.  Instead this was more of a fantasy in which all the top Nazi's get killed off in a movie theater.  And we really didn't get to see a fast moving story like 'where eagles dare' or even 'the dirty dozen" among the many other movies.  Ok , the top Nazi's deserved to die in theater blown to bits. They were complete monsters but it's not even close to what really happened in history.  So this movie becomes a revenge fantasy movie , which if it had a suspenseful buildup would have been easier for me to digest.  However I am biased in that I have a degree in history and believe that at a least a basic framework should be followed when making some movies.  I love Quentin Tarantinos work including the underrated "jackie brown" but this one just was flat for me. And that has nothing to do with history. It wasn't like we saw them go behind the lines against the odds and carry out any mission. Instead we see a psychotic slaughter of German soldiers with nothing leading up to it much.<br />These were even really bad germans either.  This was a major A movie so on that scale I would have to give it a 3 star rating in my book.  The blu ray looks great though and it's the only way to go if you want to own this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I've read some other reviews and I can only be perpexed. Reviews can be opinions (objective) or opinionated (subjective). My objective opinion of "Inglourious Basterds" is that I was entertained a whole lot with a very clever and original script that could only be imagined by a smart and clever person. Action was good, when necessary, and suspense was ever present; occasional humor is always a plus. Acting was generally excellent, with Christoph Waltz (as Landa) the standout. He really makes you believe he loves being evil. Tarantino's dialogue is, as usual, rapid-fire, which made some of the sub-titled portions hard to follow, but the DVD format took care of that. Period detail was excellent as was the crisp, wide-screen cinematography. I was entertained and the ending is as satisfying as any I've seen. OK, Opinionated: I think Quentin Tarantino is extremely smart, not entirely crazy, and more in touch with his ideas and material than most give him credit. Credibility be damned, he knows how to spin a tale, always original, based on his experience as a film freak. At 2 ? hours, I was never bored. A fantasy about the Holocaust (that's not "Springtime for Hitler")? Ingenious! Tarantino knows how to craft a film this crazy into an entertaining whole. He has my admiration, since "Pulp Fiction", "Kill Bill", "Grindhouse", and even "Jackie Brown". Originality isn't given enough credit in Hollywood, and, yes, Tarantino has developed a style, but that's not a bad thing. I loved his tribute to "Duel in the Sun" at the end...</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Tarrentino brings World War II Paris to life in a new fashion.  A young Jewish girl escapes a search of a farmhouse by Nazis and makes her way to Paris.  Somehow she gets the identity of Emanuelle, an owner of one of the top Paris movie houses.  One day she is changing the titles on the marquee when she is approached by a young German soldier.  He becomes smitten with her but she tries being cold back to him to no avail.  It turns out he is somewhat of a big hero in Germany because he single handedly killed many enemy soldiers while being a sniper in a bell tower over a three day period.  Goebbels has made a propaganda movie starring the soldier as himself.  Later on the soldier comes up with the idea of showing the movie in Emanuelle's theater.<br /><br />The movie also focuses on a group of Jewish soldiers headed by a Tennessee leader (Brad Pitt) who infiltrate Nazi controlled areas and kill Nazis by either scalping them or leaving them to the Jew Bear with the bat (one of Pitt's men), also referred to as the Golem.  When Pitt's group ambushes Nazis he likes to always leave one man alive to tell the story of what happens.  The one left alive is not so lucky because Pitt will use a huge machete like knife to carve a swastika in the surviving German's forehead, to forever mark him as a Nazi.<br /><br />Tarrentino uses the "chapter" method used successfully in his Kill Bill films.  Along with that the ending of the film definately has the feel of a Tarrentino film.  Tarrentino does a remarkable job of shooting each chapter almost as a separate tale but each chapter converges by the end of the film.  Tarrentino does change history quite a bit but the movie is so good that the audience can forgive him and go along with how the movie turns out.<br /><br />A fresh and fun new telling of WW II.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>Inglourious Basterds was an ok film. It was amusing in it's own twisted way and the scalping can be a turn off for some. There are a lot of Nazi movies out there and this one is pretty good. The only thing i didn't like about the film was it was all subtitiles. I can handle subs usually but it was small and sometimes hard to read. Brad pitt did a good job and his charater was interesting. So all in all it's worth seeing. One of the better Nazi films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>What can I say about Inglourious Basterds? Unique, inventive, smart writing and excellent acting throughout are what first comes to mind when thinking about this film. Be warned, there is a lot of talking (the first scene is a 20 minute conversation), even for a Tarantino flick, but the dialogue is excellent and the characters are memorable. The only negative is that some scenes do drag just a little, but not enough to bore the life out of you. There are also some well crafted action scenes that are brutal, though they played a much more minor role than I expected.<br /><br />Brad Pitt turns in a fine performance and provides most of the comedic moments. Just don't expect him to be on the screen all the time. Unlike what you see in the trailers, he and his "Basterds" play supporting roles. There is no real leading role here, but one does take a commanding presence over all the rest. New to many people who will be watching this movie, Christoph Waltz delivers a performance to remember and will at minimum get nominated for an Oscar. He is clever, charming, slimy, unpredictable and evil. Expertly acted evil dudes seem to be cleaning up the supporting actor categories every year now. Javier Bardem won it for No Country for Old Men in 2007 and the late Heath Ledger did the same for the The Dark Knight in 2008. Why break tradition this year, especially given the complexity of Waltz's acting here. He already won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor award. The two main female actresses, Melanie Laurent (nomination worthy) and Diane Kruger, were both captivating and added the right elements this film needed. In fact, every person on screen seemed right for the role they were given. Well, horror director and buddy of Tarantino, Eli Roth, was a little off at times, but thankfully he has a smaller role and lets his baseball bat do most of the talking for him.<br /><br />Don't expect any historical accuracy, just get ready for a wild fantasy WWII movie that only Tarantino can pull off. His signature music and song selection is also some of his best. One thing is for sure, Quentin Tarantino is back on top in a BIG way.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Inglourious Basterds" is a fictional World War II film. To date it is Quentin Tarantino's highest-grossing movie.<br /><br />The film narrative boldly shifts away from the norm of factually based WWII pictures and presents a story where the war could potentially end by aiming to assassinate the entire German High Command.<br /><br />The story is multilayered and represents several points of views. The cast is loaded with personalities who are absorbing and Christoph Waltz's portrayal of SD Colonel Hans Landa is marvelous. On one hand Landa appears gentle and compassionate and on the other he is cold, ferocious and without a glimmer of mercy.<br /><br />Some viewers might be unsettled by a few violent scenes but any true admirer of Tarantino's work will feel right at home.<br /><br />Shot in France and Germany the cinematography is fantastic and it is a unique movie loaded with great scenes.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>At the end of the film, Pitt states "I think this may be my masterpiece" (or something to that nature) and in regards to Tarantino and his directorial efforts, I think that statement may apply here (however, not in regards to Brad Pitt who, sadly, is that acting `weak link' in this film).  Yes, Tarantino will have legions of fans bickering in rabid fashion over which gargantuan cult classic is the best (most will cheer for `Pulp Fiction', some `Kill Bill' and, until I saw this film, I was all about `Reservoir Dogs') but at the end of the day, when you stack everything back to back to back, his latest effort makes it very clear that he has learned and certainly grown as a director over the course of his career.<br /><br />This film is nearly perfect.<br /><br />I could go on all day dissecting this film and layer my review with countless praise-littered sentiments, but I'm going to try and refrain, just a little.<br /><br />I'm often told I'm a tad longwinded.<br /><br />The story itself is a fabricated fantasy piece set in the times of the Nazi regime where Tarantino has a group of violence-fascinated `Nazi Killers' waging war with a `Jew Hunter' and his reign of terror.  They aren't alone in their mission of hate-filled executions though.  At the films outset we are introduced to Landa, the `Jew Hunter', as he slaughters a Jewish family taking refuge in another man's home.  One of the family members, a young girl, escapes.  She in turn, years later, is presented with a rare opportunity that she cannot let slip through her fingers; revenge.<br /><br />The film never once appears lacking in rich Tarantino style, but it also carries with it a layer of sophistication that is not found in most of his work.  It is more polished; crisper if you will.  While some will balk at my statement and point out that `Pulp Fiction' itself is `sophisticated' (an assessment I will stand behind), I feel compelled to point out that while I love both films, this latest entry in the Tarantino roster surely shows much maturing since Tarantino's 90's heyday.  The narrative flow feels far less like a gimmick (yes, that is an accusation made against `Pulp Fiction', and one that bares some truth) and more like a fully fleshed out plot piece.  And while Tarantino has shown great visual flare in many of his films, especially his `Kill Bill' epic, he has never exuded so much class into his visual opuses as he does here.  Just look at the opening sequence.  It is breathtakingly staged, brilliantly acted and flawlessly captured.  The visual is fresh, rich and certainly eye-catching, but it isn't over-the-top.  The spectacle of it all doesn't take away from the seriousness of it all.  There is the tension, the dread, the emotional gut punch; not to mention the perfectly times flares of humor that take the scene to a whole new level.  In fact, that opening sequence should be preserved in a room for all struggling artists to venture when needing inspiration (that and the opening sequence to Fincher's `The Social Network').  It is a brilliant and inspired way to open a film, setting the tone effortlessly and inviting us (or should I say CONVINCING US) to walk right alongside Tarantino for the entire journey.<br /><br />Oh lord; I am getting longwinded, aren't I?<br /><br />I wanted to touch upon the acting, because as an ensemble it really does shine (and Christoph Waltz's Oscar win was VERY deserved).  Yes, Pitt is here and he is decent but he is also a tad overdone and certainly the films weakest performance.  In fact, Fassbender has a VERY short scene and yet he acts circles around anything Pitt does, adding an entire back-story to his devilishly charming grin.  That said; Waltz is just phenomenal, layering Landa with so much unintentional wit that you can't help but totally `get this guy'.  Sure, he's a creep, but you want him around.  Besides, Waltz really understood how to work with his fellow actors.  He plays off of them in each and every scene, and it actually boosts the performances of the entire cast.  In fact, some of the best moments come from other actors working off of Waltz's presence.  The other GIGANTIC standout here is Melanie Laurent.  She is mesmerizing here, and totally nails the inner tension that presents itself in her character.  She is not only stunning (seriously, gorgeous to look at) but she embodies the films moral core (yes, it has one) and exudes a sense of profound entitlement that I think is necessary to accepting the film as more than torture-porn.<br /><br />There is a method to Tarantino's madness, and Laurent holds the key.<br /><br />In the end I'm totally in this films corner.  It really should have swept at the Oscars (at least when you consider the films it was nominated against).  This film is far more entertaining, creative, stylistic, memorable and profound than James Cameron's opus of gigantic smurf people and their protests to `save the planet'.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I've never seen a Tarantino film before, only because none of his films interested me enough, so 2009's "Inglourious Basterds" is my first taste from his repertoire.<br /><br />The first time I tried to watch "Inglourious Basterds" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the long opening sequence was great but the film bogged down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation of WWII and the accompanying interminable dialogue (in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this. I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WWII film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of mostly subtitled dialogue.<br /><br />Well, I finally decided to give it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the "interminable dialogue (with subtitles)" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. I discovered that the drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.<br /><br />There ARE elements that bring to mind "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNM4">The Dirty Dozen</a>", including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick in until the final act, but "Basterds" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.<br /><br />All great films have great characters. With "Basterds" we have the stunning M&eacute;lanie Laurent as the cinema proprietor, who drips with vengeance toward the Nazis; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Landa, who mercilessly hunts down Jews, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but entertaining and memorable, leader of the Basterds; and super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy.<br /><br />Tarantino is renown as a great modern director, and so it is. "Basterds" shines with confidence, style and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the roll-your-eyes "blockbuster" syndrome that plagues modern cinema.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>... since I think everyone else here has already said all there is to say about the film.<br /><br />1-Disc DVD<br />2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen<br />English DD5.1 Surround<br />French and Spanish DD2.0 Stereo<br />English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles<br />Extended and Alternate Scenes<br />Nation's Pride - the film within the film can be seen in its entirety<br />Domestic and International Trailers<br /><br />2-Disc DVD - As above plus a bonus disc with the following content:<br />Roundtable discussion with Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt and film historian/critic Elvis Mitchell<br />The Making of Nation's Pride<br />The Original Inglorious Bastards - a salute to the original 1978 film<br />A conversation with veteran actor Rod Taylor<br />Rod Taylor on Victoria Bitters, the Australian beer<br />Quentin Tarantino's Camera Angel<br />Hi Sallys - Gag Reel<br />Film Poster Gallery Tour with Elvis Mitchell<br />Inglourious Basterds Poster Gallery<br />Digital Copy<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc - Includes the same extras as the 2-Disc SE DVD plus BD-Live functionality.

He'll just never top Pulp Fiction in my book. For great pacing and characters that would be cartoonish in the hands of lesser directors but believable and interesting in the hands of Tarantino, I highly recommend this film. It is worth owning and rewatching.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino had long spoken of his "war epic" that he had been working on and in late 2008, he unexpectedly announced that he had commenced filming and wanted to release it at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Upon its debut, it became the highest-grossing film of his career, opened to rave reviews, and the typical fanfare that greets just about any Tarantino film. Inglourious Basterds is not a war epic in the traditional sense...It's a war fantasy, in which Tarantino doesn't let the constraints of reality keep him from telling the story he wishes to tell. It's a large-scale epic, separated into five chapters, with a large cast, and a great villain.<br /><br />Chapter one is called "Once Upon a Time...In Nazi-Occupied France." Colonel Hans Landa of the SS (Christoph Waltz), nicknamed "the Jew Hunter," stops by the dairy farm of Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) to inquire about a missing family of Jews whom Landa believes LaPadite is hiding in his home. This is an explosive opening scene, beautifully shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, and absolutely bristling with suspense. The banter between Waltz and Menochet, coupled with the subtle musical score is a brilliant example of filmmaking, as well as a great way to establish the character Hans Landa. Meanwhile, we have the brief and understated performance by Menochet. In the scheme of things, with as many speaking roles as this movie has, Menochet has a relatively insignificant role in the film, and yet he has a rather remarkable impact. He lets us in to empathize with him as Landa slowly breaks him down.<br /><br />Chapter two introduces us to the "Basterds," a group whose mission is to spread fear throughout the German military by ruthlessly killing Nazi's. They're lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who leads the colorful characters through Germany, killing and scalping any Nazi's they come across. They've become so feared by the German military, even Hitler is aware of them.<br /><br />While there are 5 chapters, its only chapter three I'm going to elaborate any further on...This chapter, entitled "German Night in Paris," introduces us to Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), the surviving Jewish girl of chapter one, who operates a cinema in France under an assumed name. Shosanna is approached by Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a celebrated German war hero, who asks Shosanna to host a movie premiere of his movie "Nation's Pride," a movie premiere that will be attended by the top powers of the Third Reich, including Hitler himself.<br /><br />Of course, there are many more characters and many more actors. In setting up his film with chapters, Tarantino has made a film that, overall, has more of an episodic nature than a cohesive story. There is no main character in the film and many of the film's characters never meet each other and, really, it's only Hans Landa that really holds it all together. Don't be fooled by the theatrical trailers which portray the "Basterds" as the main characters...They actually have a relatively small amount of screen time. Other actors include the lovely Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress who's serving as a spy for the British. A surprising appearance by Mike Myers (yes, Austin Powers himself) has bothered some and I would have preferred a different choice myself, but he doesn't exactly bother me. It's just so noticeably Myers and he's so campy with his role it sort of breaks the spell woven by Inglourious Basterds momentarily.<br /><br />Many of this film's detractors cite it's casting much of the time, particularly Myers and director Eli Roth as the Basterds' Bear Jew. Roth is convincing physically as the Bear Jew and the maniacal look in his eyes (he's probably stoned) work well, but whenever he's required to speak (not very often) I didn't buy it. But he doesn't ruin the film by any stretch and, yes, he likely only got cast because he's friends with Tarantino...But, oh well. He does a decent job. Pitt is fantastic as Lt. Aldo Raine and it's his larger-than-life persona that makes this performance so effective and entertaining. If Pitt is campy in the role, it just fits well into the whole scheme of things. Many director's want you to suspend your disbelief and accept a film as a reality...Tarantino wants you to know you're watching a movie. Pitt will not win an Oscar for his performance, but I found his portrayal both compulsively watchable and hilarious. Finally, Waltz plays Hans Landa so menacingly he deserves all the critical accolades his performance has been met with. Waltz creates such a thoroughly evil, gleeful sociopathic character that is one of Tarantino's greatest creations. Waltz was a German television actor that Tarantino picked for the role and I haven't seen a more impressive supporting performance this year.<br /><br />The dialogue is typical Tarantino ("We ain't in the prisoner-takin' business, we in the killin' Nazi business and, cousin, business is a boomin'"), although it's worth noting that much of the dialogue is subtitled. This surprised me when I first saw the film and I can imagine some will be angered by this. A large majority of the film is in a language other than English, but you can still feel the effect of Tarantino's dialogue.<br /><br />Also very impressive and a huge component of the film is its musical score; one that only Tarantino would use for a World War II epic. Tarantino has always had a gift for picking music for his film and this film is no exception. Despite many of Tarantino's flourishes, this film has the least Tarantino-like feel to it, although I can't quite put my finger on why.<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone and even fans of war movies and/or Tarantino will be disappointed by it. It's not a perfect film and, while I think it's a great film, I wonder if it would've been greater had Tarantino not rushed into making it.  It's got a brilliant opening scene and a terrific ending (whether it makes complete sense or not) and it further cements Tarantino's status as one of Hollywood's greatest film directors. Inglourious Basterds is one of the best, most entertaining films of 2009; a celebration of cinema and what makes movies so great.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Inglourious Basterds," directed by Quentin Tarantino, is about World War II, the SS, a band of relentless Nazi killers, movie star spies, and a German war hero, among other things.  It is a rich film in many ways:  plot, star power, performances, photography, film references, and dark humor.  Defying traditional compartmentalization, it offers an intriguing, textured story, action, and nice helpings of satire.  In short, "Inglourious Basterds" is a feast for movie lovers.<br /><br />Several stories that will eventually merge unfold separately.<br /><br />In Nazi-occupied France, SS officer Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), accompanied by several soldiers, comes to a farmhouse in search of Jews who may be hiding there.  He is impeccably uniformed, intimidating, yet polite, even deferential as he speaks with the nervous farmer (Denis Menochet).  Landa questions the farmer  slowly, quietly, yet conveys menace in every syllable.<br /><br />We then switch to Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), in charge of a unit of Jewish-American soldiers whose mission is to instill fear in the German military by brutally killing Nazis and scalping them.<br /><br />Finally, we are introduced to Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), who owns and operates a Paris cinema.  A German officer, Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), sees her and is immediately attracted to her, but she rebuffs his advances until she learns he is a celebrated war hero.<br /><br />Tarantino divides the movie into chapters, taking time to establish characters and make them more than rehashes of previous war movie types.  This is done largely through dialogue, one of Mr. Tarantino's fortes.  Two scenes come to mind.  In one, a group of German soldiers has been attacked by Raine's team.  Many of the Germans have been killed and Raine is questioning their commanding officer about German military installations in the region.  Raine's interview consists of introducing his men and their various unpleasant specialties, and playing a mind game with the officer.  The goal:  finding out where the Germans are entrenched.  The threat:  if you don't reveal this information, there will be severe consequences for you, and they aren't exactly listed in the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br />A second outstanding dialogue sequence is the aforementioned conversation in the farmhouse between the SS officer and the farmer.  From the outset, we mistrust the oily charm of Landa and we know his mission is more than merely asking a few questions and going on his way.  As he speaks calmly in metaphors, we understand his dark intention, ruthless proficiency, and pride in how well he does his job.  The cuts to the soldiers standing outside and various close-ups of the farmer amplify our dread that something awful is imminent.<br /><br />This takes us to the performance by Christoph Waltz, an obscure Austrian actor who undoubtedly undertakes his greatest role ever as the multifaceted, multilingual Landa.  Mr. Waltz understands this character perfectly.  Landa refers to himself as a detective, a Teutonic Sherlock Holmes, though those in the area have given him the nickname "The Jew Hunter."  Waltz takes his time with his dialogue, very much like a kind uncle speaking to a child.  He smiles, laughs a bit, smokes a pipe, gives compliments, and is always courteous to a fault.  That is, until he bares his claws and pounces.  Mr. Waltz is so perfect as Landa, so memorable, that an Oscar nomination is assured.  He adds tremendous stature to "Inglourious Basterds."<br /><br />Brad Pitt's Raine -- a reference to the 1950's actor Aldo Ray, who appeared in many war movies -- is in charge of committing horrible acts, yet because it is wartime and his subjects are the genocidal Nazis, we like him.  Pitt adopts a Tennessee drawl for Raine, which is funny, though the character itself never crosses over into caricature.  None of Tarantino's characters do.<br /><br />Shosanna, who becomes important in the film's third act, has a past that makes her a particularly fierce anti-Nazi, though her feelings must be suppressed until the time is exactly right to reveal them.  Ms. Laurent is attractive, but her role -- despite its importance -- is not as showy as the others.  Her story is a framing device, in a sense, for the entire movie.<br /><br />Mr. Bruhl as Zoller is effective as the golden boy of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth).  His flirtations with Shosanna are initially innocent and charming, but his persistence leads to dire complications.  Diane Kruger turns in an elegant performance as Bridget von Hammersmark, darling of Third Reich cinema.  Beautiful, sophisticated, talented, and widely popular in Germany, Bridget plays a crucial role in an intricate plot.  A scene between Bridget and Col. Landa darkly mirrors a climactic moment in "Cinderella," in another neat Tarantino touch.<br /><br />Blending the three stories smoothly showcases the artistry of Tarantino the writer.  Nothing seems out of place or contrived.  Mulling over the movie afterwards, the viewer may come up with some inconsistencies or flaws, but while the movie is unreeling, our attention is riveted.  Tarantino has mastered the technique of placing what's important to his story in the foreground and banishing bothersome details.  If you're like me, you will be surprised at the movie's finale, something I simply didn't see coming.  For Tarantino's tale, however, it's a smooth, appropriate fit.<br /><br />Rated R for violence and language, "Inglourious Basterds" ranks among Quentin Tarantino's best films.  In style and substance, it most closely resembles "Pulp Fiction."  What you have here is a Class A script with an A-list cast.  As a person sensitive to overly long movies, I can tell you that the two-and-a-half-hour running time flies by.  If anything, I wanted more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to "Death Proof" is a scalpin' good time, and is a pleasant alternate reality of how World War II ended. Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent & Christoph Waltz are pitch-perfect in their roles. Fun movie all the way through. Much better than "Jackie Brown," which was too slow for my taste. But "Pulp Fiction" & "Kill Bill" (I think of it as one movie) were absolutely spot-on, vintage Tarentino, and this glorious movie is right up there with them, ranking as one of his finest. It was also nice to see Achilles & Helen meet for the first time in a movie. The extended and alternate scenes are worth viewing; however, a commentary explaining why the scenes were cut from the film would have worked. SPOILER!!! I so did not expect Zoller to kill Shoshanna. SPOILER OVER!!! It would have been nice also if Shoshanna had killed the French traitor. Just my two cents on what I think should also have occurred in the film. I highly recommend the movie. Let's kill some Nazis. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>when i heard that director quenten tarantino was going to make a film about nazis i was estatic!my brain was buzzing with the possibilities!a director known for his extremely gory and violent films is going to make a nazi movie!nazi movies are notorious for being ultra violent.this would no doubt be the "a clockwork orange" of the new millenium!the movie that was decades ahead of its time.it would be considered too violent even in 30 years.<br />  BUT NO!It was not that violent.it was a bunch of long talking scenes,reading most of the film because it was in german and french and a couple cool fight scenes.<br />  a lot of hype was being built up around the "baseball bat scene".well,ive scene worse violence on "tom and jerry".the scene was over in like 10 seconds  after the 10 minute build up to a highly anti-climatic ending.it was being talked about like it was going to be an all time great movie scene like meg ryan faking an orgasm at the deli.but it was hype and hype only.like they say "everything in hollywood is so fake".<br />  then when there were no action scenes it was all talk.so the movie went talk talk talk talk talk talk.........baseball bat scene........talk talk talk talk talk talk...........nazis.......talk talk talk talk talk........movies...........talk talk talk talk ..........big finale!<br />  there was very little violence.and even less ultra violence.<br />  the actors and actresses were a bunch of people i am mostly unfamiliar with.there was brad pitt who did ok i guess.the chick from "sweeny todd" may have shown up briefly too.the guy who played hitler was paid 3 pennies because thats all he was worth in this film.<br />  also,when all of the nazis were supposed to meet up,a bunch of the big wigs were missing.it was incredibly historicaly innaccurate.the facts were all messed up.especially the end which took the film into an alternate reality.<br />  the violence that was done to the nazis was the same type of stuff that they allegedly did to  thier victims in ww2,making the  so called "good guys" no better than the nazis.<br />  this was supposed to be quenten tarantinos masterpiece.his "mona lisa" or "moonlight sonata".he said it was the film he'd always wanted to make.he'd been planning it for ten years he said.<br />  the childish "get the nazi" antics  that are all too common in movies ever since the 2o's are just plain stupid.they are way too played out in this movie.and if this "masterpiece" was aimed at that juvenile approach and aimed at redefining himself as a snoozer film maker,than he suceeded.<br />  this movie could have been the ultimate ww2 film of all time.easily beating out any ww2 or skin head film in existence.but what it did accomplish was a half baked,watered down,movie that has gone places hundreds of movies already have.<br />  ww2 was bad.the nazis did bad things.everyone knows.so all these childish pokes at someone who cant fight back ,without a time machine, are just infantile.grow up ! try complaining about something from the last half a century!get with the times!you'd think with that gigantic head of his he'd be able to think up the next citizen kane!</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>If you are a devoted fan of the great traditional war films, this movie will drive you nuts.  If you have an open mind to a non-traditional approach which takes extreme liberties with WW II themes, you might find this enjoyable.<br /><br />Chrisoph Waltz is the best movie villain ever!</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Not that I mind talking per se--and Q.T. did a great job with the talking scenes in Pulp Fiction--but here, the scenes of people chatting, socializing, etc. go on much too long and don't add much to the story.  This could have benefited from some trimming here and there; it ends up being 2.5 hours long as it is.<br /><br />Otherwise, Brad Pitt turns in another excellent performance as Aldo, the leader of a small group of Nazi hunters who scalp the Nazis after killing them, though they also release a few of them after carving swastikas on their foreheads as a warning.  Eli Roth is great as his righthand man, and the fellow playing Landa, their primary foe, is outstanding.  The photography in France is very nice, as are the locations; the songs chosen well; and the scenes of violence are actually rather brief and not as graphic as in some of QT's previous work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>Quinten Tarantino has a love hate relationship with the movie going public. He is one of the few major faces in film who wants to make movies his way whether you love them or hate them. His stories are jumbled his humor is crude and to a great deal of dislike he loves to push the bar. In the end he manages to put together a brilliant ensemble cast and always finds ways to take some of the famous names in acting and put them in a role and is out of their element. The outcome just gives fan goose bumps especially with the newest edition to his library.<br /><br />Inglorious Basterds was a movie I was very eager to see. As a Tarantino fan and lover of every film he has directed I was very excited to see a movie about Jewish soldier beating up Nazis. As a member of the Jewish faith and a grandchild of Holocaust survivors there was no doubt in my mind that this was a film that was going to spark tremendous amounts of controversy. Yes, the story told is entirely false and the major Jewish press felt that his work was a shear mockery, but Tarantino stated he had no intentions of making a Holocaust documentary. As a fan of films that involve larger than life heroics, he wanted to give every little Jewish boy and girl a dose of ...dare I say it...Pulp Fiction. These types of stories go back to the days of Superman and Captain America comic books taking down the Nazis and it was done with style and class and Tarantino in my eyes at least didn't push any harsh buttons with me. The acting in this film is awesome, he cast the right people for the right roles especially Christoph Waltz as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. His performance was the best I have seen all year and he really put fear into the movie watchers. I am so happy he was nominated for the golden globe and I sure hope he gets the Oscar nod and wins it. Brad Pitt, I have not seen in a more brilliant role since the stoner in `True Romance'. You also have great performances from Diane Kruger, and yes even Mike Myers! As a Tarantino fan, you get everything you need from Inglorious Basterds. Listen very carefully to some of the voices you hear throughout the film you may get a few awesome surprises.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, Jewish or not it is a must see. It is a pure rush of excitement and that is why we go to the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AV3JZAYAP7GHC.html">AV3JZAYAP7GHC</a><br/><p>Long, boring, pointless. For a film about this crazy commando unit that goes Nazi hunting, there sure was very little of that going on. Just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. About nothing, and mostly from characters who weren't even "The Basterds". I think Brad Pitt and his merry band have a total of 30 minutes screen time in what is an insufferably long film. I should have guessed from the very first scene at the French farmhouse that this was going to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.<br /><br />If you must, out of curiosity or masochism or whatever, see this film for yourself, I highly suggest renting it first.<br /><br />I'm so over Tarantino. He's like the magazine collage maker of film. Just a bunch of stuff done by someone else pasted all over the place.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Inglourious Basterds" is Quentin Tarantino's ironic and fanciful retelling of an episode from World War II. He directed and wrote the film. He's a very imaginative moviemaker who is a fanatical movie buff, very interested in the writing and the dialogue, and he has some American Indian ancestry which will explain a number of features of this film. Sit back and savor the story and the way it is told. It is at times leisurely paced because he wants moviegoers to relish the dialogue. It's a moviegoer's delight with a lot of inside movie stuff going on.<br /> It's a rousing action-adventure yarn, melodramatic, and in the best movie tradition. There's some hammy, over-the-top acting, a lot of violence, and a very cleverly devised screenplay. You'll see flashbacks that help to elucidate the story or characters, and the names of some characters will be telegraphed with written headlines. French and German dialogue is accompanied by subtitles; all of these are trappings which help to validate the narrative. The movie starts with a soundtrack from a Western that may get you in the mood for this serious fantasy.<br /> The scene is set mainly in occupied France in World War II, and you'll see Hitler, Goebells, and the rest of the top Nazi crew.<br /> Central to the the movie's storyline is Colonel Hans Landa, "the Jew Hunter" of the Nazi SS, played by Christopher Waltz who won an Oscar as best supporting actor. At the beginning of the story he is tracking down a Jewish woman, Shosanna, who is hiding out on a French dairy farm. She escapes and later takes over her aunt's art cinema in Paris. A German soldier, Fredrick Zoller, a hero sniper who has killed 350 of Germany's enemies, falls for her. Goebbels has made a propaganda film, "The Nation's Pride", retelling the soldier's exploits, and it's going to be shown in Shosanna's theater at the urging of Fredrick. All the German bigwigs will be at the premiere.<br /> Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine (remember gravelly-voiced Aldo Ray, a movie star a few generations back) who is leading a squad of eight Jewish-American soldiers. They have been parachuted behind enemy lines, and are terrorizing, mutilating and scalping German troops, Apache style.<br /> An Italian movie with the same title was made in 1978. Are we really to take seriously a film in which the German actress and double agent is named Bridget von Hammersmark?<br /> Pitt and his gang are planning to blow up the cinema, but Shosanna is planning her own vengeance. The long scene in the tavern with the British implant and Bridget is suspenseful because we get the feeling that the Brit's German is going to give him away to the SS officer. The scene in which Landa matches a shoe to Bridget's foot is reminiscent of "Cinderella", but so devastatingly different in outcome.<br /> Sit back and let this movie captivate you and don't worry about historical accuracy. It's old-fashioned moviemaking magic at its best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>INGLORIOUS BASTERDS<br /><br />As any one can tell you I am a huge QT fan and basically own everything he has been a part of. So of course when this film was released I had to go see it and the second it was out on DVD/BLU-RAY I had to own it. I knew from the moment this film was announced that it would be another QT classic with out a doubt. Say what you will but it was a major success and you can't discount that at all. I of course knew that I would love this film and of course I did. Call me a Fanboy or what ever but I really did enjoy the film being a QT fan or not.<br /><br />QT had been writing this film for years and was looking to make this one of his best films ever, I think he did just that. Yes there is another film by this name that QT is a big fan of but this is not the same film. I do however recommend seeing that film because it is another fun one. Any way this film has been in the works long before it was released and I think the time spent on it shows. And for those who have for some reason yet to see this film it is not just about that naughty group of American soldiers who go by the films title. No in fact it tells the story of a group of different people who some how or some way all get brought together some how at some point.<br /><br />The film follows of course The Basterds lead by Lt. Aldo Raine [Pitt] in their quest to punish and destroy Nazis across the land. Along with Jewish American soldiers like the Bear Jew [Eli Roth] and even German recruits [you will love one guy]. But others like the brilliant Colonel Hans Landa aka the Jew Hunter [played wonderfully by Christoph Waltz] and Shosanna who later becomes Emmanuelle Mimieux [M&eacute;lanie Laurent]. Add in a film star named Bridget von Hammersmark [Diane Kruger] and a German war hero Frederick Zoller [Daniel Br&uuml;hl] and you have a great film.<br /><br />The film is basically told like a book kinda broke into 5 chapters each continuing the story and bringing them all together at the same time. The first one is set in 1941 while the rest take place in 1944, but rest assured nothing seems out of place at all with the time jump. The chapters are 1.Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied France, 2.Inglourious Basterds, 3.German Night in Paris, 4.Operation Kino, and the explosive 5.Revenge of the Giant Face. Every chapter in my opinion is absolutely perfect. The first one is the introduction of the Jew Hunter in one of the best scenes in the film followed by chapter two which is the introduction of The Basterds. The third one is were we catch up with Shosanna who is now Emmanuelle and her admirer war hero Frederick. Chapter four shows us the actress and her plan to infiltrate a planned Nazi gathering for a film premiere. And finally the grand finish which I will not ruin for those who have yet to see it, excellent.<br /><br />Tarantino has always been known to have great dialogue in his films and this one follows suit, the film is with out a doubt a QT film. The direction is flawless in my humble opinion and how could it be anything less. The cinematography is beautiful and the score is excellent as well, the perfect film is coming together. But it is the performances here that really are great with every one doing a great job. Christoph Waltz is the show stealer as the Jew Hunter and rightfully won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. He is with out a doubt the best thing about this film from the acting stand point and that is really saying something.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is absolutely hilarious in this film is probably the most fun one in the film with the accent and attitude he showcases in the film. All of the Basterds are excellent in this film as one would expect and that includes filmmaker Eli Roth as the Bear Jew. M&eacute;lanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are wonderful in the two female leads for the film as QT has always been able to write strong female characters. Each one is a totally different character with a different life and style but they are more the same then they seem. Martin Wuttke is excellent as Hitler and who could disagree with that, he is hilarious with his little hair bouncing up and down and flopping every were when he is mad.<br /><br />Daniel Br&uuml;hl is also very well cast in the film as a Nazi war hero turned actor who has a thing for M&eacute;lanie Laurent's character. These two are great together and deliver one of the best scenes in the film. Also August Diehl is great in the one scene he is in as a German officer who may or may not be on to our heroes. The fact is every one in this film from the smallest part to the biggest are excellent in this film. I would highly recommend this film especially if you like great acting. Also Lawrence Bender returns as the producer for QT, just one more reason to get this. Go but this film now it is worth much more than a rental. The two disc special edition has some wonderful features from behind the scenes to the film within the film [the war heroes' film]. gotta love that Mike Myers cameo.<br /><br />I waited a long time to see this film and with what was happening in my life around this time I needed an escape.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This movie mixes dynamic plot, vivid scenery, over-the-top characters, shocking violence, and subtle humor in a quirky way that perhaps only Quentin Tarantino could come up with.  In that sense, this movie is very much a reincarnation of Pulp Fiction, although of course the details are all different.<br /><br />This sort of movie can't possibly appeal to everyone, as the broad spectrum of previous reviews attests, but I personally found it highly entertaining and well worth the time.  Indeed, I was so gripped by this movie - frequently wanting to know what was going to happen next but rarely able to predict it - that the time just flew by and it felt like my attention didn't even lapse for a second.  True, some of the violence is hard to watch, but the movie's pervasive aura of humor subtly reminds us that this is make-believe stuff, so that helps to soften the blow (both figuratively and literally).  And of course humor is partly a matter of taste, but I personally found myself laughing out loud many times during this movie (Brad Pitt's character is the funniest in the movie, and I think he nails the role).<br /><br />What are the general lessons from the movie?  I don't think this movie really has any serious aspirations in that direction, but every good movie still has such lessons in there somewhere, so here's my attempt to pull some out:<br /><br />(a) Before harming someone, beware of the possibility of revenge which may far exceed your harm.<br /><br />(b) Ideology can readily drive people to violence which they consider justified, along with willingness to die for a cause.<br /><br />(c) Terrorism can be disproportionately effective, particularly with respect to undermining the morale of the enemy.<br /><br />(d) Occupying a group of people is an inherently dangerous undertaking.<br /><br />(e) People tend to vacillate between allegiance to their personal interest versus the groups to which they belong.<br /><br />(f) History sometimes reaches sensitive points at which outcomes can be drastically changed by seemingly small events.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Tarantino's previous work, and also recommended to others who want to try something different.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of Tarantino. He's always been a man I've respected as a film maker and his collection of films sit comfortably in my list of favourite films of all time. This is one he's been working on for over a decade, refining the script to create his ultimate masterpiece that he was hoping would match the perfection of Pulp Fiction. This sincerely did not disappoint and the wait made it even more special when I got my chance to see it for the first time. Tarantino is sincerely a master of cinema and although some of his more recent films, amongst critics, are generally hit and miss, this is genuinely a masterpiece and displays the man's ability on top form once again.<br /><br />The story unfolds over 5 chapters: Once upon a time... In Nazi occupied France; Inglourious Basterds; A German Night in Paris; Operation Kino and Revenge of the Giant Face. It tells of two separate plots to assassinate Hitler at the same time and place. On the one side we have Emmanuelle Mimieux, a cinema owner with revenge in her heart as her previous name was Shoshanna Dreyfus and she is the only surviving member of her family who were murdered by SS Colonel Hans Landa. The other side focuses on a group lead by Lieutenant Aldo Raine known as the Basterds are a group of Nazi killers who just enjoy killing Nazi's until they find out about a plan to hold a propaganda film premiere in the cinema owned by Emanuelle in which the Fuehrer will be in attendance. This group of Nazi killers are determined to kill the head Nazi, but the question is, will they even get close to their goal?<br /><br />One of Tarantino's main talents is that he has an ear for intense dialogue and can create a lengthy scene which has only that and allow the viewer to be gripped throughout. This is not different as the dialogue in this film is intense and filled with dynamic mood changes and superb acting. Sure, the fact that the dialogue is heavy with subtitles, they work in setting an authentic mood and rather than having the actors play Germans or Frenchmen talking to their fellow countrymen in American accents which would diminish the mood entirely, I personally preferred the subtitles. The first scene of the movie I see it as acknowledging this possibility of subtitle overkill by having Colonel Landa request that the opposing character Perrier LaPadite switch to English as his French was exhausted. Although there was a plot justification for this switch, it was a clever and I found it to be quite a humorous aspect.<br /><br />The acting is sublime, it really is. There are moments when it is slightly camp and the stereotypical traits are a bit over -exaggerated but they add a little relief to what is quite an intense film throughout. The cast are well fitted to their roles, especially Christopher Waltz as "The Jew Hunter" Hans Landa and Brad Pitt as Aldo "The Apache" Raine. They are both comically and seriously believable in their own right and add a lot to the film individually. The talk that Waltz should gain an academy award for his role in this film is well deserved and I pray he receives that nomination and ultimately the award. The supporting cast members such as Eli Roth, Mike Myers, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent and Martin Wuttke add their own individual flairs to the film to make it a genuinely pleasant experience.<br /><br />There is also certainly a western movie style influence with the film and you know it's a Tarantino film the minute it begins. He has an individuality with his films that allows you to notice instantly that he had a hand in putting this masterpiece together. This is definitely an Oscar worthy film that I would strongly recommend to anybody with an ounce of respect for truly marvellous film making. For the HD fans there are the elements that take advantage of this, especially with the beautifully vibrant scenery. So get it, you will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I bought this Blu Ray set some time ago, but I wanted to forget the wide range of reviews I had read before seeing it. 'Inglorious Barsterds' is a very good film and I think Tarantino fans should especially like it. I think my biggest gripe with this film is the subtitles. It's not that I can't deal with them, but having scenes with long dialogue with so many written words at the bottom of the screen, was overall distracting and kept me from watching the scene. I know why the subtitles are used, but I think they could have used some clever ideas like in the first scene to break it up a little. I may not be the fasted reader on the planet, but I can hold my own. If you're watching this film, you had better be prepared to keep your eyes glues to the screen and don't even think of looking away to grab some popcorn for a second or you may lose some vital information. I know some lines were so long I could barely finish reading before I had another paragraph to read!<br /><br />Aside from the subtitles I think the film is beautifully shot and the acting by all is excellent. I enjoyed the story even though those "Basterds" aren't in the film as much as I would have liked them to be. I know some thought the length of the film was a bit long, but I really think the massive subtitling made it feel long. If I want to read a book, I'll read a book but when I watch a film I want to watch the actors expressions and actions. This film has so much subtitling that you can't really do that ,.....for those of you that can read a paragraph in a millisecond...my hat's off to you, but I think this film would have been better received by all, if they had found a way to switch to English more often. One of the joys of watching Tarantino films is to listen to his wonderful dialogue, not necessarily read it. Films like Schindler's List certainly didn't suffer from not using subtitles and I don't think this film would have either. The Blu Ray looks very good and there are some very good extras including alternate scenes, making of etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>Quinten Tarantino has attempted The Great American Novel in his "Inglourious Basterds." What, you say, a movie, not a novel?<br /><br />Yes, it's a movie, but consider: (please note that my descriptors are not definitive---the nature of the novel shape-shifts)<br />1. It acts like a novel (chapters, different settings, many characters, complicated plot lines that converge for the final unraveling--this also is not a necessity),<br />2. It "reads" like a novel (actual chapter divisions and much dialogue--neither is required),<br />3. It has a central conflict (ridding the world of Nazis, concluding with a mighty clever resolution),<br />4. It falls into its own literary genre (the re-imagination of a world event into a fantasia of Pulp Fiction proportions), sooooooo, what is it? Crime fantasy? Fantasia of evil? Revenge documentary spliced with actual footage? Historical fiction---no---make that historical fantasy? See what I mean?<br />5. It is long at two hours and 40 minutes (not all novels are long)<br /><br />OK, granted, "Inglourious Basterds" IS a movie about actual events, but ones re-imagined, re-considered, re-invented and put back together as something new. It becomes novel in that its very first scene is  bathed in quiet undertones of civilized dialog, loaded with the machine-gun staccato of impending violence. The viewer asks how? when? Then comes the blasting of visual imagery, and an escape that becomes a pivot of more violence. What is new under the sun? According to the Prophet, nothing. The theme Tarantino considers is this: What is evil? Who has it? Who does it? What are the results?<br /><br />In some ways Tarantino's script is a Picasso masterpiece: that taking apart of history, then distorting it into something new: deconstruction reconstructed. Call it Taranting. Tarantino likes to "tarant." Take something out of modern life: hits by hitmen, violence for violence's sake, mass genocide. Then take that whatever and make it into something new. It's this step that makes Tarantino so prominent and admired in film-making. Pulp Fiction becomes a philosophizing about the nature of life. Reservoir Dog becomes a caricature of man's violent nature, and Inglourious Basterds becomes a poison-dripped commentary on genocide, violence for violence's sake, a reversal of all things decent into all things evil and vile, switching making no difference especially in the character of the German SS officer.<br /><br />These reasons (cited above) are why Brad Pitt is so good in his role. He plays it with gusto, with exaggeration, with sanity swathed in insanity, with evil run amok. Pitt plays his role with exactly the right nasty machismo and vulgarity and lasciviousness required by Tarantino's taranting. He should win an Academy Award nomination (at least) for this bold acting job. Many viewers miss this point and call him a caricature, his role as silliness. I suggest: Think again. Would Tarantino allow Pitt to diss his taranting?<br /><br />As for the conclusion: It was good to see the good guys win. Wait a minute. Did they?</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>I can tell by reading the reviews on this site that this movie is a love it or hate it thing; Some people found all the dialog and set-up boring, the subtitles a pain in the butt to read, and there was not enough action in this 2 1/2 hour epic film.<br /><br />I, however, thought otherwise. In fact, I would even say that this is Tarantino's best and most mature film despite the premise of 'killing Nazis'. I think many people thought that this was going to be the main premise of the movie, just slaughtering German's left and right. In fact, I do think that the ad campaign for this movie was a little misleading in that respect.<br /><br />This film is all about the dialog, the settings, and waiting for the outcome you know is coming. A great ensemble cast and the use of subtitles only add to the realism, and there is no shortage of either the trademark Quentin humor or sudden bursts of unexpected violence.<br /><br />For those expecting another Kill Bill, they will be sorely disappointed. But for those who are looking for smart, intense, well-acted WW2 drama w/a few unexpected surprises, this is the film for you. It is one of remarkable depth, and it is almost hard to believe Tarantino made it....in a good way.  A thick, rewarding film. Beautifully filmed, too.  The images on blu-ray really come to life; the theater just did not do this movie justice in terms of the visuals.<br /><br />I have watched this 6 times already, and I am sure I will watching it again soon. But that's me.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino hit this one out of the park.  We picked this up to watch with friends and before we started watching it, I cringed when I learned that one of these friends was squeamish when it comes to Tarantino films, but to her credit she was willing to give it a viewing.<br /><br />Chapter One (worth the price of the DVD) sucked in the group of us with riveting performances, dialog, and cinematography.  It set the tone for the rest of the film.<br /><br />I know a lot of other viewers dinged the film slightly for Quentin's little idiosyncrasies.  That doesn't bother me a bit, in fact I've come to expect them.  They're just his way of putting his stamp on the film.<br /><br />What was most striking to me, was the fact that Tranantino is perfecting (given the right story) his craft.  The way he built up the scenes to shocking, often surprising conclusions was phenomenal.<br /><br />The actors' performances were outstanding, though Brad Pitt is included more for comic relief than anything else.  Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent easily stole this film. The film was more about story and performance, masterfully told, than violence.  The squeamish friend enjoyed it, and Quentin seems to have redeemed himself in her eyes.<br /><br />Stunning cinema!</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Who doesn't love a good Nazi killing outing.  This film is great, it grabs you by the throat and doesn't let up until the credits start rolling like most awesome films made by Quint.  This is now my fav Brad Pitt movie and all the actors in this film played their roles very well,  even Hitler was spot on.  The action was great, the effects were very well done and the realism was great, no corners cut here, honest and brutal.

For those who admire the strangely off kilter Quentin Tarantino's films, this may just appeal as his best and fanciest production yet.  It is a way over the top story about revenge as carefully served out by Jewish American soldiers known as Inglourious Basterds on the Nazis who during the occupation of France sought out and murdered thousands of Jews.  This may sound like a grim topic for an entertaining film, but in Tarantino's hands it becomes not only a grisly look at reality but also an at times hilarious parody.<br /><br />The cast is almost secondary to the story: Brad Pitt as the leader Lt Aldo Raine sports a scarred throat and a somewhat tiresome Tennessee accent but seems to enjoy every grisly moment of his command to have all members of his division gather 100 scalps from the Nazi killers; Denis Menochet provides a sensitive opening as the French father who is hiding Jews (namely one Shosanna Dreyfus-  M&eacute;lanie Laurent - whose escape from her family's slaughter begins the lead seed for the story ahead), Mike Myers portraying a German parody as only he can, Daniel Br&uuml;hl, Marin Wuttke as a pitch perfect Hitler, B.J. Novak as Pitt's sidekick, Sylvester Groth as Goebbels, etc.  But the crowning actor in this film is the amazingly gifted Christoph Waltz as the multilingual, sinister, smarmy, yet elegant Col. Hans Landa who drives this wild tale to its grisly conclusion.<br /><br />As with all Tarantino films this is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is surprising how entertaining this sprawling story is in his hands.  It goes on a bit long and is chocked full of grisly incidents, but it is fine film making.  Grady Harp, December 09</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>Being a fan of previous Tarantino works (mainly Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown), WWII combat films and westerns, I expected to like Basterds a lot more than I did. As you already know from trailers and ads, the film is a lavishly-produced and violent revenge fantasy centered around a plot to take out the Nazi High Command. Basterds has the look of film-making of yesteryear, drawing inspiration and stylistic influences from such sources as the classic 1967 film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O176IO">The Dirty Dozen</a>, spaghetti westerns and "macaroni combat" films (a sub-genre of films produced by Italian directors of the mid-60's). Like all Tarantino films, it is filled with wonderfully inventive, humorous (and sometimes rambling) dialog, quirky narrative pacing, and a cast of memorable characters. And of course, lots of hidden references and punctuated by great music.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the film, there are actually two main story branches: the more publicized one concerning the Basterds, and another revolving around a young Jewish woman named Shoshana who is living in Paris under an assumed name and identity. Her story comes first. In Chapter 1, we are introduced to the film's main antagonist, a charming, highly intelligent, and charismatic SS Colonel named Hans Landa, nicknamed "The Jew Hunter" for his ruthless efficiency. He visits a French farmhouse where a teenage Shoshana and her family are being hidden. Shoshana is the only survivor of that encounter. She flees, but with a clear opportunity to kill her, Landa lets her escape.<br /><br />Next, we cut to Chapter 2 where we see Lt. Aldo Raine (played by a miscast Brad Pitt) recruiting a unit of Jewish American soldiers to engage in guerrilla operations deep within Axis-controlled France, spreading terror through the Nazi ranks with their ambush tactics and brutality. We see them clubbing Nazi soldiers to death with baseball bats and taking of scalp, shown very graphically. Pitt's performance and mannerisms as a hardened military man from Tennessee (complete with Southern drawl) is not completely convincing, reminding me of his character from 12 Monkeys instead. My major criticism here is with the character development. It's very lacking, in my opinion. We only get a brief vignette/flashback of Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), called out by name in a 60's movie font. We don't get much of a backstory for Aldo or any of the other 7 basterds except Stiglitz, giving us very little emotional investment. Not all of them make it through the film.<br /><br />Next, we have the British coming into play, hatching up "Operation Kino" (German for "cinema"), a joint operation with the Basterds to blow up a movie theater where Hitler and his top commanders will be attending a film screening of Joseph Goebbels' newest propaganda film. Mike Meyers makes a cameo appearance as a British General, sounding a bit like Austin Powers with his fake accent. Unknown to the Allies, Shoshana hatches a plot of her own and we return to her in the fifth and final chapter as she sets her plans in motion and the remaining parties converging for a final fateful encounter, all set to David Bowie's bellowing "Putting Out Fire" (a song originally written for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HZO">Cat People</a>). It's wonderfully anachronistic and appropriate, as is almost all of the musical choice in the film, which blends rock riffs, Spanish guitar, and too many styles for me to identify.<br /><br />Austrian actor Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant as Landa and is expected to get an Oscar tap for his command performance. Cold, calculating, beguilingly charming, and nuanced, Tarantino says Landa is perhaps his greatest character. Waltz infuses the character with complexity, humor, and wit. He really makes this movie.<br /><br />Stylistically, the film is beautiful shot, visually convincing, and full of that trademark Tarantino flare. It's a very enjoyable experience if you like his work and WWII films in general, but I felt Pitt was miscast and not totally believable in his role. The basterds needed more character development if we are to care about their fates. We get very little personality information to go on here, and the film treated them as expendables. Even if the army did, the film shouldn't have treated them as disposables if we are to make a two and a half hour investment in watching this film and in the characters. Overall, I enjoyed this film, but it could've been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>Inglourious Basterds is, without a doubt, Tarantino's masterpiece.  In fact, not to jinks him or wish him anything but the best in future endeavors, but it is my opinion the odds of him surpassing what he has achieved in this film are slim indeed.<br /><br />While there have been numerous complaints (even in the most complimentary of reviews) of the many incongruous elements found throughout the film, I have found it is the very disparity of those elements that tie this film into a unifying whole - and precisely what makes it one of the most satisfactory films and satisfying movie experiences of 2009.  It is this genre-busting, "what is it?" quality that makes it unique among the major players of this year's top films.<br /><br />Visually, Tarantino has done nothing to date that quite matches the opulence he achieves here a tailor made look evocative of the "Grand Hollywood Style" of those glorious Technicolor epics of the 50's, 60's and 70's.  Like those, every frame of "Inglorious Basterds" seems worthy of being reproduced as "art" in its own right.  The color spectrum he employs throughout is rich and vivid in that 1950's fashion - simultaneously lurid yet beautiful.<br /><br />He elicits performances from his cast that are among the most memorable seen in years.  The arc of the Shoshana story - Melanie Laurent in a powerfully searing performance that throbs with a ferocious intensity, anchors the various chapters of the film brilliantly.  That performance is matched (and maybe even surpassed) by her chief tormentor, in the guise of Austrian actor Christopher Waltz as Hans Landa of the SS.  Waltz, in fact, makes one of the most amazing film debuts in American film history.  Chilling doesn't begin to describe his performance here.<br /><br />Not to be outdone by her costars, Diane Kruger gets to star in one of Tarantino's most brilliantly conceived scenes from any of his films - the basement bar scene.  As the unlikely (and hilariously) named Bridget Von Hammersmark, Kruger gives her finest performance since Joyeux Noel and proves herself both as comedian and grand tragedienne.<br /><br />The Basterds - headed by Brad Pitt - have found some critics singling theirs out to be the weakest element of the movie, but I disagree.  Strongly.  While the danger of the European war front can be elegantly confusing throughout the entire film (e.g., the almost Andrew Wyeth spareness of the opening chapter; the inviting danger of the basement bar; the opulence of the Cinetheque, etc.) the sheer audacity and brutality of the scenes with the Basterds adds a provocatively American feel to the story's proceedings.<br /><br />The Basterds are almost a comic chorus line -  not quite interchangeable archetypes in a film otherwise populated with specific and memorable characters.  Of course several of them (including Mr. Pitt) get to partake in a finale that is (even by Tarentino standards) so over the top it is nothing if not jaw dropping.  The entire finale offers one of the most hauntingly beautiful and memorable scenes modern cinema has had to offer in a very long time.<br /><br />Mr. Tarantino paints all of this onto the broadest canvas possible using a palette that combines the almost unseemly mixtures of film noir, slapstick, crude comedy, art house film, historical fiction, James Bond-style slickness, buddy pic and action flick seemingly without a fleeting concern as to what anybody else thinks.  It's a "take no prisoners" style of filmmaking that (clearly) does not play to all tastes and demands that it be taken on its own terms.  If one is willing to take that journey with him the rewards are remarkable and immeasurable.  A truly remarkable film achievement.  Bravo, Signor Tarantino!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>Just for those thinking it's sacrilegious for Mr. Tarantino to have invented a alternative, B-movie version of WWII history, I say go fly a kite.<br /><br />In fact, I wish Mr. Tarantino would make several more such movies, playing fast and loose with various periods of history until we get it through our heads that doing this opens up creative avenues of insight and adventures that we currently deny ourselves.  Authors in previous ages certainly wouldn't have scrupled.<br /><br />But the thing seems thematically uneven to be considered great.  From what I read, Tarantino took 10 years to write this, and it shows.  They say you shouldn't take that long to write something, because there are too many changes in the author himself during such a time.  Thus what you finally come up with is likely to be stylistically and thematically clunky.  (Think of Moby-Dick:  unfortunate that the author went through so many changes while writing that.)<br /><br />It's like Tarantino was at times trying to do this, at other times trying to do that.  In the end we get something that doesn't cohere stylistically and is only intermittently entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Just when I feared that Tarantino may be heading towards the same fate as M.

This bluray version is also excellent coming in reference disc quality with impeccable picture and wonderful DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound quality as well.  The extra disc containing the digital copy is useless to me and although the special feature documentaries aren't anything really to shout about, the quality of the main disc alone makes this a worthy addition to your blu-ray video library.  Historical and yet far from being historically accurate, this film is very enjoyable and while not quite in the same league as "Pulp Fiction" this film still ranks highly among the more recent studio releases.<br /><br />Great Tarantino script, excellent reference quality picture and sound makes this blu ray a highly recommended addition to your video library.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>In addition to the great acting and good direction, the Blu-Ray transfer, for those of you interested in that, was the best I've ever seen - just flawless.<br /><br />The movie was up for eight Academy Awards so you know there were a lot of aspects to it that were done well, from the acting to the photography to the sound and screenplay.  Yet - see below - I had read a lot of negative reviews on this movie and really wasn't anxious to see it.  I only saw it because it was free at the library. Afterward, I was so impressed I bought a copy.<br /><br />As I reflected upon this film, I realized how good it must have been to keep my interest as well as it did for two-and-a-half hours of mostly dialect and a lot of it with subtitles.<br /><br />It made me realize just how intense and good the actors were in this film, all of them with a lot to offer. Brad Pitt is the "big name" of the group, and his character is really strange, but there is an "unknown" German actor in here, Christopher Waltz, who stole the show as "Col. Hans Landa, The Jew Killer." He was just mesmerizing, particularly in the opening scene which was incredibly tense. I'm glad to find out he won an Oscar for his performance.<br /><br />Melanie Laurent wasn't far behind as far as good acting and an interesting character as she played the beautiful-and-vengeful "Shossona Dreyfus/Emmanuel Mimieux."</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>The only reason I don't give this film a 5 is I could have done without the in-your-face graphic violence.  But it's Tarrantino, so it's to be expected.  The direction on this is fabulous, the acting, the story, the pacing, the cinematic appeal...  It's really an interesting perspective, retelling a Nazi-era drama, though as one should expect, the underlying details are gritty, ugly, and sometimes gross.  The convergence of subplots into the primary story is well done and exciting.  If you're OK with Tarrantino's needful spin of fetish-cum-violence, this film will not disappoint, and may leave you thinking about how war criminals are really treated in our culture.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I liked the movie "Inglourious Basterds," which is a humorous and violent retelling of World War II history.

MY GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino returns to form with "Inglorious Basterds," an uber-violent World War II revenge fantasy, modeled, at least in part, on "The Dirty Dozen."<br /><br />Brad Pitt, replete with noose-scarred neck and Southern drawl, plays Aldo Raine, a lieutenant in the U.S. military, who's recruited a band of Jewish mercenaries - dubbed the Inglorious Basterds - to roam the war torn countryside killing Nazis then removing their scalps as souvenirs.  The few who are allowed to survive have a swastika carved into their foreheads as a warning to all future victims that the boys are coming to get them.<br /><br />The "basterds" get their best opportunity to inflict maximum damage when Goebbels agrees to premiere one of his Nazi propaganda films in a theater in occupied France, a premiere at which just about anyone who's anyone among the German high command - including Der Fuhrer himself - will be in attendance.  The plan is for the "basterds" to go in and annihilate virtually the entire Nazi regime in one fell swoop.<br /><br />After years in which we've watched Jews in WWII films being marched off helplessly to death camps, "Inglorious Basterds" provides an almost purgative function by letting us see the victims finally doling out some long overdue, eye-for-an-eye justice to their murderous oppressors - even if it's a retribution largely consigned to the realm of fantasy and fiction (though the recent "Defiance" obviously provided us with a factual account of just such a turnabout).<br /><br />Interestingly, though, despite their having star billing in the title, the "basterds" themselves are actually accorded a surprisingly small amount of screen time in the movie, so that anyone going into it expecting nonstop violent action scenes centered around the group's activities may be sorely disappointed.  In reality, much more of the movie's 152-minute running time is devoted to the story of a beautiful Jewess (Melanie Laurent) who, after escaping death at the hands of a sadistic SS colonel (the brilliant Christopher Waltz in his bravura Oscar-winning performance), is now, as the owner of the theater where the movie will be shown, in a unique position to exact her revenge, both for herself and for all her people who have suffered under this brutal regime (her plan is to burn the theater down with all the Nazis inside).<br /><br />Tarantino has self-consciously divided his screenplay into five subtitled chapters.  The scenes within each chapter run long and all take place in a single setting, but they are rarely static, thanks to Tarantino's skill at composition, his penchant for crackling dialogue, and the suspense that arises organically from the situations being dramatized.  Still, this is far from a fast-paced action-movie crowd-pleaser, so one should be forewarned that a certain amount of patience is required from the viewer.<br /><br />Episodic in structure and deliberate in its pacing - with a healthy dose of black humor and a soundtrack just anachronistic enough to provide the imprimatur of "coolness" one demands from a Tarantino film - "Inglorious Basterds" provides an imperfect but imaginative spin on World War II "history."</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>The opening scene in this movie was brilliant and must not be missed.<br />The story is about a Jewish girl who escapes the Germans as they massacre her family.<br />The movie is a fictionalized version of what could have happened had a Jewish army unit had entered France with the sole intent of killing as many Nazis as possible and finally succeeding in ending the war, when they end up blowing up a theater, which is now owned by the Jewish girl who had escaped, in which the entire top leadership of the Third Reich has assembled to watch a propaganda film.<br />The film, although long is laid out in easy chapters like a book. Tarantino uses wonderful and complex dialogue to guide the film. I loved the exchange of words in the first scene between the French farmer and the Nazi officer SS Hans Landa ( Christoph Waltz) .The action is minimal but at times is very gruesome and bloody. The costumes are splendid and the locations are spectacular as well. Brad Pitt plays his part well and is ably supported by all the basterds. Mike Myers is in a tiny role as a British officer and I feel that he was wasted.<br />I felt that the highlights of the film were the opening scene, the shootout at the tavern, and the wonderful just ending. If I were to watch the film in a movie theater it would be to see Christoph Waltz who is simply brilliant as the shrewd, chilling, sinister, opportunist and always on the alert SS officer Hans Landa. I had never seen him perform before but this could easily be the best portrayal of evil in recent times. He alone is the worth the price of the ticket and popcorn and cannot imagine this movie without him in it. I liked the movie and I gave it four stars. 3/28/10</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS<br /><br />STARRING: Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth, Daniel Bruhl, Jacky Ido, Til Schweiger, Gedeon Burkhard, Mike Myers (yes as in Austin Powers; no joke) and the voices of: Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Quentin Tarantino<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Quentin Tarantino<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Drama<br />Release Date: 21 August 2009<br /><br />Despite having the word `inglourious' (yes, I am aware it is miss-spelled; so is basterds) in its title; Quentin Tarantino's latest `artsy' bloodbath Inglourious Basterds, is anything but inglorious. Behind only Public Enemies, this would be my second pick for the best movie of 2009.<br /><br />I'm such a huge fan of Tarantino's work, that I even give much praise to the continuously bashed and ridiculed Jackie Brown. Being rumored to have the nerve to walk up and personally hand-deliver a copy of his first script Reservoir Dogs, to actor Harvey Keitel; Tarantino is truly one of a kind.<br /><br />Any book on screenwriting will tell you that dialogue is supposed to be lean and that more is less. Thank God for his audience, Quentin Tarantino pays no matter to this ridiculous rule of Hollywood's thumb. The man has orchestrated some of the longest, intense, comedic and character driven tangents of dialogue, the face of cinema has ever seen. There is no shortage of them in Inglourious Basterds.<br /><br />The film begins with one in fact, and it was one of my favorite moments. We meet a French man who lives on a farm with his daughters during World War II. He is visited by the notorious Nazi, Colonel Hanz Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. The two sit and have a chat over a smoke from a pipe and a glass of refreshing milk. Their conversation? The details as to whether or not the man is hiding Jews under the floorboards of his small cottage. I won't reveal as to whether or not he is, but let's just say that what happens next sets up the entire second and third acts.<br /><br />Not long after, we meet the `Basterds.' They are a group of Jewish and American soldiers "dropped into France, dressed as civilians." Their mission - "One thing, and one thing only... killin' Nazis."<br /><br />Their leader is Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and he's one tough cookie. He has a heinous scar across his throat; the origin of which is never revealed to us. He seeks no greater pleasure in life, than hunting down and brutally killing and then scalping Nazis.<br /><br />Don't get too excited by this though; the only real complaint for the film I have, is there was not enough time with the `Basterds' being `Basterds.' Others would agree with me, in that we would have liked to see a few more scenes of them being `inglourious', to the Nazis. Luckily, Tarantino is already working on a prequel.<br /><br />I won't even go into any further details of the plot, as it would be virtually impossible to do without revealing crucial spoilers. I will say that is wildly entertaining and out there; as is to be expected from the mind of Tarantino.<br /><br />It will no doubt trump the Academy Awards; taking home Oscars for best picture, best director, cinematography and best original screenplay. I'd be willing to bet a small fortune that the amazing performance of Christoph Waltz as the disturbed Colonel Hanz, has already justified the engraving of his name on the Oscar for best supporting actor. He was electrifying and flawless in every scene. Tarantino had been working on this script since the early 90s, and is rumored to have put it on the back burner because he couldn't find the right `Hanz.' I think it's safe to say, he made the right choice.<br /><br />I was not at all surprised to find Brad Pitt blowing me away, yet again. The guy has perfected his craft to a serene art-form and you root for him the entire time. His accent and the persona he has given this character were hilarious.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the appearance of Mike Myers in the film, I do have something to say about it. I'm not quite sure if it's a comment to him or not, but I mean no disrespect when I say: I can't take him seriously. He is just too funny. Much like Will Ferrell, regardless of how dramatic he is attempting to be - I am laughing.<br /><br />I'd further like to point out that Tarantino is well aware that this film is a work of fiction. Yes; there is no recording in history of the things that are partaken upon in this film. It's a movie. But we have seen countless `based on...', war films in the past. This is a new idea. A `what if' idea; and I can't think of anything more interesting then Tarantino's vision: what if LT Raine and the Basterds had whipped out Hitler and the Nazis?</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>Good movie with more strength than weakness.  The story is interesting and fun to follow and a lot of performances by unknown actors (to me at least) are better than that of the big names.  Pitt was fun at times, but didn't really cut it as a general - somehow he still seems too young and pop and I think even he was having a hard time believing his over the top accent.  While so many of the other actors in this World War II France put in believable top notch performances, I'd pop right out of the spell when Pitt and the gang came on though they occasionally added comic relief which may have been the point partly.  I agree with other reviews that call the Pitt factor a weak link in a film that almost could have been a masterpiece.  Still it's Tarrantino's style not to play it straight all the time, even amidst seriousness - the quirkiness that Pitt and his scalping crew brought to the movie sometimes did add an enjoyable fast food element.  And you know we love fast food but you don't confuse it for fine dining. This was a movie half sirloin, half hamburger - actually a formula that often produces success.  I just wonder how it would have been if they'd used different "hamburger".<br /><br />Good work by many actors, supporting and otherwise, the film was suspenseful, fairly clever and finally quite entertaining.  Some of the best performances in this movie came from those playing Nazis - like a good mafia movie, there's so much tension beneath the pleasantries.  Both leading ladies were good as well.  This is the first Tarantino film I've seen since Pulp Fiction that I've felt half enthused about. While not perfect, it had an element that has long been missing from his films - substantial story and interesting characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>Historically accurate? No, it's really not intended to be a documentary... Violent? Very, not for kiddies... typical 1.5 hr. length? No, thankfully...Entertaining? It is, I enjoyed it. Nice work Mr. Tarantino, I got it. I think if you are a fan of his other movies and understand he beats to a different drum you'll also like this movie. A blend of comedy, drama, & action set in the early 40's w/ some cool camera angles. Only thing I didn't like was the subtitles b/c I found myself pausing the movie a lot to read them, however the german & french dialog does add to the authentic setting of the movie. A to the point ending, excellent acting from the German SS Col. played by Christoph Waltz.

This movie provides most of them.<br /><br />1.  Large amounts of blood and violence.  This movie is very violent.  If you want to see people brained with batch, scalped and slashed to a point where it attempts to desensitize you then this is the picture for you.<br /><br />2.  Interesting Villains:  Tarantino's film got a lot of good press in Germany, mostly because it portrays Germans and Nazi in a much more sympathetic way then we have seen.  We see men conflicted by killing, unwilling to save their own lives to compromise others.  As for the primary villain although his own evil is established early he is portrayed more as a German Holmens than a simple Nazi slaying Jews.<br /><br />3.  Violent Heroes:  The Americans in this movie are very violent as are their allies, they are Jews getting revenge and they aren't shy about getting it.<br /><br />4.  Offbeat comedy:  A lot of what happens is presented in a comical fashion.  You will find yourself laughing at times that will surprise you.<br /><br />If these elements are not to your liking, you won't care for the film, if they are you will enjoy it.<br /><br />and might I add the ending totally surprised me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>"Inglourious Basterds"<br />Directed by Quentin Tarrantino<br />(2009)<br />----------------------------------------------<br />In this delicious genre film, Quentin Tarrantino pays tribute to the classic war movies of the 1950s and '60s, made with the same grandiose aura of faux-epic presentation, draped over a palpably ridiculous plot. The film opens slowly, with Tarrantino employing great restraint and craftsmanship, using beautiful landscape cinematography and slow, deliberate pacing. The camera lingers on the brilliant Austrian actor Christoph Waltz (who steals the show: he was nominated for a "supporting actor" Oscar, but he is clearly the movie's real star, playing a vain, sadistic SS officer who loves elaborate cat-and-mouse games.)<br /><br />Tarrantino also uses misdirection in the film -- the Dirty Dozen-ish commando group of the film's title actually get little screen time, and are quickly decimated by their Nazi foes; Brad Pitt, the nominal star of the show, does very little onscreen and has few lines (although he looks a lot like Clark Gable, which is fun...)  Also, despite the marketing campaign, there isn't that much graphic violence: again, this is probably a conscious homage to the war epics of the '60s, which featured a lot of set-up before their Rube Goldberg-like climaxes, where the grand plan unfolds. The ending, which is preposterous and ahistorical, is a real hoot, a gratifying anti-Nazi wish-fulfillment... Like the film itself, it's pure entertainment and fantasy. And why not? Isn't that what films are supposed to be about?  This isn't immortal art, but it sure is a fun movie. If you grew up watching old war films on Saturday afternoons and afterschool TV blocks, then this flick is for you. Tarrantino really nailed it.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>This is an interesting, well-plotted, fascinating film that won't be to everyone's tastes. It centers around all sorts of goings-on during WWII with a plot that's incredibly intricate and nastily violent.<br /><br />The movie features several stories that eventually lock together. You've got the Nazi "Jew Hunter",played by Christoph Waltz (in one of the best performances of the year. Before seeing this I was prepared to say the Best Supporting Actor win would go to Christian McKay for his performance in "Me and Orson Welles". Now I'm not so sure), a Jewish woman (M&eacute;lanie Laurent)who survived a massacre of her family led by the "Jew Hunter" (what is that in German? "Juden Jaeger", I assume), and then, almost as an afterthought, you've got an American guerrilla group led by one Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who offers one of the most hilarious moments in the film when he speaks Italian with a very thick Tennessee accent.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the plot without giving away huge parts of the movie. Suffice to say the Basterds are sent across enemy lines to wreak havoc against the Nazis (which they do rather graphically). Meantime the Jew Hunter is oozing his way across the landscape and the Jewish woman he failed to kill is running a movie theatre. When the Nazis decide to premiere a movie there, she makes plans to blow it up.<br /><br />As usual with Tarantino, there's lots of blood and gore, plus plenty of references to other movies. The soundtrack is like a Spaghetti Western, there's an appearance by Emil Jannings, references to the works of Leni Riefenstahl and mention of the great German film studio UFA. Left out are comments on the works of Murnau and Lang, but given the Nazi view of Lang especially, that's no great surprise.<br /><br />As mentioned the movie tells several stories all at once. It is a testament to Tarantino as a filmmaker that I never once felt lost and that the stories come together in a way that seems quite natural.<br /><br />I'm no great Tarantino fanboy. "Reservoir Dogs" and "Kill Bill" (both parts), remain to me some of the most overrated films in history. I didn't like either one. On the other hand, "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown" are two of my all-time favorite films, so there you go.<br /><br />The DVD extras include some deleted scenes (though fewer than you'd expect), as well as trailers and a six-minute short film done in the style of Riefenstahl. It's less interesting than one might want.<br /><br />Ultimately I recommend this movie. It's a tad on the violent side (to put it mildly), but well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_Inglourious Basterds_ (2009) is perhaps Quentin Tarantino's most bizarre film.  The film effectively shows that there is no bigger industry than "Nazi exploitation".  From Godwin's law to Schindler's List, it seems that Hitler and his cronies are the perennial topic of conversation for all right-thinking people.  It is difficult to say overall whether this film is a spoof or not.  The film features a group of "Basterds" led by an Apache Indian and some Jews whose job it is to go around scalping Nazis.  The film focuses on the misadventures of the "detective" Jew hunter SS man, as he attempts to prevent a plot by the Basterds to destroy the Nazis.  Ultimately, the detective comes across as such a despicable character in the film that you are glad he deserves his ultimate fate.  The ending is exceedingly strange.  Not historically correct.  And the message seems to be that every "living" "Nazi" needs a Charles Manson type swastika engraved in their head, because a "Nazi is always a Nazi". When will we forget?  2.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the "Basterds", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history. "Inglorious Basterds" tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. The entertainment and laughter is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. Tarantino delivers, and this movie does not disappoint.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>When Mike Tyson was in his heyday, he had many of his opponents beaten before they even got into the ring.  You see, it was Tyson's reputation that intimidated them.  I believe this is what we have when it comes to Quentin Tarantino's films; it is his reputation for being an "auteur" that proceeds his releases.  People think this a guy who does "out of the box," conglomerations of spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation films, his quirky musical tastes, etc. and mixes it all together-and according to them, out comes a great movie.  "Inglourious Basterds" is one of those films, BUT closer examination reveals the film does have flaws.  Tarantino gets away with long, boring scenes of dialog building up to a climactic event just because he is, well, Tarantino.  Another filmmaker would simply be taken to task for these trangressions, but we're dealing with a "genius" here, so he gets a free pass by critics and fans.  IB does have much to crow about: beautiful cinematography, great action scenes (when they finally show up), and good performances, but film is all about timing and pacing, and this is where the movie loses focus.  No doubt Tarantino devotees will say "but that is how he does it," but to me and many other moviegoers it's still plodding at a snails pace.  In the end, "Inglourious Basterds" just moved to slowly for me to really enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:24 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie "Inglourious Basterds", written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Well, I think other reviewers have already done a terrific job discussing the story and numerous movie references in Quentin Tarantino's latest film "Inglourious Basterds," so I will make my review brief. The real star of "Inglourious Basterds" is neither Brad Pitt nor Diane Kruger. It is Christoph Waltz as COL. Hans Landa, whose great performance deserves its own film.<br /><br />From the moment he steps into a farmer's house in occupied France (very intense Chapter 1, the best part of the film), we know Tarantino made a right choice. When the film is not boring, his character - smooth-talking, cunning and chilling - is always there. (Almost equally great is Michael Fassbender and the gripping basement scene involving his LT. Archie Hicox should not be missed.)<br /><br />Probably those who have seen his "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" must know what is coming in Tarantino's take of a WWII-revenge story set in alternate Europe. Lots of violence have become a kind of trademark of the director (and I personally don't think it is a bad thing for any director), but the violence in his previous movies has never been tasteless like this. Scalping? Hitting a defenseless man with a bat? Surely cinema wins the war, but in a very inglourious way.<br /><br />This brings me back to where I started: Christoph Waltz. I can forget the tedious dialogues, pointless movie references (Brad Pitt as Aldo "Raine"?) and the presence of wooden Eli Roth, but not the ending which I strongly disagree with. See what happens to the best (and obviously cleverest) character in the film, and you know what I mean. But after all, this is a Brad Pitt film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I give QT's Latest "Masterpiece" if you can call it that, 3-4 stars. the movie of course is fiction,the end is good. but the movie to get there is all over the place. songs don't match the era even if it is FICTION! too long,no main character like in Quentin's Other movies. I am not by any means a QT fan. but I thought there wasn't that much gore, The Movie is A fun "What If" Scenario.It's worth renting to see for yourself. Although Valkyrie is a better movie.

When I saw it on theaters, I absolutely loved the movie. It is so well acted, well written and really really funny. I also liked the way all this people talks in different languages and how this mingles into the story. I didn't mind the violence and I think that adds to the film rich plot. It was dissapointing to see that this excellent film just won one oscar when it deserved best picture, director and screenplay. Of course Cristoph Waltz was brilliant as Hans Landa and he deserved every award that won. Inglourious Basterds is now one of my favorite films and definetely the best of 2009 (alonside with Up).<br /><br />This two-disc special edition DVD does not dissapoint at all. Aside from the picture you got plenty of good extras that adds to the film value. I totally recommend this film and this DVD (except if you own a blu-ray) is the best way to see it.<br /><br />Now I'm gonna see Pulp Fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>1944 Nazi-Ocupied France, it seems Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) with his troops are taking over the country and killing off Jews. American soldier Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) with a group of  Jewish-American Soldiers (Eli Roth, Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger, B.J. Novak, Omar Doom, Michael Bacall, Paul Rust, Samm Levine) who call themselves the Basterds as they spread terror and fear to every Nazi in europe. They run across with a beautiful French-Jewish woman named Shoshana (Meline Laurent) who's family was brutally killed by the Nazis as she runs a local movie theater in Paris to get revenge.<br /><br />Featuring appearences by Mike Myers, Julie Dreyfuss, Rod Taylor, Diane Kruger and Bo Stevenson this is one hell of a Quentin Tarantino action-war thriller. Some people love this movie or hate it but i loves it since Quentin never fails me! i believe this is a unique and ultraviolent character study that breaks up in 5 parts like Pulp Fiction back in 1994 did with 3 parts in one movie. I love how this mixes history and fiction combined as the director knows how to do it right and i know the film is a bit slow paced for some but this was a delight to watch. It has a mix of art-house and mainstream all combined in one, if you like a good quality action-drama-character flick then i suggest checking this movie out.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds terrific in High-Def even with that theater quality on the sound with the parts during the war sequences. The Extras are terrific such as trailers, interviews, featurettes, poster gallery, camera angel feature, and extended & alternate scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I have been a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino since "Reservoir Dogs".  That said I was heartily disappointed with his previous grindhouse experiment.  I saw this effort in the cinema and though I liked it I wasn't overly enthusiastic.  My excuse was that I found the constant switch from English to foreign language with subtitles jarring.  Some films, however, deserve a second viewing.  Not since "L.A. Confidential" and "The Sixth Sense" over ten years ago have I reversed my initial opinion of a film.  What I think these film's share are deeply layered scripts that contain alot of subtleties that if you're not alert you miss things.  This is a very ambitious effort by Tarantino.  I won't say he has matured as a filmmaker because he's always been one of our more talented auteurs but this is a progression.  In a nutshell I would describe it as a war film that seems to be a homage to Sergio Leone informed by a film geek's sensibility.  It's a true original even though Tarantino's influences would be apparent to the most astute viewer.  The film is anchored by two brilliant performances one by Brad Pitt as the commando leader and Christoph Waltz as a Gestapo officer.  If Waltz doesn't take home Oscar gold for his work here something's seriously wrong.  In the past I was hesitant to recommend some of Tarantino's work, usually for his penchant for extreme violence and language, and even though this film is harsh at times I wouldn't have as an extreme reservation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>Screenwriter-director Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) is a somewhat disturbing person, as are his films, which tend toward what I would call "black drama" - in the same way that the films of the Coen brothers tend toward black comedy. But Tarantino's films are incredibly interesting both visually and for their stories, which, like the Coens' films, are filled with some very interesting characters. In this case, the Inglourious Basterds is a group of fictional American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), that is terrorizing the Nazis in France during WWII by brutally killing and scalping them Indian style. (This is not a film for weak stomachs.) If the group does let one go, they carve a swastika in his forehead so everyone will know, after the war, what he was.<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds is so well done, and so interesting, that I think it's permissible to overlook Tarantino's excesses for the moment in order to appreciate his craftsmanship. Young directors could learn much from him about how to create riveting scenes, characters and even set pieces. Tarantino likes to create vignettes, which means that each scene can stand on its own, even though, together, they tell a compelling story. His vision seems to come from comic books and graphic novels rather than reality. The art direction and photography are so graphic and so saturated with color that they add to the intensity of the action.<br /><br />Some of the more vulnerable characters are memorable - like Perrier LaPadite, a French dairy farmer, played by Denis Menochet, who pretty much steals one of the early scenes with his understated but poignant performance. The German Colonel Hans Landa - known as "the Hunter" because of his ability to track down Jews, and portrayed superbly by Christoph Waltz - fenagles LaPadite into disclosing that a family of Jews is hiding beneath his house. Or Shosanna, the only member of that family that escapes annihilation by Waltz's men. She flees to Paris and becomes the owner of a cinema that figures prominently in the story. She is played wonderfully by Melanie Laurent.<br /><br />Daniel Bruhl is effective as Fredrick Zoller, a German officer that becomes infatuated with Shosanna. Besides Colonel Hans Landa, most of the Nazis are little more than caricatures, except for Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress-turned-spy, played by Diane Kruger, who dominates the best scene in the film - a meeting in a rathskeller that turns into a Mexican standoff and will have you on the edge of your seat. As a matter of fact, most of the movie will. Except for the overly graphic violence and the brutality of certain scenes, Inglourious Basterds is a glorious suspense thriller that even Alfred Hitchcock would admire. Rated R for strong graphic violence, language and brief sexuality.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Seven months ago, upon my first viewing of the trailer for Quentin Tarantino's highly anticipated WWII film, "Inglourious Basterds," a small coat of goosebumps covers my arms and neck. The words flash across the screen: "You haven't seen war ... until you've seen it through the eyes ... of Quentin Tarantino." And after viewing Basterds, never have any truer taglines been used for a movie's publicity. To say that Tarantino has his own style of filmmaking is one of the most obvious understatements to even a novice filmgoer.<br /><br />Tarantino's magnus opus (to this day), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7Q2WM">Kill Bill - Vol. 1 & 2 (2 Pack)</a>, is the greatest testament to his style, blending spaghetti western, Shaw Bros. Kung Fu films, 1970's revenge pics, grindhouse B-movie and Japanimation. It's the quintessential Quentin film, showcasing his cinephile hodge-podge style that has driven most viewers to the love-him-or-hate-him mantle that has recently emblazoned into audience and critics' minds alike. No matter how violent, profane, or sometimes cartoonish Tarantino's characters may seem, you still have to admit that he creates some damn cool characters with dialogue that only he could conjure, and puts them in run-of-the-mill plots that shift with breakneck speed into SNAFU situations. Now, he's taken his unique style to early 1940's Nazi-occupied France. But first, a brief interlude.<br /><br />Growing up, I was never a big fan of war movies. Upon the first reading of this, my wife's jaw will most likely drop of shock and awe as she knows of my strange draw to the dark war and crime thriller genres that I often watch. But I promise you - and her - it's true. Don't get me wrong, I watched war films, but I was never drawn to watch them. I just watched them to watch them. During my pre-adolescent years, I vaguely remember brief glimpses of John Wayne and Gary Cooper war films that inundated my uncle's TV when I would sleep over my cousins' house. My dad - himself a fan of films - while he loves a good action movie, he never can bring himself to sit down and watch a war movie. He doesn't mind movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W8OM5Y">Braveheart (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELL1S0">The Patriot (Extended Cut)</a>, or "300," but after serving in Vietnam, a Navy photographer surveying the madness of war from a helicopter as bullets whizzed past him (similar to Joe Galloway from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068TPN">We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)</a>), any movies depicting battles from WWII to the present, he won't even attempt to view. I watched classics such as "Johnny Got His Gun," "Full Metal Jacket," "Platoon," "Tora Tora Tora," "Born on the Fourth of July," and now-personal favorites "1941," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HWZ4CA">Sergeant York (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, "The Longest Day," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTURQ">The Dirty Dozen (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, "Glory," and "Memphis Belle" (I watched them just to watch them), but it truly wasn't until Steven Spielberg's 1998 masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBLVI">Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> that I purposely watched war movies. Of course, some aren't as reflective and poignant as Spielberg's. But there have been excellent films of this genre to follow in its footsteps and have filled my DVD collection: "Black Hawk Down," "We Were Soldiers," and the HBO miniseries <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXSS">Band of Brothers</a>.<br /><br />Now, "Basterds" has joined the ranks of these great war films. Yes, it has Tarantino's quirky trademark stamp, but it's also one of the most serious, and, at times, non-Tarantino, films he's created. Sure, there's the occasional interludes of Samuel L. Jackson narration, the Ennio Morricone-riddled score, a brief comic book-style character profile and the fantastic opening sequence between SS Colonel Hans Landa (the superb Christoph Waltz) and a French Jewish sympathizer that is somewhat reminiscent of the famous Dennis Hopper-Christopher Walken scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FDCF">True Romance - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> (just one of my favorite cinema scenes ever). Nonetheless, this film also has a majority of subtitles, a mostly foreign, unknown-in-America cast, and probably is the least violent, more talkative films Tarantino's ever done.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't first mention the most stand-out element: Christoph Waltz. He was awarded the Best Actor Award at Cannes, and Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes and SAG, and, after viewing the film, it's easy to see why. Waltz can transition from laid-back ease one moment to child-like zaniness to nail-biting, cold ruthlessness all in one brilliant quick natural stroke. Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a southern hillbilly who gloriously terrorizes any Nazis who cross his path, leads the Special Ops team known fearfully to the Germans as the Basterds. They - including a brawny director Eli Roth as the "Bear Jew," Donny Donowitz, who beats Nazis to death with a baseball bat inscribed with the names of Jews who his neighbors worry about back in the U.S. (a fact only known by reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316070351">screenplay</a> since the scene was cut from the film) - tear a bloody path across France, littering it with dead, scalped Nazi soldiers in their wake. And while the movie's title refers to this small band of bastards, don't expect Pitt and his crew to headline and have dominated screen time. The central characters to this film are Hans Landa and the Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent - think of a French Sarah Polley). Although Shosanna has made a life for herself managing a small cinema, her wish to avenge her family's death comes into fruition when she catches the eye of the Nazi's "Sergeant York," Private Zoller (Daniel Bruhl).<br /><br />Apart from Pitt and a few of the Basterds, each of the cast is rather unknown in America since Tarantino wanted to use real German and French actors to play their counterparts (fun little fact: Leonardo DiCaprio was considered for Hans Landa, but Tarantino wanted a German actor to play the part). The acting is solid on all counts. Pitt delivers a small but important role similar to his Mickey O'Neil in Snatch. Roth, Diane Kruger, and Michael Fassbender give good, quirky performances, but the best performances go to Laurent and Waltz. They perfectly capture the seriousness and the sometimes-zaniness of the plot without seeming hokey.<br /><br />While Inglourious Basterds certainly had room for improvement, it marked far better than certain other action flicks this summer (uh-hum, *G.I. Joe*). I did wish that some of the "basterds" backgrounds were slightly more explored as well as what became of their fates (it's probably just an assumption to the audience that they were K.I.A. during their mission). However, with a rewrite of history, quick, outrageous bursts of violence, a majority of subtitles and a cast of serious, A-list actors (most of them foreign), Tarantino nearly perfectly balances the line between cheesy B-movie action flick and serious epic WWII film, placing it in the same class as one of my favorites: "The Dirty Dozen." This one stands in file behind "(500) Days of Summer," "Up," and "Away We Go" as my best of the summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I walked out of the theatre after about an hour of this film by Quentin Tarentino because after seeing such WWII films like "Defiance" and "Valkyrie", it lacked authencity.  It seems that Tarentino basically gathered every cliche that he has seen in much better films like "The Dirty Dozen", "Underground" (an obscure film with Cornel Wilde), etc.--and thrown in a blender and out comes this monstrosity.  I even gave the film a second try on Blu-ray and still despite the favorable reviews, changed my opinion of this film.  The film lacks suspense and Tarentino over does it in the dialogue department--allowing a scene to go on much longer than it needs to be. Christoph Waltz's performance as the evil Nazi is perhaps the only saving grace in this disappointing film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>It'll take something fiendishly brilliant to supplant PULP FICTION and KILL BILL as the top two in Tarantino's oeuvre, and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS - an alternate-reality World War II fable - almost done it. Don't fall for that bit of misdirection in which the film is promoted as a Brad Pitt starrer. Brad Pitt isn't the lead as much as a key cog in a rather remarkable ensemble cast. Yes, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is partly about a gritty commando unit called the "Basterds," comprised of Jewish-American soldiers and led by Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine. On the surface, one questions whether the square-jawed American government would actually deploy such a mean and nasty terror team behind enemy lines to inflict brutal just desserts on them swastika-bearers, but we're all worldly folks here. Pitt plays his character as an unabashed caricature, and, in a weird way, he provides the brunt of the film's comedy. I say "in a weird way" because Lt. Aldo Raine happens to be a no-nonsense Southern-drawled gent who never backs down from his unsavory mission, nor does he shy away from inflicting torture on the Nazis. But he's got a way about him. There's an irrepressible glint in his eye when he remarks: "We're in the Nazi killing business ... and let me tell you cousin, business is a-booming." Brad Pitt is having fun spreading inhumane terror.<br /><br />But it's not all about the Basterds and their ruination of the German soldiers' beauty sleep. The Basterds get more screen time than the Howling Commandos in CAPTAIN AMERICA, but it's not by much. Tarantino has always had this knack of picking out actors who end up being perfect for their roles. And sometimes it means going out and finding a French actress to play a French character or a German actor (or, in this case, Austrian) to play the Nazi big bad. Christoph Waltz could not better be as Colonel Hans Landa, the slimy but fiendishly clever "Jew Hunter." Waltz turns in one of the year's most memorable performances, and it's even more impressive once you realize that he does this while speaking in three - almost four - languages. There's a sustained element of danger about him. Waltz imbues Landa with such serpentine intellect. The Colonel seems even more deadly when he's engaging in small talk with the other characters. You're rendered all nervous, wondering just what he's figured out and when he'll spring his trap on them unsuspecting targets.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place in Nazi-occupied France. The film is segmented into chapters, several of which feature the hard-bitten young Jewess Shoshanna Dreyfus who three years ago was Emanuelle Mimuex, a fugitive who witnessed the slaughter of her family. Nowadays Shoshanna is minding her business which happens to be running her own movie theater. But when her cinema becomes the site of a propaganda German film - an event to which the most highly ranked German officers are invited (even a certain failed artist) - Shoshanna sees a chance for get-back. I'd never seen French actress M&eacute;lanie Laurent in anything before, so I don't know if she's this routinely captivating. But her arc is the most heartbreaking. One of my favorite bits in the movie features Laurent in a showstopping sequence serenaded by David Bowie's "Cat People (Putting out Fire)." Others may say the inclusion of a Bowie song is jarring. I say it's friggin' brilliant.<br /><br />All the plot threads converge at Shoshanna's modest little theater, but not before Tarantino gets to play a little bit. He peppers his picture with compelling vignettes, treats us to colorful side characters. Michael Fassbender is very good as a British officer who goes undercover in France. Fassbender exhibits a cool steeliness which may have in part won him the part of Magneto in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. Diane Kruger gets maybe her meatiest role as German actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark. Til Schweiger and Eli Roth make their mark as, respectively, the Basterds' sadistic German recruit, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, and the baseball bat wielding Sgt. Donny Donowitz a.k.a. "the Bear Jew." For trivia buffs, Eli Roth directed HOSTEL and also the film within this film, NATION`S PRIDE, the German film which has its special screening at Shoshanna's theater. You can see this short film in its entirety in the DVD's bonus features.<br /><br />Tarantino's trademark cinematic flourishes are still present, although they may be a trifle subdued. His flair for dialogue isn't as in your face, mostly because sub-titles grace huge chunks of the film. But there's still a sense of suspense and the unexpected in the conversations. Anytime that Christoph Waltz chats up a potential suspect, or that tension-fraught sequence in the bar downstairs, the dialogue plays out like a high stakes chess match. I will say that I think this is the most disciplined that I've seen Tarantino in a while. Or maybe DEATH PROOF and its talky excesses lingers that strongly in the brain. That's not to say that INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS isn't talky, because it is. But Tarantino stays on point with the words. The script stays relevant to the plot. And while the action isn't at all as constant as that in KILL BILL, the violence when it arrives is chilling stuff. Lt. Aldo Raine's mandate is one hundred Nazi scalps from each of his men. They gleefully set about filling their quota. And if you're looking for a virtuous protagonist to pin your allegiance to, well, keep looking, brother. Tarantino delivers a strange, pulpy, morally-askewed war drama. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS may come off like an arthouse film, but it's not for sissies.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's creates an artistic master work on a common canvas with "Inglorious Basterds."<br />The plot is pure fantasy, written in two World War II sub-genres.  Like many of Tarantino's works, the film is one seemingly unrelated episode after another in the first half, and you're not surprised when the diverse plotlines finally converge in a blood-spattered finale.  So, if blood spattering is not you're thing you'll want to steer clear.  I personally can't stand films featuring violence for the sake of violence, but Tarantino always takes time to introduce character motivations so that you know why they kill, maim, etc.  I watched this film back to back with the French wolf movie "Brotherhood of the Wolf" and that stylish film became quite dull as characters killed and maimed for no apparent reason.  Tarantino, acknowledged as a master of dialogue, displays a deft and layered wit in his plot as well.  In many ways I was reminded of his circular masterpiece "Pulp Fiction" with its cast of over-the-top characters weaving in and out of each other's lives.<br /><br />Also like "Pulp Fiction", Basterds is told in Chapters (complete with screen markers and Chapter Titles).  In the opening Chapter Pierre LaPadite, a farmer in Nazi-Occupied France, is chopping wood when his daughters spy a caravan of Nazi vehicles headed toward them.  Monsieur LaPadite orders his daughters into the house as Col Hans Landa approaches.  Tarantino expertly builds tension: Col Landa (played by Christoph Waltz in an Oscar-winning role) is famed as "The Jew Hunter" and after LaPadite invites the Colonel inside the audience is shown that the Dreyfus family is hiding under the floorboards.<br /><br />In the second chapter we meet Brad Pitt as Lt Aldo Raine - a backwoods officer from Tennessee who has orders to assemble a crack team of Jewish soldiers eager to drop behind enemy lines and scalp Nazis.  This team form the title characters.<br /><br />Daniel Bruhl plays Pvt Fredrick Zoller - the "German Sgt York" who earned glory killing scores of enemies of the Reich from a bell-tower.  Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels has made "Pride of Nation" based on Zoller's heroic exploits, and the film careens toward a climax at the Paris premiere of "Pride of Nation", with Hitler, Goebbels and the rest of Germany's high council.  Pitt and the rest of his team have plans to interfere with that premiere, held at a cinema owned by Melanie Laurent, a French Jew who survived the murder of her family by Landa's soldiers four years earlier.<br /><br />This film oozes with QT's cinematic virtuosity.  He finds ways to quote not only American film-making icons like David O. Selznick, but also famed German film propagandists Riefenstahl and G.W. Pabst.  Tarantino veterans Samuel Jackson and Harvey Keitel appear only as voices: Jackson as narrator and Keitel as an American General speaking on the radio in a key late scene.  QT's beloved "Mexican Standoff" appears again in a set piece scene that begins in a French basement bar with drunken celebrating German soldiers playing a "who am I?" guessing game with famed German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (played by Diane Kruger), who is acting as a double-spy who hopes to spirit the "Basterds" into the premiere of "Pride of Nation." Tarantino continues his foot fetish and affinity for nicknames: "The Jew Hunter", "Aldo the Apache."  "The Jew Bear", one of Pitt's squad, is played by "Hostel" director Eli Roth: his Donny Donowitz is feared as a Golem from Hitler to the lowliest footsoldier - although the team is known for literally scalping their victims, the Bear is known for beating their skulls with a baseball bat. (Hey, I didn't say it was pretty...)  Til Schweiger, Germany's biggest movie star, takes a supporting role here as Sgt Hugo Stiglitz, a ferocious German soldier who joins Pitt's team after rescue from a military prison.<br /><br />It perhaps seems that I have given much away - but the joy of this film is seeing how the pieces fit together.  Tarantino makes certain that the pieces fit in a bloody, entertaining way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Inglourious Basterds' is a typical Tarantino film and if you are a fan of his films then this will right up your street. This is set in WW2 and follows a group of American commandos who are behind enemy lines and who terrorize nazi soldiers to lower morale. It also features a Jewish cinema owner who plans to enact her own form of revenge; both stories weave their way separately through the film and join up at the end. This is shot in a series of vignettes (very much in the pulp fiction style) and each little episode provides an extra element to the overall story. Some of the dialogue and behaviour of the Basterds will make you laugh, that is until the retribution begins and then you get the usual Tarantino ultra violence that will make you wince as you watch. The Basterds behaviour is as deplorable as the nazis at times, but their delivery and flair raise a wry smile throughout. There is an excellent cast, with many decent actors playing small roles as well as main characters and whilst the direction is stylised it is easily as good as previous films by Tarantino. The ending is ludicrous but is shot with tongue firmly in cheek and although complete fantasy, it is the ending you would want to make this a satisfying film experience. It's not real, but it is good cinema. This was better than I expected and is worth a watch at some point, just note that it is an 18 certificate for a reason.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is brilliantly scripted, has two of the best acting jobs all year, and is purely Tarantino. If you've seen any of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BR5F4C">Kill Bill</a> series or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R7HY0K">The Grindhouse</a> films, you'll know to expect a bit of blood and brutality. This is, however, Tarantino's first dip into alternate history, and he does a great job at it. However I do think he toned down the bloodshed a tad. Perhaps he's becoming more aware of it, or perhaps he just didn't feel the film warranted it. Whatever the reason, it balanced out nicely ...compared to his other films which tended to go overboard on the crimson.<br /><br />The alternate history involves three unique perspectives: Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) aka The Jew Hunter. Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JIE7JM">Burn After Reading</a>). And Shosanna (Melanie Laurent). All three of these perspectives are taken to extremes (no surprise, again, considering we're talking about a Tarantino movie) during WW II in which we see a persecuted Jew get her just dessert by killing Hitler in her own version of "The Final Solution." We get to see Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) gather a group of ruthless "Gnat-see" killers and carve swastikas into their foreheads. And finally we get the cream of the crop, Jew Hunter Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz) who's ability to sniff out hiding Jews have given him his title.<br /><br />Without Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt in their respective roles, I feel this film wouldn't have been a fraction as good as it was; probably a testament to the casting heads. But specifically to Waltz as Landa, who played the slimy Nazi brutalist only interested in saving his own skin by the end of the war. I think he deserved top billing, not Pitt (although Pitt did his usual extraordinarily great job). Waltz was so key to the entire film that he really held the reins of the story throughout its length. And his range of emotions, from anger to giddiness, was astoundingly disturbing. I loved every second he was on-screen. The fact that the Hollywood Foreign Press gave him a Golden Globe for his supporting role was most appropriate (and I noticed he's garnered praise from many other award ceremonies and, I'm hoping, the Academy Award roster will list him this year).<br /><br />Brad Pitt as the countryfied, American Nazi-hunter was great. But most of his notable lines are delivered whenever he's on-screen with Waltz. The ending sequence in the woods with Lt. Raines' knife and Col. Landa's ...umm ...life, are wonderfully vicious.<br /><br />Of course, we cannot leave out French actress Melanie Laurent as the persecuted Shosanna who is forced to watch her family slaughtered by Landa then flee to Paris and blend in with society. Only later does she learn that her new life and career sets her up perfectly to exact revenge on the Nazi party ...and its top leaders; the very top, in fact. She also is forced to fight off the advances of a German soldier whom she finds both endearing and loathsome.<br /><br />By the end of Inglorious Basterds, you feel like you've been on a wild ride at a theme park, until you realize you've never left your seat. It's a remarkable film that is cast exceptionally well. This one's worth owning for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>Maybe I haven't watched enuff films to be able to figure out why this POS would be developed and actually delivered to the screen...I dunno, Diane was a phenom as Walz,but WHY???  Did the train roll off the trax in the EPs ofc and no one could say NO due to the Jew Killing Revenge scene???  Hitler didn't even look like he suffered as much as Walz did with the slice n dice screaming drawn (haha) out scene...The mess of dialogue and subtitles just made me insane and the plodding pace amazed me at my prowess of patience to finally see the damn cinema burn...BORING!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I tried hard to like this, but in the end, this movie was just as bad and boring as Tarantino's crap-fest, Death Proof! There were a few funny parts and a couple of action scenes, but the rest was just dull conversations in another language. You practically read the whole movie. There was 95% talking, and 5% action! The film is told in 5 chapters, and the only two chapters I kinda liked were Chapter Two & Five. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine who is the leader of a group called The Basterds. They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest. A few weeks ago, I rented the original Inglorious Bastards movie to get ready for this one, but that was a waste of time, because this has nothing to do with the 1970's version. I definitely would not recommend INGLORIOUS BASTERDS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>The trailer says it all; and yet, watching it in full doesn't provide too much more, except for the occasional weird (and, in once instance, very touching) plot twists. A film of long dialogue-intensive scenes (very long - the opener, especially, lasts forever, as does the long "basement bar" scene), it really could have done with some trimming. But... apparently, there were deleted scenes and new characters aplenty, including one created for Maggie Cheung!  (Huh?! How could you get Maggie Cheung to be in your film and then not use the footage?!?)<br /><br />Nice use of German and French and Italian, which is welcome for people who are not monolingual, but the film lacks a main character. Who is the film's protagonist? It's not Brad Pitt, nor any of the people on the movie poster. If anything, it's Shosanna Dreyfus, who is central to the opening scene as well as the main plot, but she doesn't have much screen time. Sure, the Basterds are busy striking fear in the Nazi's heart, but do we really care?<br /><br />What is interesting about the film itself is how two circumstantial plots come together to ensure the outcome, which I don't think I've seen in a film before. The other thing that is interesting is that the film appears to be leading to a sequel; I would think that part two could be more interesting than part one. Altogether it's a bit of a rarity - a film with a good plot/ending that doesn't do a great job establishing (most of) the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>mediocer! Congratulations: the first time we've had to see him when he actually keeps his clothes on during the entire movie. This story is interesting, but totally ficticious and it really should have been called: "Vainglorious Basterds." It didn't even have any HD stuners or relief for one second of what has got to be one of the most hilarious imterpretations of Hitler in history.<br />Hey Guys, if you are going to make a somewhat historical movie, try not to make it a goofy farce!</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>What a boring frickin movie. I wish I never bought it. Blu-Ray quality is excellent but the movie itself sucks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>This is a great Tarantino film, but kids, don't watch this for the history. It's no history flick, but an entirely re-imagined take on WW2, with a completely different ending. Divided into five chapters, each one is filled with tension that finally explodes so fast you barely have time to decipher it. This, of course, will remind people of the "Kill Bill" films. So be it. There 's a lot of unsavory violence as we watch Nazis being pulped with a baseball bat, and bodies being riddled with bullets. Brad Pitt is far from the lone star here, though his role is less central than credits make it appear. A fantasy movie. Great watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>I don't think this can be properly appreciated without knowing how it ends. Personally, I left the theater disappointed after my first viewing - like I'd been the butt of an enormous joke, with QuentinTarantino taking full advantage of the kind of notoriety and clout he'd accumulated over the years to cash in on an intentional stink bomb. Now, a few years removed from the experience, I've given it another shot and left with an entirely different look on my face. It's a magnificent film, dedicated to building up one impossible situation after the next; two full hours dedicated to stacking the dynamite. The implication, of course, is that he'll find a way to write himself out of it - and I suppose he does, just not in a way that anyone could have expected. It's an impervious blend of Tarantino's notoriously sharp-witted dialog, his ADD-influenced lack of focus on any particular storyline for more than twenty minutes, and a deep yearning to lead his audience into a false sense of security before dumping cold water over their heads. Brad Pitt has the time of his life as the braggish, stereotypical war movie lead with an awful accent, but Christoph Waltz steals the show as a giddy turncoat Nazi sleuth. Basterds is a stroke of brilliance, weaving three distinctly different movies into one spectacular cinematic quilt. Where my initial impressions of the "did they just do that" climax were of shock and disdain, time and honest thought have transformed it into one of my favorite scenes. Ballsy, bright and bombastic, it deserves a spot alongside the director's classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Based on the trailers for Inglorious Basterds, if you go into this movie expecting a Nazi slaughterfest with scene after scene of Nazi beatings and executions, you might walk away from the movie feeling grossly misled. Because Inglorious Basterds is way more than a slaughterfest. Don't get me wrong...oh, it has it's moments of slaughter, but what makes Inglorious Basterds such a great movie is the sophisticated stories and plotlines leading up to the more violent parts of the movie.<br /><br />First, a word on Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino's casting: superb! Look, I've heard the criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Inglorious Basterds. The guy can act. The way Pitt scrunches up his face in an annoyed look throughout the entire film and combines it with a no mercy attitude is believable and effective...it works. Really works. And the rest of the cast?...Amazing. Tarantino uses French actors to play the French and German Actors to play the Germans, and this just added an element of reality to a story that (unfortunately) was fictitious.<br /><br />And the guy who plays the head of Hitler's security deserves Hollywood's highest kudos at all of their self indulgent award shows. German Actor Christoph Waltz plays the evil, intelligent and diabolical Colonel Hans Landa, and when he walks into a scene you shudder. You will not soon forget Waltz's performance.<br /><br />Tarantino masterfully gets A+ performances out of his cast to tell the story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's top leadership. The movie is devoted more to the development of these plotlines than it is to showing the development of the infamous reputation for murdering Nazi soldiers that Pitt and his band of brothers have. So as I said earlier, walk into Inglorious Basterds with your expectation set for a well-directed, intricate, often deep, storyline with some pretty violent moments and your expectations will be met.<br /><br />The climactic ending was a bit unbelievable. But overall, Inglorious Basterds is a great movie. Don't miss it.</p></br></body></html>

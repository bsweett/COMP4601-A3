Her busy parents don't have much time for her, though, and her new, remote home doesn't offer much reward for her explorations (other than some rather kooky neighbors). So, even if it's not wholly conscious, Coraline wishes for a nicer place and parents that pay more attention.<br /><br />As the movie's tagline says, "be careful what you wish for." Like Alice down the rabbit hole, Coraline finds a secret passage to a more magical place. Soon, however, the magic turns dark. That's where the brilliant animation really comes into its own. The stop animation (or at least the look of it) bring to mind Tim Burton with a macabre touch of Brothers Quay. You know your child best - skittish ones might find some of the imagery a bit much. Still, kids' stories (like Alice in Wonderland) have always had dark edges. That deliciously spooky sense, plus some great animation, really set this movie apart from the usual.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>If any proof were needed that 3-D movies have entered a bold new era, Coraline is it; this stylistically bold, emotionally resonant stop-motion flick is a twisted marvel. Directed by Henry Selick and based upon the best seller by Neil Gaiman, Coraline follows the phantasmagoric exploits of the title character, a bored 11-year-old who discovers a door in her house that leads to a parallel version of her life -- one that at first is enchanting, but soon threatens to entrap our hero. Coraline is one of the most visually dazzling pictures to come along in many a moon, and it's anchored by a delightfully twisted storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>My first grader has inherited my affinity for scary flicks, though of course all that she's been exposed to is the kid-friendly variety. Coraline is the darkest of all the "scary" flicks we've watched this October, but we watched it together, discussed various aspects whenever she had a question, and surprisingly she did not find it scary though she did comment on some parts being creepy. I think for her age, she probably did not quite grasp some of the darker aspects of the movie, but she did get the gist of the movie, and the message behind it.<br /><br />Coraline's story bears the message "the grass is not always greener on the other side." Coraline complains about her life with her parents, at not being able to do what she wants, when she wants, blah blah blah. Until one day, she discovers a door or portal into another world, where everything seems so much better, just like her present life, only more interesting and appealing. Of course there's a catch, and the seemingly "benign" mother figure in this other world soon turns out to be vile and wicked with an evil agenda - to keep Coraline trapped with her forever, as with all the other lost children. Coraline discovers that not only does she have to escape this evil entity's clutches, but also save her parents who have become trapped in another world, and free the souls of the captive children.<br /><br />The animation is unique and interesting and fascinated both my daughter and myself. I certainly think this is a movie that is more appropriate for older children, ages 8 and up, but with parental supervision and guidance, it can be appreciated by a younger child. It certainly brought up some interesting issues for discussion between my daughter and I. Intelligent, well-scripted (and based on Neil Gaiman's novel), this is a movie I'm adding to our DVD library. Now if only Gaiman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WUC5R2">The Graveyard Book (Hardcover)</a> would be brought to screen!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>After very disappointing "Monkeybone," Henry Selick, director of "The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)" and "James and the Giant Peach (1996)", has returned with "Coraline," a delightful stop-motion animated fantasy tale - a bit dark one as based on a Neil Gaiman book. This is a modern-day adventure of Alice-like spirited heroine encountering these eccentric characters in another universe, some of which could be as terrifying as the head-chopping Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Coraline Jones (voice by Dakota Fanning) has recently moved in the 150-year-old Pink Palace Apartments. The 11-year-old girl has no friends to talk to, except a slightly nervous boy "Wybie" (Robert Bailey, Jr.). And Coraline's parents Charlie (voice by John Hodgman) and Mel (voice by Teri Hatcher) are too busy.<br /><br />But Coraline, an independent, intelligent and curious girl, finds a strange door while exploring the old house. She then discovers a big secret about it. Through the door, only at night, she can go to the "other" world, where she meets the "Other Mother" and the "Other Father." The other parents are caring and loving - and the Other Father, always delightful, is an incredibly gifted pianist!<br /><br />It is only natural that Coraline starts visiting the other world frequently. But there is another big secret about the wonderful world and its inhabitants Coraline has not known yet.<br /><br />The storyline itself may not b exactly original and Coraline's adventure (or "game") is not really an adventure to some, but like many classic fairy tales "Coraline" is most intriguing and disturbing when it suggests the fate of those who have made a wrong decision. With colorful and imaginative (and sometimes even creepy) visuals, strong voice acting from Dakota Fanning giving life to the heroine, "Coraline" is an engaging fantasy with some dark edges.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>Question: What would you get if Alice Liddell married Jack Skellington?<br /><br />Answer: CORALINE<br /><br />The animated film, CORALINE is a deliciously eerie movie adaptation of the novel by Neil Gaiman.  This dark odyssey starts with a young girl's boredom and ends with her being appreciative of her own backyard. Both figuratively and literally. It is a well-told tale reminiscent of Through the Looking Glass, The Wizard of Oz, and Hansel and Gretel. What I particularly liked about the tale was that CORALINE's parents are alive and remain so from beginning to end. Yeah for living parents!<br /><br />When first we see CORALINE (not Caroline, as she has to remind folks quite often) (voiced by Dakota Fanning), she is bored. She lives in an apartment with her mother and father, both of whom work from home but can't give her the attention she craves. She tries visiting the old Vaudevillian ladies who live upstairs as well as the crazy old man who trains the mice, but she just doesn't understand them. Huh. Then she finds the key and the door, and the passage beyond that's sometimes there and sometimes not. The old man says that the mice have a message for her: don't enter the passage. If only CORALINE had listened.<br /><br />What CORALINE finds beyond that passageway is what makes this story interesting. It's what makes all classic fairytales interesting. Temptation, morality, determination, and heroism, all wrapped up like a spooky burrito with a side order of eerie dipping sauce.<br /><br />CORALINE is a dark movie, full of black magic and creepy critters.  Brilliantly directed by Henry Selick (who brought us THE CORPSE BRIDE, JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) and Michael Cachuela, CORALINE is fast paced and contains just the right amount of spookiness.  My 12 year old LOVED this film, and my 4 year old liked it, too.  She did not have any bad dreams, and she completely understood that it was not real.  The animation is unique and very moody - perfect for this film.  The voice talent is all outstanding, but truly you are more interested in this weird and wonderful story than you are the voices.<br /><br />CORALINE is a MUST SEE movie for 2009 and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by my entire family.  We had a great time watching it together.  CORALINE might not be typical family movie night fare, but it worked for us.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of "Coraline," brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous "other" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed "other mother" (Teri Hatcher) and matching "other father," (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book "Coraline" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James and the Giant Peach." Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />Apparently the blu-ray (as usual now) will have some material not included on the standard DVDs. There's going to be a trio of featurettes about making and voicing the movie, deleted scenes, a digital copy, and a movie commentary -- and exclusive to the blu-ray is ANOTHER featurette, "picture in picture," BD-live, and something called "My Scenes Sharing."<br /><br />"Coraline" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures. Definitely a must-see, for those who enjoy a movie with some genuine chills.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>This movie was really different.  I mean not normal different but out there creatively just brilliantly different.  The movie is spooky so I wouldn't recommend it for young children.  There was a bit of a draggy feeling at some point, but you shouldn't miss this film because it will blow your mind to see the world they come up with.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Coraline: 7 out of 10: Whom is this movie for is a question that dashed through my mind while watching it. It is too scary and adult for most children. The film is full of High Octane Nightmare Fuel and retired adult entertainment stars with naked elderly puppet breasts... come to think of it that is High Octane Nightmare Fuel as well.<br /><br />As for the adults in the audience, I fear that in my case the film was too distant. I never felt emotionally attached to our plucky protagonist. In part because she is not a very nice girl (nor terribly plucky now I think about it) and partially because the film seemed to place her and her predicament at a distance.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was floored by the sheer artistry of the film. Visually this is simply one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. Director Henry Selick who helmed such stop motion masterpieces as James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas has taken his art to a new level. Words simply cannot describe the visual delights that lie inside Coraline.<br /><br />While I found the story somewhat distancing I also recognize the depth of the tale. Coraline's two universes mirror each other in a complicated web rather than a simply black and white as one might expect. The ocean here may not be that wide but it is amazingly deep. To bad the water was a little cold for this swimmer.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for?  Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy.  But as the old adage says, "Be careful what you wish for" - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this "perfect" world and these "perfect" parents may not be quite so perfect after all.<br /><br />Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, "Coraline" is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time.  Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time.  The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to.  As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal.  Like all good fantasies made for kids, "Coraline" finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can`t even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline).<br /><br />But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful "other" world that  Coraline visits - not by a long shot.  For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales.  Thus, since "Coraline" does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences.  Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm.<br /><br />The animation is first-rate on every level.  The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton`s "Nightmare Before Christmas").  Yet, "Coraline" never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of "Coraline," brought to life by the talented Henry Selick.

As Gaiman is well known to pen creepy childrens' stories, this one renders wonderfully as a moving picture.  In a decidedly grim parallel, Coraline goes down her own rabbit hole, to find that predictable, boring life with her parents isn't so bad.  The story is one I definitely will enjoy watching repeatedly.<br /><br />However, the 3D version of this film at home was a lackluster experience.  The perspective was slightly off and only a few fleeting times did it gel correctly to actually convey a 3D effect.  For all its artistic quality the 3D version falls short and could easily detract from the splendor of the story.  Stick to the 2D version.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Coraline, the latest adaptation of a work by Neil Gaiman, has hit theatres. It tells the story of young girl who, along with her rather oblivious parents, has just recently moved to the Pink Palace Apartments in what appears to be Ashland, Oregon. She feels stifled and doesn't like the place, especially after she meets weird local boy Wybie.<br /><br />Her life becomes rather more interesting when she finds a portal to another world (climbing through something rather similar to a big, blue-purple vagina. I'm not judging, just reporting), where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, both idealized versions of her parents with buttons for eyes. They lavish love and attention upon her and don't appear to want anything in return. Well, possibly her eyes.<br /><br />This is a weird little stop-motion animated movie with some of the best, most amazing visuals I've seen on film in a long time. One of the things I love about movies is their abilities to show me things I've never seen and on that level this film doesn't disappoint. The mouse circus alone is worth the price of admission. It's also got a good, if rather basic, plot and some great voice acting.<br /><br />The film has a brisk pace, and at no point was I looking at my watch, wondering when it would end. The sheer creativeness of what I was seeing up on the screen was enough to distract me from the few plot holes, though I did notice a couple points where it seemed like scenes were missing.<br /><br />But there was something kind of off about the film. I don't know what it was. It certainly felt somewhat incomplete, and the third act felt kind of rushed (basically, "Go off on a quest!" followed a few moments later by, "Right, quest done!"). Despite that, it was a decent movie and I didn't feel my money was wasted, which is always a plus.<br /><br />One word of caution about the film. I would be careful on taking young kids to see it. There's some rather dark images here (like a few attempts at removing eyes), that might give kids some rather unhappy dreams. I'd not take anyone under about 8 or so without seeing it first to screen it.<br /><br />Also, I can't speak to the 3-D effects, since my theatre didn't show it in 3-D. I could tell where there were clearly moments that were supposed to be 3-D but weren't. I've a feeling it probably didn't add anything to the movie to see it in 3-D, though.<br /><br />So if you want a good time at a film where you'll see things you've never seen before, go to this. If you don't want that, hey, there's always Benjamin Button. At least you'll keep in the buttons theme.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Coraline (NOT Caroline) Jones (Fanning) is a very unhappy girl.  Both her parents are far too busy to pay much attention to her; she misses her friends back home; and the young boy who lives next door is a real pest.  The only solace she finds in her new apartment is a strange door that appears to be bricked up...until the sun goes down.  For that's when Caroline gets to go visit her Other Mother, a gracious woman who has all the time in the world for her beloved daughter.  There's just one little hitch: Coraline's Other Mother wants her to stay...forever.<br /><br />"Coraline" is from the mind of Neil Gaiman, so you know it's going to be twisted and disturbing.  And it is; this is one of the more frightening family films ever made.  The imagery is surprisingly horrific; perhaps smaller children won't pick up on the subtleties, but their parents certainly will.  The voice cast, featuring supporting roles by Terri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Keith David, and Ian McShane, helps create an atmosphere of spine-tingling suspense.  The real standout, though, is Dakota Fanning.  In previous film roles, she's been precocious and downright annoying; remember "War of the Worlds"?  No?  Well, sorry for reminding you.  But here she's fantastic; she does what many voice-over artists fail to do: lend her animated character real life, real personality.<br /><br />The overall effect of "Coraline" can be a bit numbing (I only gave the film 4 stars because, near the middle, it sags a bit, once the wonder has worn off).  Maybe it's different in 3D; I haven't jumped on that bandwagon yet.  (By the way, the DVD--and presumably Blu-ray--comes with both the 2D and 3D version of the film, so you can experience the movie both ways if you prefer.)  However, this is certainly a film you should watch if love a good old fashion Grimm's fairy tale.  That's what Gaiman and Selick have created: a modern-day fairy tale, complete with horrors and morals and a talking cat.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>I ordered the 2d version based on ratings and I was not disappointed . I got a 2 sided disc with 2d and 3d versions. the 2d was more colorful and sharper. I watched the 3d version for several minutes. I got some of the 3d effect but the color was so dull that it was boring, and The vision was still uncomfortable after 10 minutes. Current 3D is not worth it to me.<br />The movie was great. I liked the story line, the animation, the dialogue, and the voices. Suitable for all ages and interesting for adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>Honestly, whether one hates or loves the film, I do not see how this entire package cannot be rated other than a five star Blu. You have a two disc set that contains a 2D, 3D, DVD copy, Dig Copy, an hour of special features in 1080i, Dbox, and the usual mix of BD Live options from Universal.<br /><br />I watched this with my kids both that are under 10, and contrary to what anyone says as a shock tactic, this movie was not a horror flick. It was a great animation film with a solid story that looked outstanding on Blu. Having both copies readily available, I compared several scenes to prove the vibrancy, colors, and clarity were greatly improved with BD, even with it being this type of animation. The 3D version loses the usual color palette, but looked great compared to other 3D out of late.<br /><br />The DTS was mixed eloquently, and more times than not they managed to use all five channels with much more frequency that can be done with a live action film. So after enjoying a fun film (ignore the naysayers here) we spent an hour going over the supplements.<br /><br />The making-of lasts 36 minutes and contains many smaller features that do have the Play All option. After watching the Voicing Of (10:46), the strangely edited deleted scenes (8:47) and the Creepy Coraline (5:30) segment I almost side with splitting between the features that you find the most interesting. The deleted scenes are bizarre in how they edited in the director's facial contortions and the ten 1-2 seconds blips as "needing to be cut" - whatever. Some great information either way regarding the time it took to make certain sequences. Have not had a chance to utilize the DBOX option or the BD live features for this one. The usual Universe U Control option is available to you if your player is all tuned up for doing the PiP and such.<br /><br />The clarity, colors, sound, supplements, and extra copies all make for a worthwhile product purchase, especially for as low in price as it has gotten in the last week. Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>If you like unique fantasy fairy tale  type movies with a slightly dark egde then you'll probably enjoy this. If you are a parent thinking this is for children, watch it first perhaps then decide wether or not your child should view it since some of the imagery and storyline might seem too horrific/dark. The stop animation really pops in HD. The only thing I didn't care for was the one brief musical type song the "other father" broke into at one point in the movie... it was just a week song, and if you're going to do a musical then you have to fully commit to it, and... Don't hire Danny Horrible Song Writer Elfman to do it as in The Corpse Bride etc. But that's another topic altogether.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Coraline (no, that's NOT a spelling mistake!) may be one of the spookiest animated films I've seen in quite some time.<br /><br />What makes it different from all the rest is the constantly quiet and creepy atmosphere, and the highly unusual flow to all the animated scenes.<br /><br />When this film first began for example, I was completely confused watching an animation showing a doll fly through a window, then get ripped apart and put back together again, then out the window it went.  Just a REALLY strange piece of animation.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />The soundtrack is fascinating.  In fact it might be one of the best soundtracks to an animated film ever.  It's seriously THAT good.  Okay, Dumbo probably wins the award for best ever soundtrack, but Coraline is definitely a runner-up.<br /><br />The music seriously reminds me of the mid 70's Canterbury scene involving progressive rock bands such as Hatfield and the North, Caravan and the Soft Machine.  Plus it's entirely melodic and just perfect.  I absolutely LOVE it.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty good too, though incredibly simple and adventurous.  Just how a storyline *should* be.  A young girl bored out of her mind because her parents are too busy to spend time with her goes on an adventure of a lifetime right in her own home (by going back and forth through a secret doorway in the wall).<br /><br />On the other side of the wall lies mirror images of her parents, but with buttons for eyes!  I kid you not, haha.  It's kind of scary in a way, but not intentionally so.<br /><br />Overall, the atmosphere is definitely eerie, and the quiet tone of the entire movie might take a few minutes to adjust to, but in the end Coraline is a quality film for children and adults alike.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This is a wonderfully original and imaginative stop-motion animated rendering of Neil Gaiman's juvenile book of the same name. Dakota Fanning is the voice of Coraline Jones, an adolescent girl whose parents have dragged her off to an apartment in an isolated hilltop Victorian so they can finish writing a gardening catalog. Though bored out of her mind, she's also adventurous and self-reliant, and it's not long before she discovers the secret door hidden behind the wallpaper in the parlor that gives her access to an alternative world with apparently wonderful alternative parents. Of course (as a story like this requires), not all is as it seems in that distorted world. The other tenants include the retired circus man, Mr. Bobinsky, and the elderly Misses Spink and Forcible (and their wall full of stuffed deceased terriers), and a feral cat with very fixed opinions when it comes to rats, and who attempts to give Coraline good advice which she waits almost too long to listen to. The plot is classic cautionary (and rather dark) fairy tale and the character details and bits of business are classic Gaiman. [I note most of the one-star reviews are actually complaints about the rendering of the 3-D content. Frankly, I didn't even know it *was* 3-D. And I don't especially care.]</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>Great movie.<br />Great story line....targeted to a younger audience but still entertaining<br />Great animation.<br />Great characters.<br /><br />FYI - There is one scene that seems a bit too adult for kids. It is a scene toward the middle of the movie where a woman with very large breasts is barely covered. The scene is about 5 minutes long. It is not overly sexual but, it is kind of strange to have it in a kids movie. So, 4 stars and not 5. I wish I could give it 4 and 3/4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Well, it's happened again: another animated movie that can I describe "the greatest-looking animation I've ever seen!"  This has happened several times now in the past few years, and especially when they're available on a stunning Blu-Ray disc transfer.  (Note: three months after this, "UP" came out on Blu-Ray and surpassed this!! It just keeps getting better....)<br /><br /> I'm talking about the 2-D version, not the 3-D (which is not even in the same ballpark.) Forget the 3-D glasses and watch this as you would any other movi. You'll be extremely impressed at the colors and detail, and maybe just plain blown away by it all.<br /><br />Not only to the colors and detail dazzle, but the inventiveness here is really fun to watch and items change from one form or color to another. In parts, it reminded me of the old Beatles' "Yellow Submarine" with its colorful cleverness.<br /><br />To me, all of this made the story is secondary but that the latter isn't very interesting, too. The story is unique; quite different, with a good message getting everything you want not always being as attractive as that sounds.<br /><br />The minor characters in this story, by the way: such as "Mr. Bobinsky," "Miss Forcible" and "Miss Spink" - are a real hoot. and more fun than the main characters.  And - one last thing - adults mind find this more entertaining than kids.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Coraline, the latest adaptation of a work by Neil Gaiman, has hit theatres. It tells the story of young girl who, along with her rather oblivious parents, has just recently moved to the Pink Palace Apartments in what appears to be Ashland, Oregon. She feels stifled and doesn't like the place, especially after she meets weird local boy Wybie.<br /><br />Her life becomes rather more interesting when she finds a portal to another world (climbing through something rather similar to a big, blue-purple vagina. I'm not judging, just reporting), where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, both idealized versions of her parents with buttons for eyes. They lavish love and attention upon her and don't appear to want anything in return. Well, possibly her eyes.<br /><br />This is a weird little stop-motion animated movie with some of the best, most amazing visuals I've seen on film in a long time. One of the things I love about movies is their abilities to show me things I've never seen and on that level this film doesn't disappoint. The mouse circus alone is worth the price of admission. It's also got a good, if rather basic, plot and some great voice acting.<br /><br />The film has a brisk pace, and at no point was I looking at my watch, wondering when it would end. The sheer creativeness of what I was seeing up on the screen was enough to distract me from the few plot holes, though I did notice a couple points where it seemed like scenes were missing.<br /><br />But there was something kind of off about the film. I don't know what it was. It certainly felt somewhat incomplete, and the third act felt kind of rushed (basically, "Go off on a quest!" followed a few moments later by, "Right, quest done!"). Despite that, it was a decent movie and I didn't feel my money was wasted, which is always a plus.<br /><br />One word of caution about the film. I would be careful on taking young kids to see it. There's some rather dark images here (like a few attempts at removing eyes), that might give kids some rather unhappy dreams. I'd not take anyone under about 8 or so without seeing it first to screen it.<br /><br />Also, I can't speak to the 3-D effects, since my theatre didn't show it in 3-D. I could tell where there were clearly moments that were supposed to be 3-D but weren't. I've a feeling it probably didn't add anything to the movie to see it in 3-D, though.<br /><br />So if you want a good time at a film where you'll see things you've never seen before, go to this. If you don't want that, hey, there's always Benjamin Button. At least you'll keep in the buttons theme.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Henry Selick, best known for "The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) and "James and the Giant Peach" (1996) brings his talent for stop-motion animation to this adaptation of Neil Gaiman's children's novel "Coraline". Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is an 11-year-old girl whose family has just moved into an apartment in a slightly dilapidated Victorian house. While her parents are busy finishing up work on a deadline, and it pours rain outside, Coraline is bored. Then she discovers a small door in the living room that has been papered over. At night the door leads to another house like hers, only better, with more attentive versions of her parents and perfected versions of her eccentric neighbors. Her Other Mother (Terry Hatcher) invites Coraline to stay in the other world, but there is high price to pay, and Coraline begins to suspect something sinister.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation was the choice for this film because it ages well. I couldn't agree more. "Coraline" looks fantastic and distinctive. It leaves a strong visual impression. I was reminded of "The Mascot" (1934), an early example of stop-motion that is as strong today as it was 75 years ago. I have not read the novel "Coraline", but I understand that the film has made significant changes, including that addition of a prologue in which we see mechanical hands creating a doll of Coraline. I'm grateful for that sequence, as it contains some of the film's most memorable animation. Like so many children's stories, there is a lesson imbedded in the tale. The film's tagline is "Be careful what you wish for". In the Other World, everything is exactly how Coraline would like it, for herself and for others. But it makes her value her real family all the more.<br /><br />There has been a lot of discussion about whether "Coraline" is actually a children's film. It is not graphic; there is no blood or guts. There are disturbing ideas which are enhanced by creepy imagery. I would caution that it is probably too scary for children under six. For 6-10-year-olds, it is an entirely individual matter. The book on which it is based is fantasy/horror intended for 9-12-year-olds. Some children like to be scared, and if your 8-year-old is one of those kids, "Coraline" might be just the thing. If your child is sensitive, you may not want to cope with the nightmares. It's a nice film for older children, because it encourages children to be bright and independent and never condescends to them. It doesn't have the thematic sophistication that makes many Pixar films equally suitable for adults. But "Coraline" is visually interesting enough that it won't bore adults either.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc edition): The single disc edition has the 2-D film on one side of the disc and a 3-D version on the other. It comes with 4 pairs of glasses for viewing the 3-D. This isn't the same 3-D as was in movie theaters. That technology is not available for home viewing, so this version is the old blue-red 3-D. There is an audio commentary by director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais on the 2-D side of the disc. This is a constant, information-packed commentary. Selick talks about the changes he made to the book, the look of the real world versus the other world, and a lot of technical information about filming and working with the puppets. Coulais joins the commentary near the end. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>I had no earthly idea what I was in for when I popped "Coraline" in the Blu-Ray player. My wife, my nearly-8-year-old son and I curled up with some popcorn after dinner, and sat back to see what this was all about.<br />From the first eerie, muted scenes, and off-kilter score, you realize you're about to take a trip to somewhere you haven't been before, and it might not be 100% pleasant.<br />I must say my son was hypnotized from the first scene. He even put down his Nintendo DS. I don't think he blinked more than twice during the whole running time.<br />The tale, about Coraline, her odd family and MORE odd "other" family, is a fractured fairy tale to be sure. There's a classicism to the story...it has a little Hansel and Gretel to it...but it's also defiantly modern in the heroine's sensibilities.<br />The plot has been outlined to death by other reviewers.<br />While the movie unspooled, my wife kept looking over to me, the look on her face of "this is kinda creepy" was unmistakable.<br />I asked my son a few times, "Are you OK? Are you scared?", and each time he replied "Yes" with a smile.<br />The animation is living, breathing,  moving art. Dear God you could stare into that (2D for me) picture and find infinite, amazing details within each room, each exterior...the garden...there's one shot that will literally take your breath away. You will actually pause your respiratory effort, so that you can absorb that gorgeous overhead shot of the garden. If you've seen the movie, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't, well, if you remember anything about this review, you'll remember THIS when you see that shot.<br />The voice acting is superb. The expressive puppetry is nothing short of miraculous. The music is intertwined with the images brilliantly.<br />I enjoyed this about as much as my son, and more than my wife, who was still pretty creeped out at the end.<br />The making-of stuff is thorough, but not overwhelming.<br />At less than sixteen bucks, this disc is a bargain and a half.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of "Coraline," brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous "other" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed "other mother" (Teri Hatcher) and matching "other father," (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book "Coraline" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James and the Giant Peach." Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />"Coraline" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures -- definitely for fans of Gaiman, dark fantasy and really creepy stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>This movie has a slow start, but picks up steam once the main character, Coraline, discovers a small portal into another dimension at her new house. That other dimension looks exactly like the world Coraline lives in now, except the people there have buttons for eyes.<br /><br />But an even more important difference about this other dimension is that all the people there cater exclusively to Coraline's ego by making her the center of attention.  This treatment is in stark contrast to her real world where her distracted parents treat her like a pest.  It's no surprise then that Coraline becomes seduced by all this flattery.<br /><br />But like the saying goes, just because the grass looks greener on the other side doesn't mean it really is. Coraline learns the hard way that if someone is pouring on the flattery, they usually have an agenda.  Heck, there are grown adults who still need to learn this lesson.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this movie, but the reason I only gave it 4 stars was because I was confused about which age bracket this is targeted for.  The lessons here would be good for kids to learn, but there are some scenes that are too adult for kids to watch. The first is the opening scene with a doll that's kind of scary.  And the second is the scene where you see a large breasted woman wearing nipple pasties and thong underwear.<br />These two scenes felt out-of-place in an otherwise meaningful and visually delightful movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I guess their holding out until they award it with Animated Movie of the decade. In my humble opinion, this movie was shafted at the Oscars because it wasn't from Disney or Pixar and CORALINE, is a threat to the animated movie market that has been monopolized by Disney/Pixar for...ever. Yet, CORALINE stands by itself as the kind of movie that will change the landscape of animation in the years to come. It doesn't need the publicity to pull this off. It does it with its quality and its magic.<br /><br />Quiet simply, CORALINE is amazing. It may be slightly strange, and it may be slightly dark, but so was MONSTER HOUSE. It is a ghost/witch story for children. It may be slightly scary, but that is part of the fun of it.<br /><br />I first watched it with a group of adult friends, in 3D (FOCUS was nice enough to release the 3D version, regular blu-ray & dvd blu-ray with special features with their first release, not the special secret overpriced edition 6 months later like some companies), and found it mind-blowing.  It was the first time that I had seen a 3D movie, at home, actually work.<br /><br />So, my first inclination was that it was too scary for my 4-year old and probably too scary for my 9-year old. Yet, not soon after, the 9-year old asked for it and there they were, both of them, glued to the television like I had never seen. Most movies hold their attention for a while and they end up drawing or wrestling, yet CORALINE had them staring at the television the whole time, jaws open, floored.  Thirty minutes after it was over, they wanted to watch it again... and again... there they were, awe struck through the entire movie, just like I was.<br /><br />Coraline tells the story of a little girl who is feeling gilted by her parents who are too busy with their lives to pay her attention. So, when she finds a secret door that leads her to an alternate universe, with attentive, loving parents who give her floats for dinner, she is enticed to say goodbye to the real world and join her alternative universe where everyone has buttons for eyes.<br /><br />It's a classic that should be held in the same esteem and long-lasting category as Wizard of Oz and it will, at least in my home, be one of the most loved children movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A26O0T192IBKY1.html">A26O0T192IBKY1</a><br/><p>Yet another movie based on the works of comic god Neil Gaiman(sorry, no Sandman yet), this stop-motion animated film was directed by Henry Selick, whose former works include The Nightmare Before Christmas and James And The Giant Peach. It was one of the few movies that he acted alone from Tim Burton from, but was much more successful than his bomb of Monkeybone. Gaiman's book Coraline was largely inspired by Alice In Wonderland, and I'd have say that this film made for a better fantasy/suspense movie for kids that the recent Tim Burton one.<br /><br />Set in an apartment home in the midwest, Coraline is a bored girl whose family has recently moved into the old estate. After leaving all her friends behind from her former town, she finds her new crib to be slightly off. There's strange neighbors, an enigmatic stray cat, a chatty boy named Wybee(short for Wyborne)and a mysterious door in her living room which leads to a brick wall. One night, Coraline follows a mouse throught the door which leads to an alternate version of her house called the Other World. There, she encounters her Other Mother who runs it, who appears to be a friendlier doppleganger of her real mother. She cooks her lavish breakfast/dinners, introduces her to more entertaining versions of her already eccentric neighbors, and a silent copy of Wybee. However, Coraline soon realizes that this is all an elaborate trap, mainly because the cat in the Other World can talk and warns her. After O.M. tells her that can stay in this world forever as long as she gives up her eyes, Coraline runs away, but gets imprisioned with the ghosts of three other children that had given their souls to Other Mother, who is revealed to be a bedlam. As an extra insentive to get Coraline, she kidnaps her parents. The cat tells her to trick the bedlam into a game, so that she can free her parents and the ghost children. After facing the rather twisted residents of this nightmare as it unfolds around her, she has a final confrontation with Other Mother in her web. Coraline escapes, but the bedlam's hand makes it through to our side. Wybee helps bury the hand in a deep well, and then Coraline has a big garden party with the "real" members of her apartment building.<br /><br />This was an exceptionally creepy movie, but in a good way. Henry Selick manages to make this a hauntingly great experience, and definately not one for toddlers to see before hitting the hay. It was all done painstakingly with a large group of devoted animators whose efforts really paid off in the final product. The use of 3D is well done too without being looked at like some kind of gimmick, although its effect while watching it on TV is debatable. Regardless, this film should add to Selick's ongoing career as he's now signed on with Disney to do more feature films.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>This is a great movie with a horror theme, but hardly terrifying.  A young girl moves into an old house broken into apartments.  There is an empty apartment there where a secret world lives and the girl Coraline runs into.  Coraline goes through a bricked up door and finds another mother and another father very similar to her own but nicer and more interested in her.  She is invited to stay with them forever if only she agrees to allow them to sew buttons into her eyes.  Coraline finds this wonderful secret world has a terrible dark side.  The author Neil Gaiman wrote the book that the story comes from and it is great.  I used the Graphic novel in school and followed it up with the movie.  My students are middle school students and we had a great time.  The kids loved the book and the movie.  It wasn't too scary but very intriguing to them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Watching CORALINE, I was enthralled and puzzled. "Exactly what audience is this type of animated feature shooting for?" I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esque rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...<br /><br />Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC3W">The Happening</a>) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKLW">Crash</a>) adds to this sense.<br /><br />Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTFFO0">The Dead Girl</a>) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why?<br /><br />The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.<br /><br />This isn't <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWF8">Wall-E</a> or some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUP4">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> and you'll be closer, but not quite there.<br /><br />The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.<br /><br />The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.<br /><br />This is something to watch and ponder. But not with the kiddies. This is a thought-provoking animated film for adults and teens.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>CORALINE is by far the best example of stop motion I've ever seen.  While the look of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> wears with time, this is just perfectly smooth.  The colors are beautiful and the movement is gracious.  The film itself is disturbing in all the good ways, and the story is surprisingly dark and creepy considering it's essentially a children's movie.  The best way I can describe the feel of CORALINE is this.  Imagine if a creepier version of Pixar, known for making intelligent movies with strong themes that are thought-provoking for adults but still accessible for children, made a stop-motion flick.<br /><br />A lot of fans, ignorant to the fact that Tim Burton PRODUCED <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>, not directed it, will be fooled by the "from the director of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>" label on this film.  So it will definitely get the Burton crowd.  But, by and large, the story and visuals are superior to Burton's work.  Since it's adapted from Neil Gaiman's popular book, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to read before I saw the film, you know you can trust to be told a delightfully creepy tale.  The movie does find a nice balance between keeping the visuals stunning and maintaining the integrity of Gaiman's story.<br /><br />So far, this seems like a glowing review.  It's coming out that way because the film definitely has a lot going for it.  The animation deserves praise, the script is good, and the voice acting (which I haven't mentioned) is also great.  But, even at one-hundred minutes, this film feels way too long.  I was bored in parts, and felt that the movie could have lost fifteen minutes without losing a shred of its complexity.  I still enjoyed it, and wouldn't mind seeing it again.  Not sure if it's worth owning on DVD unless you're a huge animation fan or really dig Gaiman's work, but it's at least worth a rent!<br /><br />7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Wildly imaginative, intriguing, and delightful, Coraline is not a kid's film.

To say that this film is creative wouldn't do it justice - Neil Geiman and Henry Selick have a vision beyond anything previously seen on the screen (although the opening sequence is very much an homage to The Nightmare Before Christmas and is reminiscent of Corpse's Btide). I can imagine rewatching this dark tale over and over and gaining something from it every single time.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Coraline is a clever and inventive young girl, whose overworked and absent-minded parents tend to ignore her.  She discovers a portal into elsewhere, with an other mother who is all too eager to please.  If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  Luckily, Coraline's got the courage and pluck to face up to the absurdity and horror she faces on the other side.  Based on Neil Gaiman's inventive modern children's classic, it's a brilliant stop-motion adaptation, comparable in depth and theme and mystery to Lewis Carroll's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144042909X">Alice In Wonderland</a> and Hayao Miyazaki's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLEU">Spirited Away</a>.<br /><br />I saw this in 3-D in theaters, and just finished watching the 3-D version of the DVD on TV - on a 42" LCD flat screen, which may account for part of why it looked so good.  I was very impressed by the 3-D look - this is the first time I've seen a home version 3-D that really worked.  Of course the theatrical 3-D version was the first one I'd seen that didn't feel like a gimmick.  There are moments of "in your face" shock designed to surprise and impress - but what's really impressive is  the immersive character of the world.  It feels like a lived-in fantastic world with depth and texture - quite exciting.  The music sets just the right mood.  The voices are perfectly meshed with the characters - and unlike many contemporary animated films don't call attention to themselves.  I never once thought "that's Dakota Fanning" or "Terri Hatcher."<br /><br />While the colors seem slightly muted in the DVD's 3-D version, the depth is definitely there, and it looks nearly perfect if you watch it in the dark, as recommended.  This DVD set comes with 4 3D glasses, and includes both the 2D and 3D versions of the film, plus a digital version of the film and the standard "making of" and deleted scene features.  Highly recommended for parents and children whose imaginations haven't been blunted by the much less risky visions on display in most Disney and Dreamworks productions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Coraline is a visually stunning claymation type of film that is very reminicent of Tim Burton.  It revolves around a mom and dad and their daughter Coraline moving into a huge and sorta creepy looking victorian manor which is also occupied by other weird tenants. It is based on a children's book, but the look and feel of the film is certainly on the creepy side. Personally, I think younger kids would get frightenend after watching certain parts and there is this high wire act by these 2 old lady tenants that creeped ME out.<br /><br />The plot is actually a tad on the confusing side, especially towards the end, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The fantastical elements were wonderfully executed and the grim, washed-out feel to the film really created the mood. There are a few great but weird characters and it seems like everyone has some mystery to hide.<br /><br />It's a shame it didn't really get much recognition when it came out into theaters, but I predict it will do nicely on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>What a wonderful surprise Coraline turned out to be. I was a little apprehensive to view another Tim Burton movie due to the creepiness of Willie Wonka but I was happy to see that Coraline is nothing like that film. Full of charm and heart, Neil Gaiman's Coraline is the story of a girl who gets drawn into a seemingly wonderful fantasy world when she rebels against her every-day life pre-occupied parents.<br /><br />The stop-motion animation is put to full use in this film and adds to quirky fantasy. There are some scary moments in this film that may be too much for small kids but overall this is a very child-centric movie.<br /><br />One of the best animated films to come out in a while, Coraline is well worth your time and $$.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>Coraline has trouble getting used to her new home, one that she shares with a Mom and Dad who don't seem to have a lot time for her. The neighbors are weird and there isn't much around. So when she finds a doorway to another world, one that's like hers but better, she begins to get lured over to the other side...<br /><br />The animation is done really well and the storyline is for the most part consistent. I liked this film, even though it won't make my top tier in films. Some of the visuals are VERY strange, especially the show put on by the two ladies downstairs, but you should check this out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Coraline is a fine example of stop-motion animation at its finest; and one side of this DVD even has the feature length film in 3-D! The voiceovers are perfect and the animation is flawless; the story is quite captivating, too. I was fascinated by the plot and it never bored me. The musical score enhances the film, too.<br /><br />When the film starts, we meet young Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents who are so busy writing for a gardening catalog that they have no time for Coraline. Coraline's angst is even stronger because they just moved away from their old neighborhood into a dilapidated old building called the "Pink Palace Apartments;" Coraline has no friends here. She does meet Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey, Jr.), a quirky young boy, although they don't hit it off too well at the very start. There are the downstairs neighbors Miss April Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Miriam Forcible (Dawn French), two eccentrics who provide light comic relief from the scarier parts of the plot; and there's Mr. Sergei Alexander Bobinsky (Ian McShane), the upstairs neighbor who worked as a circus performer in his younger days. There's also the neighborhood cat who sometimes tags along after Wybie.<br /><br />Even with these new neighbors, things are pretty dull for Coraline; but things change when one day she discovers a door behind an armoire. Coraline begs her mother to open the door but they discover nothing but a wall of bricks! Coraline's mother brushes it off; but Coraline remains curious. She eventually discovers that the bricks hide a tunnel to another world just like hers--only much better. Her "other parents" are very affectionate and they anticipate Coraline's every whim; they spend time with her and she has lots of fun--there's even a circus act with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible that lets Coraline get in on the act! She's having a ball and she simply returns automatically to her real home after she goes to sleep in her "other" home.<br /><br />But the third time Coraline goes to her "other" parents and her "other" home, things start to get creepy real fast. Coraline's "other" mother and father want to sew buttons into her eyes and keep her there for good! Coraline also discovers the souls of three children whose lives have been eaten up and destroyed by the "other" mother; now Coraline finally realizes what her "other" parents want from her. Coraline's "other" parents undergo just a slight change of appearance, too.<br /><br />The plot can go anywhere from here. Coraline eventually gets back to her real home, but I won't tell you much about that so as not to ruin it for you. But what does Coraline do when she discovers that her "other" mother has taken and trapped her real parents? Can Coraline get her real parents back from this incredibly wicked "other" mother? Will the talking cat from the "other" world help Coraline or hinder her? Will Wybie help Coraline--and, if so, how? No spoilers here--watch and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has an optional running commentary with director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais. In addition, one side of the DVD has a 3-D version of this film.<br /><br />Coraline impresses me as a very good thriller that has outstanding stop-motion animation. People who enjoy thrillers, animated films, and pictures that use science fiction and fantasy to further the plot would do well to add this DVD to their collections.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>The 3D effect is practically non-existing.

It's amazing that 'stop-action' continues in this digital world but the two work together for this sublimely creepy and fun film. 3-D is great for home format. 2-D is like 3-D. BD is awesome A/V.

It's far too scary to be a kids' movie; not scary enough to be an adults' movie, and it gets off to an awfully slow start, with many unnecessary characters.<br /><br />And it was just to trippy, too dreamy.  I know it comes from a book, and it probably works better as a book.  The relentlessly surreal sequences toward the end got to be too much.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I'm a huge fan of this type of animation.  I like it better than the CGI stuff.  As usual, Tim Burton casts u in a fantastic magical world.  I would have rather had the voices in Coraline British, rather than English, it would have made the film a bit more mystical and intelligent sounding.  The plot was a bit confusing, you really have to pay attention.  I was more fixated on the beautiful, organic animation and vivid colours.  Coraline, Nitemare b4 X-mas, James and the Giant Peach and Corpse Bride are all fantastic films.  I hope they continue to make these types of films, the time they spend to make them is worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>For starters the stop motion animation and 3-D effects are pretty darned good here.  That's about it.  My complaint with alot of 3-D movies is that they fashion the movies around the effects at the expense of the story.  There's a story alright but the problem here is that when it's not confusing it's downright creepy.  Who were they targetting for this flick?  Little kids who might get the bejesus scared out of them?  Disaffected adolescents who glory in unsavory imagery?  Whatever!  Ultimately "Coraline" is just a waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this movie made me ask myself the question,"do i want to continue to keep watching movies considering how evil they've become"? the movie is about a little girl who is ignored by her horrible parents and retreats into a secret path to another better world.then she is threatened with abuse,trapped,forced to see her friend after he has been abused .this is nothing that should be in a cartoon.much less,not advertised as for adults only.the girl is locked in a closet and meets 3 other dead children who died there.this is seriously messed up!i also noticed during the credits and junk that no one mentioned the people at dc comics who coralines evil mom is based on.captain hellfire or something like that.i love comic books but MAN do they have to be so evil?"watchmen" was the epitome of evil comic book movies.i even hear rob zombie has made one.im just not sure why a so called little kids movie is so horrifying.i cant belive society is so lax on evil now that they would allow this to go on.i just cant seem to find new movies these days that dont remind me how F'd up life really is and how far we have all strayed from the right path.i think if you let your children watch this ,you are a bad parent.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1. Supposedly this is supposed to be a "nontraditional" animated film... which it is.  Unfortunately, it's also a very lousy film.  First of all, it's not for kids; it's dark, it has a sarcastic view of the world, it's scary at times and it's definitely not funny.  2nd of all, it's not going to appeal to any human being of any age range, largely for the afore mentioned reasons and also because the whole plot is strange, although understandable.<br /><br />2. Again, with many films and art in general, if one wants to delude themselves that they can appreciate "higher art", then go ahead, but for the average Mr and Mrs America + 2 kids etc... do yourself a favor and skip this dud.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>As a big fan of stop-motion animation (using physical objects), any time a stop-motion film gets wide distribution I celebrate.  Simply put, stop-motion animation is my favorite film making medium.  I did it as a kid and I appreciate its unique place in the world of film art today.  Unlike 2d cell animation (Disney style), 3d stop-motion animation seams to be finding a place in the computer driven world of feature films.  Though not specifically advancing the art of stop-motion animation, Coraline dutifully keeps it alive for all the right reasons.<br /><br />WARNING: RISK OF SEVERE GEEK JUICING BEYOND THIS POINT!!!  PLEASE WEAR EYE PROTECTION!!<br /><br />STOP-MOTION = CREEPY<br />If you want a fantasy to be creepy, inject a little stop-motion and you will be successful.  If you look back at prominent films that employ Stop-motion it becomes clear: Corps Bride, Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were Rabbit, Chicken Run and everything Ray Harryhausen did.  Stop-motion usually equates to creepy or fantastic.  Most fans of the technique would agree that it's the slightly jerky and awkward movements that contribute to the surreal and eerie feel that is so effective in these films.  "Coraline" is a very creepy film and even more so for employing stop-motion.<br /><br />TAKING A STEP BACK FROM "CORPSE BRIDE"<br />In my humble opinion "Corpse Bride" was the best feature film done entirely in stop-motion.  As the first film to use digital still cameras to animate 3d objects, "Corpse Bride" set the standard for character expression, meaningful movement and Stop-motion artistry.  "Coraline" takes a slight step back from "Corpse Bride" in its animation technique.  Things don't move quite as smoothly.  Characters don't have the same sense of weight or expressiveness.  All of that aside, "Coraline" is still an excellent piece of art and I enjoyed watching it despite not meeting "Corpse Bride" standards.<br /><br />MOVING A STEP AHEAD OF "CORPSE BIRDE"<br />Where "Coraline" advances the art of film making may not be in stop motion particularly, but rather in its hybrid technique use.  "Coraline" may well be the first film to combine stop-motion with CGI and very effectively in my opinion.  Many people revile CGI due to over-reliance on it by many in the film industry.  Very often films start to look like video games.  In "Coraline" CGI is used strictly as a background device.  Some might call this "cheating", but I can't imagine how this film could be achieved as effectively without it.  As much as I love stop-motion, CGI has its place and this was a creative place to use it.<br /><br />ACTORS WHO DON'T SING<br />"Coraline" is unique for a stop-motion film in that there are no extraneous musical numbers in the place of conversation.  That does not mean there is no music at all, it just means that the music occurs when it might in reality:  While someone plays the piano, in a theater, and at the Circus.  I was taken aback when the characters broke out in song during "Corpse Bride".  I never expected it and it took a couple of viewings to get used to it.  In Coraline the music was natural and unobtrusive.  Though I've never heard Dakota Fanning (Coraline) or Teri Hatcher (Mom 1 and Mom 2) sing, I'm not disappointed I haven't yet.  They both did excellent work here with Hatcher being the surprise of the day.  She personally made the "Stepford Wives" look downright inviting.  I don't want to take the time to talk about all the actors, though I should mention all involved make significant contributions.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT THE STORY "GEEK-MIAS"?<br />I enjoyed the story quite a bit.  The question is, will you?  Here's how my family received this film.<br />WIFE:  she doesn't like being reminded of her own mortality, so she was not too thrilled with a story that has dead children in it.  She thought the movie was ok but didn't like the subject matter.<br />SON:  as a sensitive 6 year old, he was somewhat frightened by it.  He liked the format and the fantasy, but was less than thrilled with the bugs and scary stuff, same as my wife.<br />DAUGHTER:  She liked it.  As a 10 year old, she related a lot to Coraline because she's close to the same age and has awful parents just like Coraline... ...wait, did I say that?  Regardless, I've raised her to enjoy scary stuff so she was with it.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />ME:  I love stop-motion and the story was original enough to keep me guessing.  There were dead children, so peril was well established.  There are plenty of quirky (crazy) characters and plenty of creepy stuff too, so I was well satisfied.<br />THE 4 YEAR OLD SITTING NEXT TO ME:  "Mommy, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN!!"  I guess she didn't like it.  That warmed my heart.<br /><br />LIKE THE CHILDREN OF "HAMLIN", I'M HOOKED<br />Though not reaching the heights that "Corpse Bride" did, "Coraline" immediately went on my DVD wish-list after leaving the theater.  Seeing it in 3D was really not important and actually a distraction.  Seeing it without the glasses is fine.  The story is dark like many fairy tales and harkens back to the "Pied Piper of Hamlin" which creeped me out as a kid, so your kids might be a little disturbed.  For fans of stop-motion, it's a reason to smile.<br /><br />-Story...............4 Stars<br />-Animation..........4.5 Stars<br />-Characters..........4.5 Stars<br />-Family Appeal...3 Stars<br /><br />Total.....3.87 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />"The Nightmare Before Christmas" was a pretty groundbreaking film that mixed stop motion animation with music and some good old fashioned creepiness. "Coraline" continues this trend though to me is fairly darker than "Nightmare". A young girl named Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) moves to a small town with her parents and she's not happy about it, she finds her life here boring and she doesn't care for her parents inability to pay attention to her.<br /><br />One night she finds a blocked door which leads to a familiar world, but her parents are nicer, everything is happier and brighter and Coraline of course likes this world and would like to stay but her other "mother" (Teri Hatcher) wants her to sew buttons onto her eyes. This alarms Coraline and the rest of the film involves her trying to figure out the mystery of this other world.<br /><br />The visuals are top notch, the voice acting fits very well, the story is pretty detailed and there's some good elements of creepiness that make this film not really for younger kids. I personally enjoyed this film as everything just came together and made for a well rounded film. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of "Coraline," brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous "other" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed "other mother" (Teri Hatcher) and matching "other father," (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book "Coraline" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James and the Giant Peach." Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />"Coraline" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures -- definitely for fans of Gaiman, dark fantasy and really creepy stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Last year was rather wonderful when you consider the smart and engaging animated films that were released.  Between the Oscar winning `Up', Anderson's crack at animation, `Fantastic Mr. Fox' and the ghoulishly fantastic `Coraline', you have a spectacular year in this field that reigns supreme as the best of the decade.  While probably my least favorite of the three, `Coraline' is still one of the better films of that year and a definite must-see for any film enthusiast.<br /><br />In tone, this film is far different than the other two I mentioned.  In fact, all three films are so different, and I think that is another reason why this year was so great in this field.  We were offered a variety of films that excite and entertain and appeal to different sides of our cinematic taste.<br /><br />`Coraline' is dark and moody.  The production design here is simply flawless, brilliantly capturing the mood and feel of the film without going so overboard as to appear clunky and campy.  The attention to detail, whether it be with the characters or with the surroundings, is astonishing to look at.  Above all else, `Coraline' is a visual feast.<br /><br />Still, looks aren't everything.<br /><br />`Coraline' tells the story of a bored little girl.  Having just moved to an old house with her work obsessed parents, Coraline finds that she has nothing to do and no one to do it with.  Her parents are so confined to their work that they disregard Coraline as seemingly unimportant and her only companions are either crazy (the circus fare she lives beside) or annoying (a strange kid named Wybie).  When Wybie finds a doll that resembles Coraline, things start to change.  Coraline finds a secret door that eventually takes her to an alternate world where she has `other' parents, perfected variations of her own.  Coraline loves being in their company, but when they attempt to make her a permanent part of their lives things turn a tad ugly.<br /><br />The emotionally chord behind `Coraline' involves the struggle to find balance in that parent/children relationship.  On both ends we can find ourselves working against unity.  It is apparent that Coraline's parents don't consider her feelings enough (they seem almost harsh on the outset) but it is also apparent that Coraline is your average selfish teenager (or pre-teen).  Sometimes we have to take a step back and see things through the eyes of our parent or our child in order to find that unity; meeting halfway so-to-speak.  Coraline learns that the hard way, but better late than never.<br /><br />Visually stunning and emotionally profound, `Coraline' is smart and charmingly creepy.  It is not a film for everyone, and some children may find it a tad scary (some adults may even find it a tad scary), but that is the point of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>We loved Corpse Bride, also Nightmare Before Christmas, so I thought this might be a similar style movie and that we would enjoy it too, however, I can't say that the experience was entirely positive.  A six year old watched with me, once movie was over, she said she didn't like it.  I asked why...she said she didn't like the "Mom with the Button Eyes."  FYI: Maybe it's too much for a six year old.<br /><br />I think the reason I wasn't over impressed is that I really loved the book (Neil has written some books that I'm crazy about!) and I think this was a let down to the Coraline I had in my mind as I read his book.  Isn't that the way it usually goes?  If you read the book first, no movie can compare.<br /><br />If you are still determined to try this one, go ahead, because it was not what I would call a complete bust.  It's nicely done, just not living up to the book in my eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>'Coraline' is another fine offering from the man who directed 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and James And The Giant Peach. The film has Tim Burton written all over it, but to my knowledge he had nothing to do with this sinister little film. I'm a sucker for Stop Motion Animation and 'Coraline ' delivers some excellent visuals that might put the little ones(under 10)in your bed every night for weeks after seeing it.  I bought the Blu Ray set and it looks and sounds fantastic, but the 3-D is disappointing as the color seems to be very off or washed out. I haven't seen any 3-D films that look right in my home, so maybe it's my home theater equipment? If you're a fan of stop motion animation and things that are macabre, then you should love the setting in this wicked little movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Awesome visuals dominate this movie, but I wasn't totally enthralled with it. The lead character of Coraline wasn't really all that nice, and it was hard to cheer for her, or even like her very much. I thought the only standout character was the 'Other Mother', voiced by Teri Hatcher (who oddly enough did the real mother as well, but that was less interesting to me).</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>After Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) move to the Pink Palace Apartments, Coraline becomes frustrated by her lack of friends and her parents not paying attention to her as they work on their gardening catalog. When she runs into her neighbor Wybie (Robert Bailee Jr.), he gives her a doll he found in his grandmother's house that looks just like her. Shortly after receiving the doll Coraline finds a small door in the wall of their apartment that opens up to a brick wall. But later that night jumping mice who seemingly belong to upstairs neighbor, The Amazing Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), lead her back to the door where she finds an alternate world where her parents treat her like she longs to be treated. Each night she revisits this wonderful world only to eventually find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be.<br /><br />It's often a preconceived misconception that Tim Burton directed A Nightmare Before Christmas. As much as Burton wanted to direct Nightmare, he was unfortunately too busy working on Batman Returns, and was forced to place Henry Selick in the director's chair. Since then, A Nightmare Before Christmas has become a classic, being played every year in limited release around the country. This time Selick takes on Neil Gaiman. Neil Gaiman has become a much revered science fiction/ fantasy writer having written such work as the novel Stardust, which was turned into a movie in 2007, and the comic book series The Sandman as well as Coraline. Writing stories that are uniquely original with his comics including visuals that are stunning and unique in their own right, Gaiman is the perfect writer to bring to the big screen. And if you're considering using stop motion animation there are few directors other than Selick that one can think of to bring Gaiman's work to the big screen with it's integrity intact.<br /><br />After seeing Coraline, I have to say that I can't think of any other filmmaker other than Tim Burton that could have done this movie justice. The attention to detail, as it was with Nightmare, is meticulous. I generally have a little problem with not being able to completely escape reality when watching a stop-motion animation film, but with Coraline I didn't have much of a problem with that. With too much of this style of animation the director seems scared to make things dirty, gritty, and real, but Selick doesn't seem to have that much of a problem in this movie. That really aids this film as the real world Coraline lives in is a gritty world to her as opposed to the alternate reality she visits and, at first, prefers to her real life. The writing is, for the most part, impeccable despite a few clunky lines, crafting a unique story with characters that you feel for and are compelled to root for when their situations go awry.<br /><br />Of course, with any animated movie the characters are only as good as the people who voice them. Here you have some great actors such as Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds, Man on Fire, I Am Sam), Keith David (Crash, Requiem for a Dream, Pitch Black), and Ian McShane (Deadwood, Kings, Sexy Beast). The voice actor that really stands out, though, is Teri Hatcher as Coraline's mother Mel Jones. As Mel Jones, Teri Hatcher doesn't just play the real world mother, but also the alternate mother creating a world for Coraline, luring her in to steal her soul. As Mel, Hatcher really makes you feel both sides of the coin of the character. She makes you feel that the alternate mother is the best fit for Coraline, but when you find out the truth she makes you despise the other mother and feel for the mother that you at first despised. This mixture of emotions for one actress to make you convey shows the brilliance of the performance as well as the visuals used by the filmmakers in the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, later in the movie as Coraline searches for her parents and the souls of lost children the movie devolves into what feels like video game mode. The souls of the lost children speak to her as though she's a character played by the the director rather than feeling like an organic transition. This could have been a conscious decision by the filmmakers but it feels a little gimmicky. When I got to what I thought was going to be the end of the game that the other mother was playing with Coraline I honestly felt like I was playing a game of something like Mario approaching Bowser for the final battle. That would be great if I was playing Mario, but I don't want to be taken out of a movie with the feeling that I'm playing a game that I'm not really playing.<br /><br />In the end though, I fell in love with the world and plight of Coraline. I'm still not sure if I will own it, but I think it would hold up greatly in repeated viewings. I do recommend this movie, especially if you like stop motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or somewhat gothic styles movies. Selick did a great job of translating a Gaiman classic to the big screen creating a unique and original film. Before you show the kids I highly recommend that you watch it yourself. While this may be stop motion animation there are scenes that may be scarier than you'd like your kids to experience and one scene of an older woman in extremely skimpy clothing.<br /><br />4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>To be honest, Neil Gaiman's novel left me a bit cold and not at all invested in the lead character of Coraline. This is one of those pretty rare instances in which I prefer the film adaptation to the original literary source. Because Coraline may still be not be as endearing as Dorothy Gale or Pippi Longstocking or even Helena from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BT97AO">Mirrormask</a> (also written by Gaiman), but at least the stop-motion animation looks absolutely cool and bizarre. CORALINE the film conveys the same uneasy and feverish vibe that was so palpable in the book, and I wouldn't be at all surprised that little kids upon seeing this movie end up with nightmares. The quick premise breakdown: a lonely little girl wanders thru a hidden door and finds a better version of her life. But is it really a better version?<br /><br />The sense I got is that her parents are so distracted and neglectful that they couldn't even work up the energy to give her a proper name. Michigan girl Coraline Jones with her blue hair and her folks have just now moved into the Pink Palace Apartments and she doesn't waste time in exploring her new home. And what an odd home it is. Coraline soon runs into fellow tenants, an acrobatic foreign old gent perfecting a mice act and two seriously dog-loving old spinsters dwelling in the basement apartment. There's a mangy cat who knows more than it lets on. And then there's that peculiar door that's been painted over... and we know, don't we, that it won't take long at all before Coraline finds out what's on the other side of that door?<br /><br />What she finds on the other side is a spooky length of tunnel which leads into a fantastic alternate world, and this world apes Coraline's new digs. But what's disturbing is that Coraline promptly encounters creepy mimics of her parents and neighbors. Instead of immediately perturbed, Coraline is instead equally bemused and enchanted because this set of parents, this Other Mother and Other Father, is fun and caring and attentive, showering Coraline with love and mouth-watering dishes and treating her to marvelous magical sights. Except that these parents have buttons sewn into their eye sockets. And then Coraline runs into warped counterparts of her real world neighbors, and even a version of that annoying kid Wybie (short for Wyborn). But everything seems so perfect and idyllic in this other dimension, and Coraline is so gratified to be the center of attention for once that she dismisses the worrying fact that people in this place HAVE FRIGGIN' BUTTONS FOR EYES! Inevitably, though, the doubts start to set in. And if she's not careful, Coraline may find herself forever trapped on the wrong side of the door.<br /><br />Henry Selick, director of CORALINE, also directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas (2-Disc Collector's Edition + Digital Copy)</a>, and don't be surprised at how similar these two films are in terms of the surreal and exaggerated and unsettling animation. I dunno, to me, there's just something so fundamentally disquieting and macabre about people with buttons for eyes. The film also features wistful ghosts of dead children, victims of the Other Mother. And adding to the colorful parade of grotesque, we learn that the two nice old ladies, as nice as they are, tend to stuff their dead pets.<br /><br />It took a while for me to warm up to Coraline Jones. She's a little mean and peevish, and she's not too nice to that kid Wybie. But she did win me over in the end as she demonstrates gumption when things take an alarming turn, and it doesn't hurt that Dakota Fanning provides the vocal talent. Meanwhile, Teri Hatcher does double duty as the Other Mother and also Coraline's real mom. CORALINE may not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy - in fact, it may throw you off your comfort zone - but it's certainly worth watching, for its memorable twisty visuals and its spindly, wildly imaginative characters. The glaring theme is parental neglect, but you can also draw out a pretty classic adage: "There's no place like home." Even if home is someplace as garish-sounding as the Pink Palace Apartments.<br /><br />Creepy button eyes. Ugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>I would echo other reviews of "Coraline" - an absolute wow on the 2D BLU RAY image - but gimmicky, dark and blurry on the 3D version.<br /><br />This is aimed at both the kids and their accompanying parents - childlike enough to capture the wee ones for two hours, but adult enough in other ways to keep us old-folk glued. My 11 and 15 year olds loved it, though I would say it might be a bit 'too' scary for children younger than that (it's quite sinister in parts - this is not saccharine Disney, but Tim Burton territory - and he rarely panders nor holds back).<br /><br />Four flimsy card glasses are provided for the 3D version (you choose either 2D or 3D from the main menu), but as you watch it, they irritate and you're far too aware of them. Pixar's "Up" had proper 3D glasses when we went to see it at the cinema and they made a huge difference to both the quality of the 3D effect and the comfort (too busy enjoying the film to notice).<br /><br />The 2D version couldn't be more different. The BLU RAY image is awesome - really bringing out the workmanship that went into each shot. The richness of the animation and the hugely imaginative way all the characters look in every single scene - it's all an absolute blast. The vocal work is typically ace too (Dakota Fanning shines) and the story of parents and their children straying apart is like a dark Brothers Grimm tale that will unfortunately ring too true for many. The extras are superb too. Shame the whole thing is let down by the 3D side of things.<br /><br />To sum up - and despite some niggles - the gobsmacking beauty of the print, the great voice talent and the dead clever grown-up story make it all worthwhile.<br /><br />This is one you'll watch again and again - and your kids will impress their friends with it.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>4? stars<br /><br />[First, a brief warning: The faint of heart should steer clear. If you or your kiddies don't want to be frightened or disturbed or enchanted, avoid "Coraline" at all costs! Let's just get that out of the way and move on.<br />Now, for those of you who thrive on dark and delightfully creepy fantasy, this movie is right up your alley.]<br /><br />First of all, I fell in love with this story as soon as I plunged into the book by the wonderful British storyteller Neil Gaiman, who is cemented as an icon in the world of fantasy. I am an ardent fan of children's fantasy tales, horror, and all things British... so, I was charmed to the hilt with this dark and wondrous tale. And now there is a fanastic movie to enjoy.<br /><br />This stop-motion movie does the book justice, totally. The character designs, sets, lighting, cinematography, lovely musical score-- everything is very nicely done. You can tell that a lot of work went into this movie. There is plenty here to entertain everyone, and enough peril and danger and scary stuff to satisfy folks like myself who enjoy a good villain and some macabre trappings. Maybe you have to be a fan of all things creepy to appreciate "Coraline". I just happen to love scary films, fiction, and ideas.<br /><br />The character voices are terrific. Teri Hatcher is very effective as the Other Mother and the real mother. Dakota Fanning, Ian McShane, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders all contribute quite nicely.<br /><br />If you (or your family) have a penchant for fantasy or horror, this is for you. (And if you're into animation, all the better.) It smacks of the best Roald Dahl tales, of Alice's wild adventures in Wonderland, and of classic horror movies I grew up loving.<br /><br />Henry Selick does a top notch job directing this movie, which pulls you in quickly and takes you on a spooky and colorful ride. Certain things will stand out for you, as they did for me: the opening credits sequence which shows scenes of the Other Mother creating the doll... the enchanting and gorgeous garden in the Other World... the audience of black Scottish Terriers watching Ms. Spink and Ms. Forcible's show... and the emotional core of the story, too.<br /><br />Part of the pleasure for someone who has read the book is seeing these scenarios that were previously only within one's imagination; now they come to life on screen almost magically, and it's the next best thing to revisiting the book.<br /><br />I didn't mind that the setting was changed from England to America; I guess Hollywood still thinks we can't handle that so much. No big thing. I thought the addition of the Wyborn character actually worked well in the story; In the book, Coraline talks to herself a great deal, and I suppose that does not work well on film, so they added a character to help with exposition and to help Coraline in her quest.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>This production & story was a masterful, creatively sculpted work of art.

Why neglected, you ask? Because, thanks in large part to its stylistic tricks and the presence of Danny Elfman, ask ten fans of the movie who directed it, and you'll get nine people who say "Tim Burton." (Burton was actually the writer of the story upon which the movie is based, after a brilliant adaptation by Michael McDowell.) There can be little doubt that Burton had a profound influence on Selick, given his later work, but Selick has proven himself quite capable of standing on his own. Here, he partners up with another dark-fantasy great, Neil Gaiman, for an adaptation of one of Gaiman's finest novels, Coraline. And I have to say, this is the best film I saw on the big screen since El Laberinto del Fauno. Selick, who also wrote the screen adaptation, nails Gaiman's book in a way I wasn't sure could be done.<br /><br />Plot: Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) and her family move to a spooky old boardinghouse in the middle of nowhere thanks to her mother (voice of Teri Hatcher)'s new writing assignment. While she does make a tentative new friend, the nerdy Wybie (voice of The Happening's Robert Bailey Jr.), she's roundly unsatisfied with her home life, and wishes she could find something better. That night, she discovers a tunnel into an alternate dimension, where she meets analogues of her mother and father (voice of Daily Show regular John Hodgman) who seem to have no interest other than pleasing her. The only other denizen of the house who can travel between the two worlds is a cat (voice of Keith David), who cautions Coraline that not all is as it seems. Coraline is willing to forego warnings for cake, but with the help of some of the house's more eccentric inhabitants, Coraline discovers that not all is, in fact, as it seems.<br /><br />The house's other inhabitants are brought to life wonderfully, and with incredible talent (French and Saunders in fine form, Ian McShane), but it's Fanning and Bailey who steal the show here; they bring a magic to these characters that's rare even in live action. I tend to think of voicing animation as the opposite of silent film; rather than having no voice and having to get things across with exaggerated gesture, you have no gesture at all, and have to get things across with voice. Voice, however, is more subtle, and overdoing it can kill a movie (or a series, as anyone who's seen English-dubbed anime series can attest). Fanning has already proven herself an accomplished voice actress, but it's hard to believe this is Bailey's first outing. Good stuff, indeed. Hatcher is right at home playing a desperate housewife, of course, and French and Saunders just do what they do best, and it works. Heck, the whole cast have themselves a great time here, and it shows. It's all backed up with Selick's trademark creepy animation, that works just as well here as it did in The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. (It may be heresy, but I'll note it, at least in passing; the film is currently rated a tenth of a point higher at IMDB than is The Nightmare Before Christmas. Shocking!) As a side note, making Teri Hatcher's character look like, well, Teri Hatcher will be an extra kick for Desperate Housewives fans.<br /><br />In the afterword to the novel, Gaiman notes that while adults are likely to read it as a horror novel, children see it more as an adventure, and tend not to be scared by it. This is one aspect of the book that Selick didn't translate, and my thirteen-year-old daughter (who is rapidly becoming a connoisseur of bad horror films, just like her dad) was extremely creeped out by a few scenes towards the climax of the film. You may want to shoo the younger kiddies out of the room before watching this, but no matter. The adults will be just as charmed by it as the older kids will be. Maybe even more so. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>When was the last time you had a good scare?

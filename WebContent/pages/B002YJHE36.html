Harvard Symbologist is called to the Vatican to investigate the kidnapping of four cardinals. The kidnapper promises to murder each one of them to avenge a centuries old crime. The movie then develops in to a thriller with its chase scenes and near escapes. Tom Hank as Robert Langdon is good; he has a new partner in Vittoria Vetra. The movie worked because it is a travelogue on the Vatican with its incredible history and gives you brief glimpses in the world of the Papacy and its rituals and traditions.  The movie takes us on a historical tour of the Vatican and surroundings. For me the movie belonged to Evan Mcgregor who played the humble servant of god with ulterior motives and fit his part to a perfect T. Armin Mueller Stahl, whom I last enjoyed in the `The International' was great as trying to preserve the traditions of the church. Loved it as a fast paced entertainer so I gave it four stars.2/1/10</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>ANGELS & DEMONS<br /><br />STARRING: Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller-Stahl<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman; based on the novel by Dan Brown<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Ron Howard<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Thriller<br />Release Date: 15 May 2009<br /><br />Being arguably the best actor in Hollywood, Tom Hanks could probably make any bad movie good. Throw in additional acting talents like Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl and the brilliant directing of a genius like Ron Howard and can you really go wrong? I doubt it.<br /><br />Angels & Demons is a big bright and shiny Hollywood adventure and isn't afraid to show it. Its premise is absolutely ridiculous and everyone in it knows it and we know it; especially if we saw the first installment, The Da-Vinci Code. Going forward from there, we can relax and enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />Tom Hanks (a religious man who believes in God in real life) received a lot of negative press, when he filmed The Da-Vinci Code. That film was even more absurd than this one but Tom's argument was that the point of the film was never intended to be taken literally. It's an adventure film; nothing more. The same goes for Angels & Demons and I am sure he and director Ron Howard and everyone Else involved, will go through it all over again.<br /><br />What's the touchy subject matter? Why, religion of course. The first film focused on the belief that the Bible was filled with lies about who Jesus Christ really was and this one deals with the dark underbelly of the Catholic Church and its oldest enemy: science. So can we forgive the filmmakers for obviously not being allowed to film on location? I think we can. You can hardly notice anyway; they did a great job re-constructing Rome. I wonder if they built it in a day.<br /><br />I have heard from others that they believe the film doesn't necessarily try to make the Catholic Church look bad. I have my own relationship with God and am in no way Catholic at all so I'm not in the middle here and I say very sarcastically, Yeah Right! What are you going to tell me next, that W. was a pro-Bush film?<br /><br />I found it blatantly obvious that the filmmakers are against Catholicism. Now I haven't read the books (yet) so maybe they are just adapting the material to the screen as was previously written by Dan Brown, but even if that were the case, it still seems like some things were purposely placed in the film. Maybe it's just the artist in me that picks up on these commonly missed subtleties in films, or maybe it's all in my head. After all, what makes my opinion better than anyone Else's? The only advocate I have for it is that as of yet, I have never once disagreed with myself.<br /><br />We see Priests talking on their cell phones, wearing dark sun glasses and smoking cigarettes, in their robes. Some may not see anything wrong with this and I am not implying that this makes the characters bad people. But you have to ask yourself, `Why did they show us that shot?' It's a very quick shot and then it's gone, so what was its purpose?<br /><br />It is constantly mentioned throughout the course of the film that the Catholic Church has covered things up over the years. I'm not saying that this isn't true; I'm just saying it's in the film. Even at the end of the film, all of the events that just took place are covered up and the information that is put out to the press is a lie.<br /><br />When one member of the Church tries to express how the Church gives to the people, he is shut down with the fact that the Church is also a bank and houses at least one Mercedes and several people's assets.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't seen the film, just skip this paragraph. I'm sorry but this point just has to be disclosed. Let's not forget the fact that the villain in the film is the only character who completely disagrees with science and is 100 percent pro-God (as far as we know he is the only one, some others may be as well, but it is not shown to us). I'm not saying the character isn't bad (yes he is a murderer); I'm simply saying that this priest is made into the villain and his faith in the Lord is stronger than anyone Else's. It feels a little weird to me. Why would you want the villain to be the only guy in the film sticking up for God completely, if you weren't trying to make the Church look bad? This does make for an interesting plot twist, totally. I'm only referring to the point that to me it is obvious that there is anti-Catholicism viewpoints pressed upon us in the film. There is also the scene where he burns himself alive at the end of the film; I don't think I need to discuss that one any further. And in the scene with him and the head of the Swiss Guard towards the end, they clearly wanted us to side with the opinion of the Guard over the Priest; thus he having no comeback to what was said, even if he was wrong.<br /><br />There are several more of these elements but I haven't even gotten to the plot yet.<br /><br />The film starts off with a very dangerous weapon being stolen from a Swiss laboratory. The weapon is simply a special something created through science known as anti-matter. Next we have the death of the Pope. Now someone must be chosen to take his place. Coincidentally four of the favorite selectees are kidnapped and the Vatican is notified that at eight, nine, 10 and 11 p.m., one-by-one they will be murdered throughout the city of Rome. Then at midnight, the stolen anti-matter will lose its battery juice; causing it to explode and completely annihilate Vatican City.<br /><br />The conflict in the film arises from an old enemy of the Catholic Church, known as the Illuminati; a group of scientists who seek revenge for the torment they once suffered from the Catholic Church for simply expressing their scientific beliefs. Of course, none of the Catholic characters in the film ever deny that these things took place and none of them shine light on the fact that it was wrong. It was so long ago that it is sort of brushed off and accepted.<br /><br />As if the plot itself doesn't have `Big Hollywood Movie' written all over it, every single sequence from there out is a fun movie-magic-ride, reeking of warm buttery popcorn.<br /><br />Enter Tom Hanks, returning as Robert Langdun; the awesome symbolist who isn't afraid to poke fun at his own profession. We meet him in a swimming pool at Harvard University, of all places. He is met by a man requesting him to accompany him to Rome. Langdun has a brilliantly written opening set of one-liners. We are forced into liking him instantly.<br /><br />Langdun has been requested by the Vatican (despite the bad taste he put in their mouth with all of his shenanigans from The Da-Vinci Code) to help them discover the locations to where the priests are to be executed. We learn that Langdun's side goal in the film will be to obtain the missing documents he needs from the Vatican archives (which he was denied several times by Vatican Officials) to finish his novel. He has no outright intention of going about achieving this goal; we just know that it will at some point come up again, because we have all been to the movies once or twice and that makes it fun.<br /><br />The Church teams him up with a woman who for cinematic purposes will accompany Hanks around Vatican City as a form of eye candy and someone to exchange various dramatic one-liners with. Again, fun though. Plus they throw in a plot joiner slash back story that her father was murdered when the anti-matter was stolen, so naturally she'd want to be a part of all this.<br /><br />The entire thing seems pointless. Why wouldn't the killer just murder all of these priests and then blow up Vatican City? Or better yet just blow up Vatican City with the priests inside? Why all of the cat and mouse chasing around? The answer is because then the movie would be over, silly.<br /><br />Langdun somehow knows exactly where to look for clues in the Vatican archives (although he has never been there) and of course manages to use those clues to find the location of the next victim. Once he arrives at said location, he finds more clues to lead him to the exact location of the priest.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is another side-story going on back at the Vatican. It has been discovered that the previous Pope was in fact murdered.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor gives an outstanding performance as Camerlengo McKenna and is grief stricken at this discovery. He's a high priest, put kind of in charge but not entirely as he still gets his but chewed by Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) while they seal the doors to their private chamber to select a new Pope.<br /><br />No-one seems bothered by the fact that their fellow priests will be slain. Even after a few of them actually are murdered, there is still no cause for alarm or a need to show emotion.<br /><br />The Swiss Guard has implemented a strategy in hopes of finding the killer by randomly shutting down power grids to certain locations of the city. This adds to a great deal of suspense to the film as our characters are already pressed for time as it is, and of course undoubtedly some of them will become trapped when this happens.<br /><br />Is the movie a bit over the top? Definitely. Is it worth your time anyway? You-betcha. If you are of Catholic faith will you be left with itchy elbows and an upset stomach? Probably, but at least you will have been entertained.<br /><br />The movie does exactly that. It entertains us and what adds to the value of its entertainment isn't the story and the ridiculous plot; it's the great characters and the amazing actors that bring them to life, that keep us intrigued. Everyone did a great job here. Armin Mueller-Stahl could very well be elected the next Pope; and after his performance as the Swiss Guard, Stellan Skarsgard will have no problem starting his own security company, should he ever tire of acting.<br /><br />Ron Howard is brilliant behind the camera whether he's doing a comedic classic with Jim Carrey (Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas) or a Masterpiece of suspense like Angels & Demons. Yes he may make some people uncomfortable with this film; but that's why there's Cable folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Following up on the box office success of The Da Vinci Code, Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's book is a great movie in a year of great movies.  With Tom Hanks returning as Professor Langdon, the movie also features the beautiful Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer in probably her biggest role so far.  This time around, our scientist hero, Dr. Langon, is running around Rome trying to find four kidnapped cardinals and a bomb before midnight.  Not quite like the TV show "24", but close in its fast paced action interspersed with good dialogue.  The key of the movie is the hidden motives of multiple characters, and how they are not revealed until the very end of the movie.  The film's location is great, and authentic as this reviewer has visited many of the locations in Rome that featured in the movie.  The language is also good, as the locals talk in Italian, and when speaking English, do so with Italian accents.  All in all, one of the better movies of 2009.  It would surely have done better at the box office if not for the proximate releases of other blockbusters such as X-Men Origins two weeks before, Star Trek a week before, and Up 2 weeks after the May 15th opening date of Angels and Demons.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>A sequel to the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons stands up well.  You do not need to see the previous film to enjoy this one.  A few passing references are made, but nothing important.  A good cast, and another good Catholic conspiracy keep this movie moving along at a fast clip.  I enjoyed the ending because it swerved several times when I was certain of one ending or another.  A fine thriller and not much Catholic bashing.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's far fetched but it's entertaining and suspenseful in some scenes. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I don't want to watch it the second time though.<br /><br />I've never read the book this movie was based on. I'll try to read it later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>Firstly, this is a review of "Angels and Demons", the single-disc theatrical edition. The rating on this movie is PG-13, distributed by Sony Home Entertainment (2009). The extras included are:<br /><br />"Rome Was Not Built in a Day" (17:30) - this featurette covers the amazing effort that was put into recreating the Vatican, St. Peter's Square, the Sistine Chapel, and all the other landmarks in Rome. Lots of interesting information regarding set design.<br /><br />"Writing Angels and Demons" (10:00) - this segment deals with the actual adaptation of Dan Brown's novel from print to screen, and the resulting changes.<br /><br />"Characters in Search of the True Story" (17:00) - this examines the major players in the movie, and includes interviews with cast members.<br /><br />"Cern: Pushing the Boundaries of Knowledge" - here, director Ron Howard visits the Cern Super Collider and viewers get to 'see' what the facility is about.<br /><br />There's also the A&D soundtrack info and movie previews of "Julie and Julia", "2012", "The Maiden Heist", "An Education", "Year One", and "The Da Vinci Code".<br /><br />Subtitles are in English and French.<br /><br />Movie Review<br /><br />The movie diverges from the book quite a bit, enough I think to annoy ardent fans of the book. Though I enjoyed both the DVC and A&D, I also enjoyed both movie versions. I think in A&D, the essence of the story was preserved, and so I have no major grouses with the movie adaptation. The main theme explored in A&D is the perennial battle between religion and science. A canister containing anti-matter (and highly volatile at that) is stolen from a super collider facility where scientist Vittoria Vetra is working (played by Ayelet Zurer). Meanwhile, in Vatican City, the Pope dies, presumably from a stroke and the College of Cardinals gather in Conclave to elect the new Pope. Things become complicated when four of the Cardinals (who also happen to be prime choices for the Papacy) are kidnapped. Here is where our beloved symbologist comes in - Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, looking a lot better than in DVC, and also with a better hairdo) is roped in by the Vatican to investigate some mysterious symbols that point to an ancient foe of the Vatican, the Illuminati. Soon enough, both Langdon and Vittoria find themselves trying to desperately unravel the clues so that they can help save the kidnapped cardinals. They find obstacles in the form of a taciturn head of the Swiss guard , Commander Richter (played by Stellan Skarsgard), and things are also made difficult by Vatican politics, embodied in the tension between the deceased Pope's Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl).<br /><br />The acting was well-done by all accounts in this movie - due to the fast pace, there really is no in-depth character development. Hanks plays a credible slueth/symbologist and though his miraculous 'saves' defy credibility at times, he puts on a credible performance for the most part. Ms. Zurer is also suitably intelligent in her role as the scientist, and Skarsgard puts on a good performance as the enigmatic commander of the Swiss Guard. Both McGregor and Mueller-Stahl are wonderful as always, and I thought McGregor's role was the most well fleshed out in this movie.<br /><br />So, in the final analysis - this is an enjoyable thriller with plenty of twists and will please fans of the genre. It is not altogether faithful to the book, but it does retain its essence. The cinematography is exquisite - the glorious wonders of Rome's architecture is a delight to watch on-screen, and the score suits the religious themes in the movie quite well.

He has been told a mysterious cabal has kidnapped four Cardinals and they are threatening to kill, one an hour, unless their demands are met. Langdon being a symbologist has been requested to locate and free the Cardinals before it's too late. But what is it that they forgot to tell Langdon?<br /><br />I will not go through the whole story as the bulk of the movie is the surprises that you find as the story unfolds. You will also find you have fun kibitzing with don't go here don't look there.<br /><br />The movie itself makes a good sequel to the da Vinci code and the characters stay true to form. However, it is too bad if you read the book first as you will find this Langdon is more subdued, and many books characters combined are eliminated for brevity sake.<br /><br />Although this is an excellent movie and brings up many thoughts and subjects on religion and science, it is still watered down compared to the book. We also find that even though Robert Langdon is in the driver's seat what  we miss is the "constantly coming back from the dead" Robert Langdon of the book. In his attempt to make this, a more plausible story Ron Howard has turned Robert Langdon into just another symbologist when he could have been more of an Indiana Jones.<br /><br />One of my favorite characters in the movie is Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino), he has a great attitude and some good one-liners.<br /><br />I have only seen the Blu-Ray edition so I cannot compare against the other additions. Nevertheless, be sure to watch the added DVD extras. Some of the extras overlap each other but are still worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Angels and Demons is the second of Dan Brown's books to hit the big screen. This time Professor Langdon is called to the Vatican to investigate the resurgence of the mysterious Illuminati; a Catholic faction that opposed the Church's persecution of scientists during the Scientific Revolution, and was crushed as a result.<br />Tom Hanks does a great job in his respective role (as he always does), however, the rest of the cast's performance (including Ewan McGregor's) is nothing to write home about, especially Ayelet Zurer who seemed very much out of place (and was rather annoying too). Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, the action, and the music are quite decent.<br />In short, though not a masterpiece, the film will provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>More action and excitement than Da Vinci Code which is more than I expected... Doesnt tie the last movie in which is nice. The name I found misleading so I skipped this movie at the theater. What the title does infer is the relation to righteous and evil / good and bad .. therefore Angel or Demon. Very good flick!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Angels & Demons" is the sequel to "The Da Vinci Code" and stars Tom Hanks reprising his role as symbologist Robert Langdon.  As the film opens, the Pope has died.  Before the Conclave of Cardinals can assemble to select a new Pope, the preferitti, the four leading contenders for the position, are kidnapped.  A threat of their assassination as well as the total destruction of the Vatican City is made, and a mysterious symbol is found.  Langdon is summoned to the Vatican and determines that the kidnapping is the work of the Illuminati, a centuries-old deadly secret society.<br /> "Angels & Demons" is filled with red herrings, some obvious, others that come as a surprise.  Director Ron Howard keeps us guessing as a literal bomb ticks away and the lives of four cardinals hang in the balance.  There are several strong supporting performances. Ewan McGregor plays Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the man in charge of the Vatican during the transitional period between the death of one Pope and the election of the next.  Stellen Skarsgard plays the head of the Swiss Guard, the Pope's personal security staff.  Armin Mueller-Stahl portrays the elector in the Conclave of Cardinals.<br /> Author Dan Brown's formula -- creating maze-like mysteries in the milieu of the Catholic Church -- allows him to combine murder with clouded motives and Church history to elevate what would otherwise be fairly ordinary whodunits.  "Angels & Demons" is a stylish film directed with care by Mr. Howard, who understands the importance of good casting in making a movie click.<br /> "Angels & Demons" is available in three editions: single-disc DVD, two-disc DVD, and two-disc Blu-ray.  The two-disc DVD edition's bonus extras include the featurette "Handling Props," in which the filmmakers discuss bringing the props from Dan Brown's book to life; and "Angels & Demons: The Full Story," a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.  The Blu-ray edition contains these extras as well as both the theatrical and extended film versions; "The Path of Illumination," which follows Robert Langdon's path through Rome; "Movie IQ," containing loads of production facts, cast and crew details, and music and soundtrack info; and a digital copy of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>I had not read the book and approached the movie with no preconceived notions about it; I just wanted to watch it and see what it was all about and if it was worth the time. My verdict is it was definitely worth the time and provided continuous action that kept my attention all the way to an ending that was a total surprise.<br /><br />If you are an action movie fan this one should not disappoint you; there was always something happening with plenty of unexpected developments that keeps one guessing what will happen next.<br /><br />I recommend the movie and found it thoroughly entertaining. If you can just go with the flow you should find it an enjoyable ride.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I want to start off by saying that I haven't read any of Dan Brown's books.  There was a lot of hype and controversy surrounding the Da Vinci Code book and movie, and to be honest with you, after seeing the moving I was disappointed and just didn't get all the hype.  The movie just didn't intrigue me.<br /><br />Angels and Demons on the other hand surprised me.  I watched the movie with low expectations, thinking it was just going to be more of the same, but it wasn't.<br /><br />There was much more action and suspense, and the movie moved along quickly.  Also, the locations and photography were stunning, and as much a part of the film as the actors were.<br /><br />To sum it up, this film redeemed the first film, the characters, and the story.  An enjoyable movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>I know that millions of people read the novel and many of us felt cheated and manipulated throughout that book. The silly concept of the "speed plane" that flies from Boston to Geneva in like 4 hours warns the reader that the book is going to be VERY dumb. I can honestly say that this movie is better than the book and in fact is a decent action movie. Ron Howard thankfully cut the silly airplane part and removed the sexual tension between the "bad guy and the girl", which was also silly and unnecessary in the book. Also, a character who dies in the book surives in the film and I think that change gives the viewer more hope and encouragement for a positive outcome while still being suspenseful. Han Zimmer's amazing score and some stunning cinematography make this movie worth seeing, despite the far-fetched plot. Truly, this is one of the very few moments when I can say that the film is much better than the book and not the other way around.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The *only* people who should be watching Angels & Demons are those who actually understand and follow the Pope, the Illuminati, the Cardinals and everything else associated with the Vatican City because if you DON'T follow any of these events, I can promise you- you WILL be completely lost and uninterested.<br /><br />Such as the case with me unfortunately. Being a non-religious person nor someone who follows the Pope or the religious history connected to the events portrayed in the film (whether fictional or not, it doesn't matter) I wasn't able to comprehend a single thing concerning any of the stuff presented in Angels & Demons so as you can probably imagine, I was completely confused and unsatisfied.<br /><br />The second half of the film is devoted to quite a bit of action and suspense, however not being able to even remotely understand the storyline makes all that action and suspense completely ineffective and almost comical for unintentional reasons. Comical because there's no reason someone like me should be watching it.<br /><br />You're probably asking yourself "Why bother writing a review for a movie you didn't get?" and the reason is very simple. Let me explain.<br /><br />It would be completely ignorant for me to give Angels & Demons a low rating just because I wasn't able to understand any of it. However I believe it's important for me to write a review for those out there reading who might be leaning on the fence deciding whether to see this film or wondering whether it will just be a giant bundle of confusion. I can say with certainty- yes, it *will* be confusing.<br /><br />I can almost guarantee those who don't know the history of the Pope or his religion -nor those who keep themselves up to date with the Vatican City events- won't be able to grasp the storyline. Even in the film they say there's over 1 billion Catholics. That means there's 7 billion who aren't, which definitely increases the chances of more people not getting it compared to those who do.<br /><br />Obviously not all 7 billion people on the planet will have access to this film, but that's beside the point. Angels & Demons is designed for those who follow and get the plot, which is a minority.  The description did not warn me about this.<br /><br />As for Tom Hanks, his acting skills are right on the money like always. However I prefer the easily understandable storylines he's starred in over the years such as Forrest Gump or Castaway.<br /><br />You've been warned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This was marketed as a sequel even though the book itself is actually a prequel to Davinci Code. No matter, in either instance, that isn't really important; just a side note. Another side note: I despised Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon in The Davinci Code, and my feelings have not changed regarding Angels and Demons. He is terrible for the role. But at least they fixed his hair this time around...<br /><br />As for the film itself, well, it is engaging and fast-paced. It almost never lags and gets to the point quickly without little confusion. It does help if you've read the book but it really isn't necessary. The film keeps viewers guessing and hopefully the twist entertains and surprises, as it does in the book. The visuals are quite lovely to look at and the backstory behind what goes on inside the Vatican when a Pope is being replaced is quite interesting. This movie succeeds as a mystery thriller. It has its flaws of course, but it really is a fun movie experience overall.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor is quite good in this, as usual and you can thankfully ignore Hanks when they are onscreen together.<br /><br />Overall, I was skeptical after The Davinci Code, but was glad I watched this afterwards. It easily surpasses that film in pace, acting, suspense and plot. Skip that one and see Angels and Demons instead. I'd give it a solid 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>The blu ray played great. I'm not a blu ray fan.

Can Ron Howard make a riveting movie?  Absolutely.  And does Howard wisely bypass some of the hysterical physical antics Dan Brown makes Harvard Symbologist Robert Langdon suffer through in his nonsensical <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416578749">novel</a>?  Gratefully, yes.  But alas, is the plot just as farfetched, just as out of control, and the ending just as plain numb dumb silly as Mr. Brown's tome?  Unfortunately, yes.  Which makes ANGELS & DEMONS one thrilling ride, but overall it's as lame as a pack mule swimming a mill pond.<br /><br />We're all familiar with the story; suffice it to say Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks, reprising his role from 'The DaVinci Code'), accompanied by his appealing compadre Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer), rushes breathlessly from one Roman locale to another to prevent the murders of four cardinals who are in line to succeed the just-departed Pope; meanwhile a canister of antimatter must be found before it obliterates all of Vatican City.  And who, pray tell, initiated all of this chaos?  The Illuminati!  &lt;&lt;Shudder.>>  Only was it truly the Illuminati, or a desperate plot inside the Vatican to make Catholicism--and religion in general--more essential to mankind?  Only Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (a confused-looking Ewan McGregor) can answer that! This is a movie that rushes at breakneck speed from one depiction of carnage to another until the over-the-top ending has us chuckling under our breaths.  Yes, ANGELS & DEMONS is darn fun to watch, but it's as silly as The Three Stooges in hemp-colored vestments.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>Very briefly, I would like to begin by addressing some of the criticism concerning  this movie.<br /><br />Some are unhappy because the movie does not closely follow the book. This happens to be true but how many book-based movies do? For the sake of movie-making, Dan Brown's book was not followed to the letter or even closely. However, it may be worth knowing that Dan Brown was the movie's executive producer and he absolutely approved all the major plot changes. If fact, he confesses to actually suggesting some of the major changes. Perhaps those who read the book should treat the movie as work 'related' to the book but not THE book illustrated. It's still Dan Brown's work but this is cinematography that was inspired by his book, to be appreciated and enjoyed as a movie.<br /><br />I heard statements that the book was somehow anti-Christian or anti-Catholic. I disagree. I will not reveal the plot by providing substantial details but the movie concludes in a way that suggests respect for religious faith and the Catholic church, in fact, comes out looking pretty good.<br /><br />Angels & Demons besides being a feast to the eyes, it succeeds in arousing the viewer's curiosity in more than one area: contemporary physics, Rome's landmarks, the Vatican. And those who watched the movie and may find themselves in Rome and at the Vatican are more likely than not to actually look for some of the landmarks featured in Angels & Demons. In fairness, Angels & Demons does not come close to The DaVinci Code's Earth-shattering scope, depth of research and sophistication but it's still unmistakenly Dan Brown and those who enjoyed the Code will probably love A&D. Those who hated the Code are likely to hate A&D more. To me, Dan Brown's works are not art and they aren't science but they are great, well researched entertainment that often challenge the reader's/viewer's preconceived opinions and stimulate further research and investigation - and this is a good thing.<br /><br />When it comes to acting Tom Hanks does not disappoint as Robert Langdon but Ewan McGregor lacks the gravitas we would expect from an acting Pope. All others are up to the job but I didn't see any Oscar-quality performances and didn't expect to.<br /><br />The special effects - when it comes to the recreation of St. Peter Square and parts of the Vatican - are nothing short of amazing. Like I said, the movie is a feast to the eyes and, for all intents and purposes, what you see is always Rome and the Vatican, even when the cameras were filming some California parking lot.<br /><br />PACKAGING AND PRESENTATION<br /><br />Sony is totally throwing the kitchen sink at us with this Blu edition. As the Blu standard bearer and main promoter, they want to show us what Blu can do to make our lives a little more interesting. Everything that you can think of when you think Blu-ray and more 'is in there'.<br /><br />Everything is good quality, starting with the Blu case which is not the cheap, perforated, almost falling apart kind that some of the lesser editions are using these days.<br /><br />The decision to include both the theatrical version AND the extended cut on the same disc is responsible for this being a 3-disc set with a second disk carrying the special features and a third dedicated to the digital copies.<br /><br />Technically speaking, the picture is, of course, a sharp 1080p and the two available sound tracks are both DTS-HD Master Audio in English and French. Surprisingly, the bonus features are shot in high-def as well with 2.0 stereo for the soundtrack.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES - BLU-RAY<br /><br />Besides BD-Live, a number of interesting Blu-specific features are available with this release.<br /><br />The Path of Illumination emulates a trail through Rome, following Robert Langdon's through 5 Roman landmarks. It has high visuals, interviews, footage from each location, even a dictionary where dozens of terms are explained. Anyone passing through Rome could walk the path with the Path of Illumination feature serving as a travel guide.<br /><br />CineChat is another Sony attempt to promote more interactivity. It allows those watching the movie to organize themselves into a viewing party and actually have their chats displayed on-screen as the movie is playing.<br /><br />The movieIQ option is a BD-Live powered option. It logs into and checks some online database and provides up-to-date information about the movie and specific chapters while watching the movie. Pretty cool actually and not over-distracting, especially considering that this is not information 'burned' into the disc and it is updated, at least in theory if not in practice.<br /><br />The digital copy, if this can go under Blu-ray specific features, is available for the PC, PSP (via PS3), Mac and iPod. Expires on 2/12/2010.<br /><br />THE OTHER EXTRAS<br /><br />Not as interactive as the BD-specific ones, they are also shot in hi-def for the Blu version, there are lots of shorts about the 'making of', actors, special effects, as expected. The featurette titled 'Writing Angels & Demons' should be of special interest because it's there where Dan Brown confesses to his specific agreement and cooperation on altering the story. Another interesting extra is on the CERN. Finally, we actually get to see and hear the real-life John Langdon, the person who served as the inspiration for the Robert Langdon character - he specializes in 'ambiagrams', of course.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I found this movie to be entertaining and to carry sufficient 'substance' to merit watching maybe more than once. The quality of the Blu rendition is nothing short of exquisite and the extras, both Blu-specific and the regular ones are worth watching and interacting with.<br /><br />Angels & Demons is a keeper and, as a work of entertainment, it's a 5-star in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Not that the first film was a classic or anything, but it was still mildly interesting. This film begins well, but then devolves into a ridiculous pseudo-mystery and becomes tedious as it goes on.<br /><br />This is Ron Howard and Tom Hanks in need of a hefty paycheck, and nothing more. Hanks' Langdon is a bore, devoid of any detectable human emotion.<br /><br />This franchise needs to end.</p></br><a href="../users/A35AMPDFAB8JLT.html">A35AMPDFAB8JLT</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's new film is set mainly in Rome. However, the movie starts off at CERN, which is the largest particle accelerator in the world located in the suburbs of Geneva on the Franco-Swiss boarder. Anti-matter is stolen from facility which will supposedly blow up once the batteries of its container die out. In real life, over ten years, the facility has only made enough anti-matter to light a light bulb for about three minutes. So as long as we remain ignorant of this little detail we're in for a bit of a heart pumping ride, sort of. This film looks great, but it becomes a bit tiresome as the cops, and Tom Hank's character (Robert Langdon), are always just a little late in the pursuit of the killer. And unfortunately, the danger doesn't seem so much for them, as for the Cardinals, who we are never made to empathize with anyhow. This may be the real flaw of the movie. If there was more inherent danger to Robert, or those close to him, then this film might actually be suspenseful. When the killer does meet Robert head on, in a basement, the killer simply says that his business is not with Robert, as long as Robert doesn't pursue him. That's a sure way to deflate any suspense from a movie! If it wasn't for the great scenery and wonderful direction it doesn't seem like there would actually be too much here to rave about. The movie feels contrived, and silly, with its treasure chest like chase around Rome after an anonymous killer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Dan Brown's controversial novel "The Da Vinci Code" was a best seller and the film adaptation of the film was box office gold as the film grossed over $758 million worldwide.  Needless to say, controversy helped catapult this film and the novel and it was no surprise when it was announced that Ron Howard ("A Beautiful Mind", "Frost/Nixon", "Cinderella Man", "Apollo 13') would return as director and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump", "Castaway", "Big", "Sleepless in Seattle", "Saving Private Ryan")  as the main character Robert Langdon in an adaptation of Dan Brown's 2000 mystery-thriller novel "Angels & Demons".<br /><br />The film would feature a screenplay by David Koepp ("Hack", "War of the Worlds", "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", "Ghost Town") and Akiva Goldsman ("I Am Legend", "I Robot", "Cinderella Man").  Music for the film is by Hans Zimmer ("Frost/Nixon", "The Dark Knight", "Kung Fu Panda", "Pirates of the Carribean" films) and cinematography by Salvatore Totino ("Cinderella Man", "Changing Lanes", "Frost/Nixon").  The film The film opened in May 2009 and like "That Da Vinci Code", received a lot of controversy and did well in the box office as "Angels & Demons" made over $485 million.<br /><br />Now "Angels & Demons" receives its entry to High Definition with a two-disc Blu-ray release which includes the theatrical and extended edition version of the film plus a third disc which contains a digital copy of the movie.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Angels & Demons" is featured in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1).  The film looks absolutely stunning on Blu-ray.  Salvatore Totino and Ron Howard make a great filmmaking couple as the Director has trusted Totino to capture the setting in Rome and its people with clarity, amazing detail of the various architecture and the surrounds outside the Vatican.  And of course, the skin pores and detail on the characters face.  It's all captured quite well and to add to that, a nice fine layer of grain.  Overall, picture quality is fantastic.<br /><br />And as for audio quality, the film is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Unlike "The Da Vinci Code", "Angels & Demons" is a film that features a lot of action scenes (which either is going to make you feel its going a bit too farfetched or will make you feel that it's wonderful).  From the gunshots from the assassin, the helicopter overhead, the cars racing and of course the anti-matter scenes, there is a good use of audio because of those action sequences.  But what about the ambiance of a crowded area of the Vatican.  Yes, you can hear the crowds with clarity and you can hear the people in the Vatican chit chatting, it's a wonderful use of the soundscape.  But the main thing that you will notice right off the bat is Hans Zimmer's music.  The music plays a big part of the "Angels & Demons" in creating that feel of action, sadness or the key dramatic moments.  Overall, this is another lossless soundtrack that really utilizes audio completely well.  It's not a full-on action-based film but it's a film that does sound remarkably well.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Angel & Demons" has a second Blu-ray disc primarily for the special features.  The special features are all in High Definition, in English (Stereo) and also has English subtitles.

Choose church and you will see footage of the church and commentary by Ron Howard explaining the history of that location or structures.  Also, read information and detail of other subjects as well.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"Angels & Demons" is one of those films that you either love or hate, as the same situation with "The Da Vinci Code".<br /><br />I found the film to be quite entertaining and the cinematography and music to really enhance the film because the biggest problem that I found was the overuse of CG.  I know the goal was to show how religion and science can work together but I tend to have a disdain towards films that try to be real but overuse CG in ways that are a bit farfetched.<br /><br />Also, there was a problem with character development.  In "The Da Vinci Code", there were characters that you actually cared about.  With "Angels & Demons", I could hardly care for the Dr. Vetra because she's hardly around Robert for most of the film.  That's what I enjoyed about the last film, the characters of Audrey Tautou's Agent Sophie Neveu and Dr. Robert Langdon developed well over the course of the film, while in "Angels & Demons"...somehow the symbiologist ends up becoming an action-hero, escaping major predicaments, one after the other and it was one thing to see it happen but seeing him do it over and over again, was a bit too farfetched for my taste.  I wanted to see more of that intelligence and knowledge in symbiology and history to play a big part of the film.<br /><br />But the saving grace for this film was my appreciation of "Angels & Demons" cinematography and music.  Similar to how Jacques Tati made the city come alive in a film like "Playtime", Rome was captured as is.  No matter how many people were loitering near the set, director Ron Howard wanted to capture the city and its beauty and they succeeded.<br /><br />This is definitely a beautiful film and the Blu-ray release definitely brings out the film's detail and clarity.  I was quite impressed with the picture quality, although the CG was just a bit too out-of-place it seemed.  But the overall locations of where the film was shot and the creating of the sets to make the film come alive and make a set in Los Angeles look like Rome, a job well done by the production department.<br /><br />And the lossless soundtrack is solid as well.  Special features wise, "The Da Vinci Code" was packed with bonus features but "Angels & Demons" had about seven major features and no commentary track by Ron Howard either.  But I did enjoy the use of "The Path of the Illumination" featuring the various areas around Rome.<br /><br />Overall, "Angels & Demons" is an entertaining film, it's an ambitious and beautiful looking film that looks and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray.  But the film does have its shortcomings and some scenes are a bit farfetched, but yet in the end, I found the overall content and presentation of "Angels & Demons" on Blu-ray to be quite fascinating and entertaining and feel it is definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I was shocked by the incredibly stupid and convoluted plot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4TE">Angels & Demons</a> - even worse than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOC9">The Da Vinci Code</a>. While I understand Dan Brown's stories are works of fiction, this just goes too far into the realm of unbelievability. It seems ass if one man was able to launch an entire conspiracy against the papal leadership, kill dozens of cops, and kidnap four cardinals with minimal help. Professor Robert Langdon, the protagonist, is able to draw connections between vague clues and never seems to get shot (even when the bad guy sees him, he refuses to shoot Langdon). Meanwhile, the whole bomb plot revolves around an antimatter device developed by Vatican scientists - technology far out of the reach of modern science, much less a few Vatican scientists. Even at the end, I couldn't figure out what was going on. There were so many loose ends that I was convinced the movie was made by a bunch of amateurs rather than a highly paid Hollywood scriptwriting team.<br /><br />As with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOC9">The Da Vinci Code</a>, the acting in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4TE">Angels & Demons</a> was pretty decent, particularly the supporting cast. Ewan McGregor stole quite a bit of the movie as a senior papal official. However, Tom Hanks as Professor Langdon was pretty forgettable as he was almost like a robot - always right, always the smartest guy in the room. Dr. Vitra was also almost a non-entity in the film rather than a co-star.<br /><br />I would warn anybody who is somewhat sensitive that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4TE">Angels & Demons</a> seems to delight in portraying gruesome deaths. In addition to your garden variety shootings, the film contains rats eating a dead man and several other set ablaze.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SINGLE DISC BLU-RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />There's probably millions of physicists, theologians and hugely academic types out there who can't wait to poo poo "Angels & Demons" - the sequel to Dan Brown's ludicrously successful book and movie - "The Da Vinci Code" - I'm not going to be one of them.<br /><br />While you wouldn't call it a "Bourne-like" masterpiece in terms of non-stop plot and thrills, A&D gets damn close - and almost all of the time. Sequel or stand alone - it's a brilliantly executed movie - and far, far better than its predecessor ever was, entertaining the weary pants off of you with real style, skill and panache.<br /><br />To start with - "Angels & Demons" has the magic triple whammy - a really great cast who can bring gravitas to any part they play, a fantastically well-adapted screenplay from great source material (AKIVA GOLDSMAN and DAVID KOEPP who are both Oscar winners and nominees) and the best entertainment Director in the movie business today - RON HOWARD. I mean the guy just delivers time after time after time - "Frost/Nixon", "Cinderella Man" and "Apollo 13" are among his superb former credits.<br /><br />It goes like this (and every word of the following is Gospel)... There's a plot to bring down the Catholic Church and replace it with an order based on science rather than faith, which may or may not have something to do with the ancient and mysterious cult of THE ILLUMINATI. Despite being purged centuries back by scared zealots in the Catholic Church, these are powerful people still in high places who have remained undetected down through the ages by the modern world - patiently waiting for their time of revenge. And an experiment in Switzerland has given them that chance.<br /><br />TOM HANKS is back as the permanently po-faced Professor Langdon summoned by a devout priest (EWAN McGREGOR) to the holy city of the Vatican in Rome to protect the Catholic Church at a time of Papal re-election. A slick assassin who is prepared to carry out grizzly acts of torture (played chillingly by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS) is killing off high-ranking Catholic cardinals in a countdown to an apocalyptical 'light' that will consume the throne of Christ's church on Earth. And wouldn't you know it, but poor old butter-brains Langdon has only 4 hours to work it all out and stop the end of...well the world frankly... Luckily he is ably aided by a particle-analyst in the shape of the leggy AYELET ZURER (it's a scientific fact that all lab scientists look like this woman - I swear). And on it goes....<br /><br />It's all utter knob of course, but the historical linking of actual statues, churches and symbols all over the city make you believe every cleverly preposterous word of it. Throw in the brilliance of actors like ARMIN-MUELLER-STALH as a Cardinal who may become the next Fisherman and STELLAN SKARSGARD as the head of the Vatican Police who trusts no-one including his employers - and you have enough diversions, red herrings and word-like genius to make the men who make up the British Government's balance of payments forecasts positively blush with envy. It's brilliant stuff - it really is - and every scene is filled with it.<br /><br />The locations and sets are all ace too - the catacombs under the streets, the reproduced airtight Vatican Archives and the ornate rooms in sumptuous buildings - all of it helps the stunning look the movie has - and the BLU RAY picture (no pun intended) is immaculate throughout. The extras are extensive and add to the experience nicely (an impressive amount of effort was involved) and the extended cut is included.<br /><br />So there you have it. Whether or not you consider all organised religion to be a corrupting force or the very bedrock on which civilized society is based is not going to get talked about too much in "Angels & Demons" - it's far too busy trying to entertain you for all that stuff 'n nonsense... But you are more likely than you would think to get up out of your comfy chair, brush the crisps and curry off your faded Metallica teeshirt and say, "Well, bugger me sideways with a can-opener from Mars...but that was damn good!"</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>While the faithful await the election of a new pope, symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and a beautiful physicist (Ayelet Zurer) follow the trail of the Illuminati, who have abducted the most likely papal candidates and threaten to destroy Vatican City in a blaze of anti-matter in retaliation for the persecution of Galileo and other scientists.<br /><br />This film features a few nail-biting scenes, so it is not as boring as its predecessor.  However, it's still just a bit too neat the way Langdon is able to follow the trail of hidden clues and it's unclear why the villains would provide such clues in the first place.  Oh, wait, that's right...without them, there would be no movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Angels and Demons(released May/09)brings to the screen yet another Dan Brown novel of the same name.Like its' predecessor(The Da Vinci Code)Brown throws together a mixture of historical fact,conjecture and mythos to bring to vivid life another story involving the Church,its' past and it's atonement for past sins.Unlike the former movie,this film is almost apologetic in its' tone at times,especially near the end giving the viewer a more even approach to the subject matter.It also has a different focus than Da Vinci.<br />The story here involves the return of the Illuminati.This was a group formed as far back as the 8th century but in the 1500s included many scientists(Galileo was reputedly a member)and intellectuals who thought the Church's dogma and control of science and scientific ideas was flawed and wrong.The Church in response publicly killed four of its more prominent members and now the Illuminati,it would seem,is out for revenge.Their target is the LHC(Large Hadron Collider) in Switzerland where anti-matter has been produced and subsequently stolen by them.At this same time the Pope has died and a new one has yet to be voted into office.Carmelengo McKenna(Ewan McGregor)is the person officially in charge until a new pope is elected and he is overseeing the Cardinals all being sequestered to vote a new Pope in.Before they can go into conclave four of the Cardinals up for election are kidnapped by members of the Illuminati.The Vatican sends one of its' security team to the US to find Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks)to assist in finding the captured Cardinals.<br />There is a serious twist involved in the Cardinals rescue.Each one will be executed on the hour starting at 8PM and at 12AM the missing anti-matter will explode killing thousands of Vatican citizens and visitors.Langdon is introduced to the head of the Swiss Guard who is directly responsible for the Pope and Vatican security,Commander Richter(Stellan Skarsgard).He is very much aware of Langdon and his work and two consistently butt heads as the investigation takes them on a windy path.Langdon finally latches on to the first clue and they travel the city from one end to the other trying to locate where the bomb and Cardinals are located.Langdon is even given access to ancient Vatican archives which helps them to narrow the search area.Three Cardinals are unfortunately killed as the police and Langdon arrive just a little too late,but ever so closer with each point searched.The final Cardinal to be executed winds up in a deep fountain which Langdon witnesses;tied and weighed down by weights on a trolley.Calling for help Langdon finally manages to rescue the Cardinal and learn the whereabouts of the bomb/antimatter.<br />The bomb is located right below the modern Vatican in the Necropolis,the foundation of the modern Church where St Peter himself was executed,upside down.Langdon and the police race back.In the meantime Commander Richter has confronted the Carmelengo in his office,alone.When screams are heard the security force breaks in to find Richter standing menacingly over the Carmelego who is shouting he is the one and has a gun(pointing to Richter).Richter is shot as another papal official comes running in also bent on doing the prostrate Carmelengo in.He is also shot.There is no time to think or act as all race down to the Necropolis and finally find the vile of antimatter.They are unable to change its batteries which would have enabled safe transport back to Switzerland,so in an apparent act of selfishness and higher calling the Carmelengo takes the vile and flies with it(in a helicopter)straight up as far as it will go and out of harms way.All watch the helicopter go out of sight then a glimpse of a descending parachute,just as the explosion occurs.All in the square are knocked to the ground and as the blast wave subsides the Carmelengo comes drifting in unconscious to the ground.<br />While the Carmelengo is being tended to by medical personnel Langdon makes a discovery on Richter's security video.The real truth comes out that the Carmelengo staged the entire Illuminati threat himself.Richter confronted him with the truth and unfortunately the unsuspecting security men had no idea what the real situation was and shot him and the other papal employee by mistake.The video was brought to the attention of the sequestered Cardinals and the Carmelengo was summoned to account for his actions.The Carmelengo was cornered as he tried to leave the Vatican and killed himself in a horrible fiery death.As Langdon leaves he gets a thank you from Church officials,the newly elected Pope(the cardinal he managed to save) and an ancient booklet of which he had repeatedly asked for but had been denied.<br />I found this movie a little less engaging than the first one.The acting throughout is great but the premise hasn't got the bite of the first one.The first movie was full of Vatican complicity and intrigues dating back to the origins of the Church itself and doesn't make apologies for its stance.This film seems to be making amends for the first and the controversy it created...big time.Sometimes the script even sounds as if members of the Church themselves wrote it,as near the end when Langdon is told that the Church is flawed because it is run by men,who are also flawed.And the Carmelengo is given several good lines regarding the Church,its' good intentions and deeds.This has the effect of rendering the scripts bite down to a slight scratch at times.It also makes the movies center shift away from possible Vatican complicity in shadowy undertakings to focusing more on the Langdon angle and his amazing abilities to unveil the clues for the race against time to save the Cardinals and the Vatican itself.Much different from the first film which was what made it the huge success it was.<br />Technically the movie has been transferred wonderfully as is the sound.It is in its 2:40:1 aspect ratio.The 2 DVD set extras include the featurettes:"Rome wasn't built in a day","Writing Angels and Demons","Characters in search of the true story",the story of the LHC,"Handling props",a look behind the scenes of the movie,and a interview with the real John Langdon.Impressive extras they are.<br />In conclusion I do recommend this film to all.If you liked the Da Vinci Code you will like this one but be warned in the end the tack that has been taken in this film plot is quite different from the first.Vatican complicities and wrongdoings are not so much the focus this time,as is the hunt to find the truth instead.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>It is most important I start writing this review by stating that I do not read Dan Brown's books.  I saw film "Da Vinci Code" and was suprised that most viewers were commenting on Tom Hunks' haircut.  This time around his haircut is in much better shape.  Also this film is set in Vatican and Rome and many of the beauties of the area make film so much more appealing to the audiences.  Premise is interesting - scientists in Cern, Geneva are searching for the antimatter.  If proven to exist, this will be a basic particle from which universe was created.  Is it possible to reconcile this scientific "proof" (in real life anti-matter is not discovered yet) with the old traditions of christian faith (Catholic faith in particular).<br /><br />The inconvenience of the situation is that the pope has died and the new pope is not selected yet.  In a situation where there is no appointed leader of the 1 billion faithful Catholics around the world, power struggle is imminent between Vatican's police, security and priests placed in temporary power of the Holy Seat.  I loved the beauty of the city of Rome with its architectural delights and catacombs.  If not taken too seriously, this is a cool thriller to watch on one's night off.</p></br><a href="../users/AH1OH4PWR7NV6.html">AH1OH4PWR7NV6</a><br/><p>This movie was a bit long but ok.  Maybe I was not impressed with this movie because I read the book.  Rent it first and add your own opion.  I wish I had rented it first.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>I just didn't find this movie all that interesting. It just wasn't exciting. In fact, National Treasure was better than this movie could ever hope to be!<br /><br />One man has been called in to help solve the mystery behind the kidnapping for four priets. They rush around trying to solve the mystery using clues from Catholic historical books.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Angels and Demons" is another of Dan Brown's complicated conspiracy thrillers. Not as good as "The Da Vinci Code" but along the same lines, again starring Tom Hanks as the symbologist, Robert Langdon. This time it's the death of a pope and a great deal of intrigue in the Vatican. As usual there's mumbo jumbo, hokum, hocus pocus, wild hectic headlong helter-skelter chases and quests.<br /> The movie unwinds at a fast pace so you don't have time to question the idiocies and intricacies of the convoluted plot. Even though he is hated by the Catholic Church because of his machinations in "Code," Hanks is called in because four cardinals have been kidnapped and Vatican City may be in extreme danger. He is joined by a female scientist in the case though no love interest seems to develop. She is trying to get back some highly explosive anti-matter that her lab has produced.<br /> The trail leads to a series of four churches in Rome where a missing cardinal is to be found. The trail is similar to the rose line in "Code."<br /> A secret society, the Illuminati, with moles within the Vatican itself are the culprits, and you'll probably be struck dumb when you find out what they are up to. How a person parachutes from a helicopter at the crucial moment may baffle you. The crowds in St. Peter's Square, waiting for the election of the new pope, are shown frequently. The cardinals are meeting in a consistory in the Sistine Chapel to choose a papal successor.<br /> The movie has some great shots of Rome, the Vatican, and some great reenactments of ceremonies within the Vatican. The scenes, though staged, seem very authentic.<br /> Some of the film which, at times, is difficult to follow seems more opaque and obtuse because of some severe editing. Amid the skullduggery a monsignor in a skull cap is shown very briefly, and he comes into play several times. It's very difficult to figure out what he's up to and which side he's on. It's the good guys versus the bad guys, but we're not too sure about the motives of the good guys.<br /> Tom Hanks, though in charge, sometimes acts as mystified as we are by events, but, hey, he's already read the script, hasn't he?<br /> If you're looking for an exciting thriller, this may be up your aisle, but don't look for too much clarity or common sense. It's a corkscrew of a plot with its Byzantine conspiracies running amuck and astray.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this movie, and parts of it are OK.<br /><br />As soon as this film begins, when I see the ritual of the Breaking of the Pope's Ring (which tradition the Church abandoned generations ago)...when I see the ring has the deceased pope's name as "PIUS XVI"...well, I was snickering, and it galloped off from there. We never quit snickering.<br /><br />The last real Pius was Pius XII, so I see Dan Brown exhibited his usual stupidity in this, which is his 1st terrible novel, which this is the film version of! Did he conveniently forget there should be Piuses XIII-XV first? By the bye, there is fiction and then there's sheer boneheadedness, and Brown is the poster child for victims of the latter.<br /><br />Also, I was amazed at the lack of comments about the incerdibly stupid scene of the pope's tomb being opened to check for signs of poisoning. Not only stupid, also offensive. In the past, there was at least one film I can think of that the Church went after just for its title (THE POPE MUST DIE, 1991, changed to THE POPE MUST DIET--vid. my review of it).<br /><br />In ANGELS & DEMONS, the pope's been poisoned, they desecrate his tomb (yes, it is desecration the way they do it in the movie)...then they see with their own eyes that he appears to have been murdered. Though with magical autopsy eyes they see, because only an autopsy could prove the murder. This would have normally released howls of protest from the Vatican, and the pope would certainly have anathematized this film.<br /><br />Too bad we can't anathematize for bad cinema.<br /><br />These are but a few tiny iceberg tips in what is, admittedly, a 'sorta' rousing Dumb-ass Action film. Rather clever, the whole anti-matter-Illuminati-in-the-Church business. Also, simultaneously asinine. As was much of this picturesque film--though I thought the rooms of the Swiss Guard looked rather nice and genuine. Why does this sort of thing have to be so brainless?<br /><br />The cheap mention of the "God Particle"...give me a break.<br /><br />We noticed Hanks looking browbeaten and raggedy in this film. Very likely he didn't want to do it. I did like him changing into priest's clothes which happened (miraculously) to be hanging right next to him, right when he required them. Anti-Catholic? Hell, people, this film is anti-cinema, anti-good-taste! Still, it's never anywhere near as bad as film can get, and as I said, I do kind of like watching it.<br /><br />And you know, THE DA VINCI CODE, equally dumb as it was, I actually liked a lot more because we see Langdon for the first time. He's interesting and I liked the way his thinking processes were shown. Here we get SQUAT. Perhaps it is because this film is a sequel, and is treated as such...but it is based on Brown's 1st novel. THE DA VINCI CODE is his 2nd and I hope his LAST novel....<br /><br />Amazon sells great copies of "Shoes of the Fisherman". I suggest you get it instead. If you suffered through the film version of Brown's 2nd novel ("Dan Brown Teaches You All About Mary Magdalene", wasn't that it? :0), you deserve so much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>The Jews have been a part of Rome for a long time so where would someone get the surname Galileo?  Galilee? I kept wondering while watching this solidly entertaining sequel to Da Vinci Code which was more sensationalistic.  This is a good movie with a less cute cast but with more food for thought.  I would recommend watching this movie but unlike Da Vinci Code, I have no plans to buy it.  I think the cast from the Da Vinci Code was just jazzier.  Fans of Flame and Cintron and Swedes will enjoy that two members of the Swiss Guard are played by Danish Flame and Swedish Stellan Skarsgaard aka Eric Northman's dad.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Released in 2009, 'Angels and Demons' is director Ron Howard's second cinematic installment chronicling the adventures of Harry Langdon (Tom Hanks), symbolist extraordinaire. As in the 'Da Vinci Code' the bad guy is once again ensconced within Vatican walls and protected by churchly robes akin to wolves in sheeps clothing. Do you think maybe Dan Brown has an axe to grind? Be that as it may a movie is modern storytelling and the important question is did you enjoy the tale?<br /><br />I found the film somewhat a disappointment. It was a case of alot of glitz but no substance. The production values are first rate with an accomplished cast to match and the central character Harry Langdon is more complex and fascinating than, dare I say it, Indiana Jones (did I just hear thunder from on high). Yet with that said I must also say that I never got caught up in the story. There was no emotional connection, no pounding heartbeat, no anticipation of what was going to happen next. In the final analysis I felt cheated and I'm still wondering where are the angels and demons mentioned in the title? If they had stayed with the European title, 'Illuminati' at least it would have been an honest reflection of what the film was about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>For those who hadn't read the book, this movie would be hard to understand.  In the book a lot is explained and the book flows at a good pace.  The movie crams a lot of information at you and you have Dr. Langdon off chasing clues to kidnapped Cardinals and it is difficult to follow what is going on.  The Da Vinci Code, which was an inferior book, played much better on the big screen.  There the audience was given sufficient explanation for everything and the pace was such the the human brain could easily comprehend what was happening at all times.<br /><br />Tom Hanks if back as Dr. Langdon who is asked to fly from Boston to Rome immediately because the old enemy of the church, the Illuminati has surfaced.  Additionally, the world Cardinals have convened in Rome to elect a new Pope and four of their preferred choices have been kidnapped.  Langdon learns that he has only a matter of hours to save the kidnapped Cardinals and prevent an explosion that will level the Vatican.<br /><br />The book went into fine detail as to the development of anti-matter at the CERN Institute as well as exquisite detail as to how the Vatican works when a Pope dies.  That is all absent here, instead the audience is force fed this info in a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The movie does have a lot of tense moments as Langdon races to save each of the Cardinals before they are killed.  Langdon must solve riddles (a la Da Vinci Code and National Treasure) to find where they are but where that translated well in the other movies it falls flat here.<br /><br />I did give the movie three stars because of the grand scenes we see at the Vatican and inside.  There are some tense moments too and while most of the acting is good, the character of Vittoria is nowhere as good as the female character that assisted Langdon in the prior movie.<br /><br />I recommend reading the book before you see this film so you would have too much shoved down your brain at once.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!<br /><br />Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, "24".  You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama.  If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.<br /><br />As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive "dark matter" compound.  Much like in "The DaVinci Code", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest.  However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.<br /><br />I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!<br /><br />Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read "one more chapter" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.  When looked back upon, the pieces may not fit together or even seem downright ludicrous, but it was one heck of a ride!</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Here we have the sequel to the rather mediocre film The da Vinci Code. The source material for that film was pretty weak. Angels and Demons, thankfully, has stronger source material and is, also thankfully, a far better film.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of a group of terrorists who get their hands on some anti-matter and hide it somewhere in the Vatican, promising to blow the place sky-high. They haven't any demands or anything like that. They just plan to blow it up as revenge for an act the Vatican did back in the late 1600's. The Vatican, in the midst of trying to elect a new Pope, calls in symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), to find the bomb and save the day.<br /><br />And that's pretty much it for the plot. What follows is a series of chases through Rome, searches through archives and a lot of eye-rolling on the part of the audience. Well, at least on the part of anyone who knows anything about the Illuminati (which contrary to the story, was not founded 400 years ago and which Galileo very likely did not belong to, given that it was founded over a century after his death). Also near as I'm aware the LHC does not generate anti-matter. That's not what it's built to do, and we already have other ways to make the stuff.<br /><br />But despite the large amount of eye-rolling and suspension of disbelief that's required, the film largely works. Tom Hanks does his usual good job, and the supporting cast is acceptable, if nothing to write home about. The movie also changes several of the more preposterous things from the book (we don't get the reporter subplot, and the film makes it clear that, hey, news stations actually go to places and film stories rather than standing in front of green screens, though ironically, I bet while filming the movie that's what they did), and in doing so turns it into a better story. It's still not great (but how can it be?), but it is at least entertaining.<br /><br />I don't know. There's not a lot to say about this movie, really. It was fun, it was interesting, it was entertaining and I'm sure two months down the line I'll be hard-pressed to really remember anything about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>ANGELS & DEMONS would work well as a silent movie - well, a silent movie with the musical score of Hans Zimmer in the background.  Cinematographer Salvatore Totino offers us views of Rome and  Vatican City, both from the exterior and from the historically significant interiors, that are as stunning as any on film. The actors look well and seem as involved as the creaky script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have pasted together from Dan Brown's first (in a probably endless line) novel allows about the derring-do of symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his role from The Da Vinci Code).  But while the story is interesting - illuminating the Illuminati's centuries old plight to force the Catholic church to accept scientific reasoning instead of condemning it - and while Ron Howard as director does his best to give us a fast-paced thriller, the dialogue dumbs down the audience by the simplistic, hurriedly discovered answers to the meaning of symbols that drive this story.  Dan Brown's novel gave the reader some breathing time to digest the ancient codes and incorporate them into the action: Ron Howard's film condenses the important findings in favor of emphasizing special effects and splendid footage of the inner chambers of St Peter's and the various churches that become destination points for the murders of the 'preferiti' cardinals gathered to elect a new pope after the surprise demise of the current pope.<br /><br />The cast includes some fine, interesting faces and actors - Ewan McGregor as the recently dead Pope's camerlengo, Stellan Skarsg?rd as the suspicious Commander Richter, a very beautiful but bland Ayelet Zurer as the sole female scientist Vittoria Vetra who understands the importance of rescuing the 'antimatter' that threatens the end of the church and a good part of the territory around Rome, Armin Mueller- Stahl as the crusty old Cardinal Strauss,  Pierfrancesco Favino as the Inspector Olivetti, and the always fascinating character actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas as the assassin - but Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon rattles off his obsession with ecclesiastic symbology with such speed  and nonchalance that the mysteries become almost insignificant to the audience who simply go along with the patter. It is a mad chase of a film, fortunately treating the audience to some wondrous scenery and lighting effects.  As a film it is entertaining, but then that was the purpose of the book, too.  It just feels like it not as fully realized a mystery as would be possible in different hands. Grady Harp, November 09</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>When a murder of a physicist, Leonardo Vetra, finds a symbolist, Robert Langdon, and Mr. Vetra's daughter, Vittoria, on an adventure for a secret brotherhood, The Illuminati. Clues lead them all around the Vatican, including the four alters of science, Earth, Air, Fire and Water. An Assassin, working for the Illuminati, has captured four cardinals, and murders each, painfully. Robert and Vittoria also are searching for a new very destructive weapon that could kill millions. Ron Howard and Tom Hanks have really topped The Da Vinci Code in every way possible. The heart- racing hunt through Rome to find ancient clues will blow your mind.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called to the Vatican to assist in a mystery involving the Illuminati. They were (are?) a secret society of scientists dedicated to preserving scientific truths against the Vatican's attempts to suppress them.<br /><br />Vittoria Vetra (Avelet Zurer) has been working on the Hadrian Collider, and collected the first substantial bit of antimatter. It's perfectly suspended in a magnetic bottle, but the bottle relies on batteries that must be changed every 24 hours. Frankly, I found that rather artificial aspect of the suspense a bit hard to swallow. Anyway, using a rather gruesome method, the bottle was stolen from the lab despite extremely tight security. Probably an inside job.<br /><br />Now the old pope has just died, and a conclave is called to select a new one. And during this time, an ambigram has shown up with the name "Illuminati." An ambigram is a neat bit of graphic art that reads the same upside down and right side up. There was a "legend," according to Langdon, of four brands for earth, air, fire and water which were all done in ambigrams. One cannot help trying to figure how they were done hundreds of years before the sophisticated computer software necessary to create them today.<br /><br />So why was Langdon called to the Vatican? Because four cardinals have been kidnapped, the four most likely to be chosen as Pope. A message is received from the Illuminati (or someone claiming to be them) that one of them will be killed at 8 pm, 9, 10 and 11, and the Vatican will be blown up at midnight. Langdon has written part one of his study of the Illuminati, and can be acknowledged as an expert on them. But he has been petitioning for some ten years to gain access to the Vatican archives so he can complete the second volume.<br /><br />So, the Cardinals, minus the four kidnapped favorites, have been locked in the Sistine Chapel by the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), who was the dead pope's closest assistant and acts on behalf of the papacy itself until a new pope is chosen. He is thus available to help the Swiss Guard, the Vatican police, Langdon and Vetra to search for the kidnapped cardinals and ultimately the canister of antimatter.<br /><br />There. I've set it up for you. There is much racing all over Rome, of course, looking for clues among the art treasures, in the Vatican archives, crypts under churches, and all sorts of creepy places. I'm not going to ruin the incredibly complex plot by telling you any more, except to remind you that just as the theft of the antimatter was apparently an inside job at the lab, clearly there is an inside man in the Vatican and nobody is to be trusted. OK; you can trust Langdon and Vetra; but watch the rest of them very carefully.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>The Pope has passed, and in the moments before the preferiti - the Cardinals next in line to be the Pope - are to be notified of succession, the Illuminati kidnaps them before their seclusion.  The mysterious and clandestine Illuminati plan on killing all four Cardinals at altars along the "Path of Illumination," and then destroying the Vatican with stolen antimatter from CERN.  Paired with CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), noted symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to neutralize the Illuminati's threat by saving the Cardinals and recovering the antimatter.<br /><br />What is apparent upon first viewing is a heavy dosage of Dan Brown's influence, that Tom Hanks is Robert Langdon personified, and themes of technology versus faith flow seamlessly into all facets of the film.  The visual aspects of A&D are absolutely stunning.  Considering Roman Catholic officials wouldn't allow filming inside any of their churches, the visual smorgasbord is even more impressive.  A&D has everything from St. Peter's Square to the Vatican and Sistine Chapel, it's what amounts to history and landmark pornography.  To look for some of the intricacies from this film while wandering throughout Rome might be ridiculous, but the special effects are done so well the viewer may get the feeling of a Frommer's tour guide.<br /><br />If Brown's meticulously researched style is your thing, then this wonderfully translated movie - despite its differences with the book - is sure to excite.  Fast paced and full of enough thrills to distract from the esotericism inherent in all of Brown's work, the action and acting are balanced predictably well for a big budget film featuring Hanks and Ewan McGregor.<br /><br />Bow down to the religious conspiracy in this adult version of National Treasure.  Honestly, taking Nicolas Cage out of any movie is a good move, amirite?<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Ron Howard has led a team of who's who in Hollywood to crank out another one of the town's patented "Must-Be Blockbusters."  In times of yore, Hollywood would crank out "must-see" movies that were so good that, if you missed them, you felt like the village idiot.  Now, however, when an author writes a smash hit (and Dan Brown's "Angels & Demons" surely qualifies), Hollywood invests hundreds of millions buying and adapting the book into a movie, leaving no expense unspent in its quest to crank out a sure-fire smash hit.  So expensive are these movies that they become products of a thousand hands, trying to maximize the tickets sold rather than just tell the darn story as well as the author did the first time.<br /><br />And so it is that "Angels & Demons" hit the big screen and went away without raising so much as an eyebrow.  This non-essential film is satisfied to hit the necessary high points of the book within the time allotted (no three-hour movie here - we have to get enough screenings per day on 3,000 multiplexes).  All the marks are hit - Tom Hanks is the acting royalty in the lead, Ron Howard is behind the camera, and top-notch screenwriters, composers, cinematographers, and make-up staff on on the scene, probably down to the top Key Grip in the industry.  But the movie progresses from scene to scene without generating a hint of tension or interest, and when the final credits roll you wonder, what was the point?<br /><br />"A&D" tells a dark, sinister, thrilling story.  A dangerous quasi-religious sect has kidnapped four candidates for the papacy after the death of the beloved Pope.  Proclaiming vengeance for the Catholic Church's repugnant persectuion of scientists over the centuries, the Illuminati promise to murder these priests along with blowing up half of Rome with antimatter.  Dr. Robert Langdon (Hanks) is whisked away from the Harvard swimmming pool to save the HQ of Christendom, which is a little strange because everyone in the Church heirarchy is still mad at him over the recent events in Paris in "The Da Vinci Code."<br /><br />A pell-mell race against time ensues, but one that unfortunately skims over the coolest aspect of the book - Dan Brown's explanations of the various symbols hiding in plain sight throughout the Vatican.  Hanks remains Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors.  But it gets tiresome that he rubs up against movie stars in every conceivable role, or if they aren't movie stars then they are clearly in the "Hey, It's That Guy" club.  Remember the scene at the end of "The Player," when the movie that was supposed to be made "with no stars" eventually becomes a bloated mess starring Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, and every well-known supporting actor in Hollywood?  That's "A&D" in a nutshell.<br /><br />I saw an interview with Tom Hanks where he talked about filming "A&D."  Like Mel Brooks saying, "It's good to be the king," Hanks waxed nostaligic about sitting at a sidewalk cafe in Rome waiting for the filmmakers to get a scene set up.  I think we can all agree that Hanks likely had a terrific time making this movie.  It doesn't mean that you're going to have a great time watching it.<br /><br />The only thing that is truly terrific about this movie is its capturing of the beauty and majesty that can be found in Rome and the Vatican.  Statues, domes, fountains, and even cobbled streets shine with a divine glory everywhere you look.  For that alone, the movie is recommended.<br /><br />But if you want a thrill ride through Rome and the Vatican, courtesy of the murderous Illuminati, I suggest you just read Dan Brown's book.  You will see what the movie missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Considering how enjoyable the critically derided Da Vinci Code turned out to be if you didn't take it seriously, it's surprising how weak the slightly better reviewed follow-up, Angels and Demons, turned out. The kind of film that manages to look at once expensive and cheap, it's a lot less effective than the first film - the casting is much poorer, the script considerably weaker (especially one big rallying speech) and the absence of flashback montages makes the exposition seem far more perfunctory than its predecessor, not least because Hanks seems so bored with it all for much of the movie. Even the literal ticking clock device that drives the plot fails to produce any tension despite the high stakes, the villain and his motivation fairly obvious through heavy-handed writing and a couple of strikingly unconvincingly acted scenes long before the absurd sequence involving an anti-matter bomb, a helicopter and a parachute...<br /><br />Everything is more run-of-the-mill here - even the internal Vatican politics play like the kind of TV miniseries that went out of fashion in the 70s, complete with a feelgood finale that sees its medieval conspiracy theory proved a blind and its atheist hero firmly back in God's good books to reassure the faithful that God is in his heaven and all's well with the Church. It's watchable but uninspired, feeling more like a film that was rushed into production to cash-in on its predecessor as quickly as possibly rather than something that took a few years to reach the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>I confess:  I fell asleep -- twice -- while trying to watch the Da Vince Code, so I wasn't exactly anxious to see this movie; however, Angels and Demons kept my attention from start to finish.  Although it wasn't great cinema, at least I didn't have to listen to Tom Hanks talk in rapid fire exposition just to get to the next scene.  Instead of offering intellectual treatise on centuries of conspiracy, Angels and Demons is more physical, more visceral, with the fear of mass destruction taking the front seat to the finer details of the Illuminati.  The film is more or less a series of chase scenes, with Robert Langdon (Hanks) teaming up with physicist Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) to stop the imminent murders of four cardinals as the other cardinals meet to elect a new pope.  The kidnapper has a dangerous capsule filled with anti-matter stolen from Vittoria's lab at the Cern Accelerator, and its detonation could destroy all of Vatican City and a good portion of Rome.  Add tension between the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who presides over the conclave, and the plot gets just enough complexity to add a twist or two.  The only aspect that is truly annoying is the time-line:  the characters have only an hour to identify and get to each location, yet they seem to take their time until the last minute.  And there's no way that everything that happens could do so within the amount of time described.  Just suspend your disbelief, and go along for the ride.<br /><br />The conspiracy theory in Angels and Demons is less intricate than that of The Da Vinci Code and thus makes for better cinema.  The simpler plot allows for one chase scene, one murder, one explosion/fire after another.  For this reason, it is an exciting action film without offering much to consider in retrospect.  It is decent entertainment, but not much else, making it a good choice when you want your adrenalin to course and your brain to coast.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I bought this only because I read the back of the DVD and it sounded interesting and it was on sale.

This was a non stop action/thinking man' picture.<br />Take the best elements of an action film,mix it up with the best moments of National Treasure or the 1990's Mummy series with Brendan Fraser along with some horror elements & POOF! you get a great movie.<br />Tom Hanks was brilliant in this, in fact the entire cast was tremendous. Hanks character as Robert Langdon as a character that we as viewers can root for. For me it was a rare thing in today's movie to actually like the character and root for him to stop the evil doings.<br />The story has Langdon tracking down an evil society known as the Illuminati who are murdering 4 Cardinals for the sake of religion, sin and God. It was a thrill ride as Langdon goes from one Church to another in pursuit, going through catacombs, crypts, following signs to track the group down.<br />It was very , VERY suspenseful, non stop & just a lot of fun to watch. The gore pieces were really well done. One scene with rats reminded me of a movie called Virgin of Nuremberg. It wasnt gory just have gore, it was more of style like Dario Argento used to do. It was also refreshing to have a man and woman work together and not have a romantic interest. It was also refreshing to see a more mature picture or a film where characters have that 'been there,done that' attitude with corny dialog. It wasn't tongue in cheek (thank God)<br />Now I will say I haven't read the book as I am more of a movie watcher so I can not compare the movie to the book.

This book is considered to be the #1 book in the Robert Langdon series as it was written before Da Vinci Code. However, with sales & marketing, most people assume Da Vinci Code is #1. A&D happens before the Da Vinci code. However, Ron Howard & team decided to make A&D happen after DVC in the timeline with several references to DVC. BTW, The Lost Symbol is considered #3 in the series happening after both DVC and A&D.<br /><br />The story opens at CERN with a group of scientists trying to create anti-matter in large quantities. There are references to finding the "god" particle. We soon learn that one of the scientists is killed and his eye used to gain access to the secure room with the anti-matter. One large container (magnetic enclosure container) was stolen.<br /><br />Flash forward to Robert Langdon's apartment where a Vatican police officer approaches Langdon to come to Rome to help with an investigation. Well, it is an active case with four kidnapped Cardinales who are to be killed one each hour leading up to midnight when a (anti-matter) bomb will destroy the Vatican. At this time, the current Pope has died (humm, maybe murdered?) and traditional efforts are happening to pick the new Pope. Oh, the four Cardinales are the four leading contenders for the role of new Pope. Why Langdon? Ah, the people claiming to cause this are the Illuminati of which Langdon has been working on a book about them.<br /><br />Langdon performs some quick research in the Vatican Archives to learn where to start the search for the Cardinales. As with Da Vinci Code, Langdon's search is lead by symbols and history. As he chases each of the four victims, he is too late for most.'<br /><br />The cool thing about this story is that it takes place within 12 hours of real-time. It is fast paced, exciting, good action with Langdon becoming more of an Indiana Jones with some of the action. The Langdon character is deeply and richly described and is likely to become iconic much like Jones.<br /><br />As before with Da Vinci, Dan Brown's deep research and crafting of historical facts and locations to meet his needs for the story is impressive. It is interesting to note that all of the Vatican scenes were created in LA as they couldn't get permission to film. Scenes of other locations around Rome were shot on-site. The detail and richness of the sets and costumes is amazing! Tom Hanks as Langdon is wonderful and he is well on his way to being an icon. I can only hope that Howard/Hanks are working on the Lost Symbol.<br /><br />I highly recommend Angels and Demons it is now on my favorites list. I specially recommend the Blu-Ray 3 disk set with an entire disk of behind-the-scenes materials.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>When I watched this movie, I assumed that it's entirely fiction and that it makes no attempt to comment on the Catholic church or its history.  That may not be the actual case, but I think it's the best way to approach the movie.<br /><br />From that standpoint, I found this movie fairly entertaining.  The acting, scenery, and special effects are solid, as one would expect with a big-budget high-profile movie like this.  The plot, though implausible in many ways, still manages to passably hang together, and it's plenty suspenseful with some good twists and turns, so I had no problem staying engaged for the full duration of this fairly long movie.  And the ending was also pretty good, surprising me in some ways without feeling artificially tacked on or rushed.<br /><br />As far as broader messages we might apply to real life, I see two of them.  First, as the movie emphasizes, it's silly to assume that science and religion must be in conflict; that's the case only if one or both of them dogmatically overstep their bounds (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809136066">Science and Religion: From Conflict to Conversation</a> by John Haught for a good book on this).  Second, in a world which is now dangerously replete with nuclear weapons and other WMDs, we really need to think carefully about where our science and technology may lead before we continue developing them; it's immature and irresponsible to pursue them simply because we wish to satisfy our curiosity, revel in our ingenuity, or perpetually raise our standard of living (enough is enough at some point).<br /><br />Overall, this certainly isn't one of those really great movies which changes you for a long time (or permanently), but it's still decent entertainment, so I can recommend it to people looking for a combination of detective work, action, and suspense, all with a background of religious symbolism.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>THE DA VINCI CODE was easily one of the most lackluster action thrillers in recent ages.  To be fair, the movie didn't have much going for it: miscasting in the lead role (Hanks is great, don't get me wrong, but he's not fit for thrillers); a short time frame (to cash in on the book's popularity); and a rather mediocre source novel (let's face it, Dan Brown isn't a literary master; he's just good at pushing buttons).  The film had some good supporting performances, but overall it simply wasn't as good as a Ron Howard film should be.<br /><br />ANGELS & DEMONS is an improvement from that.  The film is pretty much a nonstop race to stop the religious terrorist organization Illuminati from setting off an anti-matter bomb.  It picks up quickly and never rests.  It isn't quite as good as the book--the novel, while no great piece of literature, is a decent-enough thriller, and far better than its sequel--but let's blame that on the PG-13 rating; the novel was gory and dark, with a truly haunting premise and enough truth-bending "facts" to make for a thoughtful (if not accurate) thrill ride.  The film has toned it down a bit, honing the dark, rough edges to make it a little more palatable for movie-going audiences.  And sure, it still doesn't feel like a Ron Howard film (anybody could have made this); and sure, Tom Hanks is STILL miscast; but we have three great supporting roles--from Stellan Skarsgard, Ewen McGreggor, and Armin Mueller-Stahl--and enough action for us to forgive the fact that the movie doesn't go as far with its subject as it should.<br /><br />Of course, thrillers like this--where the facts are bent, where the action and cliched dialogue is laid on so thick that close inspection of the details is all but impossible--have their audience, and ANGELS & DEMONS delivers to that audience in spades.  So, in those regards, this film is definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre.  If, on the other hand, you're like me and just wanted to kill two hours with some mindless entertainment, you can see this one or not; you won't be missing much, but it is, if nothing else, entertaining.  Perhaps that's the best we can expect from mainstream Hollywood these days.  (Though we certainly expect more from Ron Howard.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I actually liked how this package ended up taking more time to read than watch (and I did watch both versions). Regardless of your take on the book to film translation or beliefs, the film came across on Blu wonderfully.<br /><br />The Blu clarity is finite throughout with the only shortcomings being the CGI and green screen lines. The DTS was superb, though the score drowns out some material a few times, but certain sequences were reference (the interior water sounds at unrated 48:10 and several dialogue echoes in chambers throughout). The case is a much stronger hinge than the other Blus I have rated this quarter (wish they were all made this way) and I actually had to work at breaking it.<br /><br />BD DISC 1: (Films only)<br />Both versions of the film are playable with CineChat or MovieIQ. There was no one online yet for Cinechat so I was pretty lonely on that one. MovieIQ only takes a minute to load up on my PS3 and provides the usual plethora of IMDBish material and trivia regarding plot, actors, score, etc. The unrated plays eight minutes longer and the edits are scattered equally (1.5 minutes  added in by the 24-minute mark, 5 minutes by the burning scene). The main rating change would have been in the burning sequence as they edited out all of the kills in the rated (the gore is graphic so would have garnered an R here).<br /><br />BD DISC 2: (Supplements only)<br /><br />Rome Not built in a Day: 17:30 minute making of. Shows the amount of CGI involved and the usual logistical stuff and interviews.<br />Writing: 10:09 minute Ron Howard interview narration on the script and such.<br />Characters: 17:10 minutes of interviews and the actors giving their takes on what they were trying to do here.<br />CERN: 14:50 minute documentary about the science center shown in the film. I liked this the most but I am a dork that way, will probably be the dryest supplement for most people.<br />Props: 11:35 minute take on the obvious need to make the stuff look good.<br />Full Story: 9:46 minute further making of with Ron Howard. Covers some wardrobe stuff and could have been included with the first one.<br />Ambigram: 4:46 minute history of the word history by John Langdon. Interesting little tidbits here adn there - especially the part (they show from the film) where his book is next to the one Hanks picks off a shelf.<br /><br />Path of Illumination.<br />Five sections of learning material divided into two parts each, one part has Ron Howard describing the section (Plaza, Pantheon, etc.) and the other part has tons of textual info regarding the location selected. If you read everything offered it can eat up an hour or so. I think the experience is worthwhile and it contained some solid material.<br /><br />DISC 3: Digital Copy and Zimmer Music software.<br /><br />* The Music part (copy/pasted from text info):<br />" This trial version provides the full functionality of the Sequel 2 retail version. While it contains only a selection of the retail version's content, three Hans Zimmer projects with audio material from the movie Angels & Demons have been added. Feel free to modify the projects with the sounds and tools Sequel 2 Trial Angels & Demons Edition has to offer. Pictures taken from the movie have been added to the list of track icons, which are used to label individual tracks."<br /><br />The installation process takes a bit as it puts in several programs - but I must not be musically inclined because the program looks overwhelming. LOTS to go through with music creation, recording, and so on - wow.<br /><br />* There are weblinks and Sony website sign-up info for getting Sony stuff.<br /><br />Overall, a large volume of material added to another history/drama/Hanks/Howard production that entertains the masses. Enjoy.<br /><br />EDIT: A good point was brought up after I posted this review about the artwork pictured here - this set is the 3 disc BD set described (but the artwork is the same as you would get on the 2 disc DVD set).</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />  I've never been a big fan of the material Ron Howard chooses for his movies. The 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' are no exception. But by the same token I will concede that Mr. Howard has come along way as a director. Most of his films are technically brilliant and he has evolved in his abilities to direct his actors.<br /><br />  After consulting Wikipedia's article on this film, I learned that there is actually an organization, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and there actually is a contraption, the 'Large Hadron Collider'. I also found out that the organization spent a good deal of time reassuring the local population that what they were doing was safe. Therefore, the whole idea that they could create anti-matter in three small cylinders, which could be capable of creating a low-grade nuclear-like explosion and then some psycho could somehow get through security at the facility and steal this anti-matter, was laughable.<br /><br />  If you're a Vatican History buff, you'll find 'Angels and Demons' just up your alley. The story begins with the death of the pope and a papal enclave is convened to choose the pope's successor. You'll find out who the 'preferiti' are--the four most likely candidates to be elected pope; they're kidnapped and immediately the Vatican police assume that the the Vatican's nemesis, the Illuminati, a secret society persecuted by the Catholic Church dating back to the time of Galileo, is behind the nefarious deed. In a nutshell, The Illuminati were the 'free-thinkers' who were suppressed by the Church during the Enlightenment, due to their advocacy of science. Later they supposedly turned violent and held a grudge against the Church for years.<br /><br />  Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon, the Harvard symbologist who is summoned by the Vatican police to save the four cardinals. Also called in is Vittoria Vetra, the scientist at CERN who's in charge of replacing the cylinder's batteries since once they run out, the explosion will occur (where was the Energizer bunny when you needed him most?) Langdon demands access to the Vatican Secret Archives where he discovers clues in a banned book by Galileo. The clues lead to four points of the compass in Vatican City, representing the four elements--fire, earth, air and water. Langdon deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered at four altars at these four different locations.<br /><br />  Langdon races around Vatican City along with the Vatican Police trying to save the four cardinals. The first three cardinals are dispatched in the manner associated with each particular element: Earth: Cardinal #1--suffocated by dirt; Air: Cardinal #2--lungs are punctured; and Fire: Cardinal #3--burned to death. Langdon manages to save Cardinal #4 who is dropped into a WATER fountain in a weighted gurney. The fourth Cardinal clues Langdon into the Assassin's lair--where the four cardinals had been held earlier. The police find the killer's van at a Mausoleum but conclude it's a dead end. Langdon and Vetra find a secret passageway and end up confronting the assassin who holds a gun on them. He reveals he's been hired by the Catholic church but has no orders to kill them so he lets them go (not at all credible). Langdon finds the last clue in the form of crossed keys, the Papal symbol. He concludes that the final victim will be Camerlengo McKenna (a priest who is chief administrator at the Vatican). The crafty assassin who outwits everybody, is unconvincingly outwitted himself by stepping inside a car and getting blown up by a car bomb (who worked that out, I have no idea!).<br /><br />  Now here's how all this nonsense is saved by the twist ending (SPOILER ALERT!). We're led to believe that the Camerlengo is the good guy. He tries to convince Cardinal Strauss, the head honcho at the conclave to evacuate the Vatican, since the anti-matter is about to explode. The Cardinal, and the other stuffed shirts want to follow their protocol in choosing the pope, so they decide to rely on the Vatican police (along with Langdon) to save the day by finding the anti-matter. Also when Langdon finds the Camerlengo with the chief of the Vatican police, it appears the Illuminati have already branded him (just as they did with the four other cardinals) and the Camerlengo blurts out that the Police chief is in league with the Illuminati (so he gets killed). Finally, when the anti-matter cylinder batteries are about to run out, the Camerlengo (who believe it or not, has training as a helicopter pilot) takes the cylinder up into the clouds in a helicopter, where the anti-matter explodes but kills no one. The Camerlengo parachutes to safety and is hailed as a hero--in fact, the conclave (using an arcane rule) wants to vote him in as the new Pope.<br /><br />  The twist is when Langdon, using a key the Vatican Police Chief gave him just before he dies, unlocks surveillance video stored on the hard drive of the Chief's private computer, revealing that it was the Camerlengo who was the bad guy all along. Not only did he kill the three cardinals but also his adoptive father, the Pope himself. It seems that the Camerlengo was mad at the Pope due to his liberal stance toward science. After Langdon reveals the plot to the Papal enclave, the Camerlengo commits suicide by setting himself on fire.<br /><br />  Ron Howard did well in concluding that the Da Vinci sequel needed to move at a faster pace. And kudos to the production team who recreated Vatican City without having any access to shooting there. Despite the positives, I did sit through most of 'Angels and Demons' with a smirk on my face. After all, the entire premise is based on completely implausible events. But I have to admit, the twist ending at the end is so clever, that I didn't see it coming at all! And yes, I'm willing to say, despite all the hokeyness, to a certain extent, it won me over.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING!<br /><br />The Vatican is threatened by an anti-matter bomb in the middle of a papal election. Four prominent candidates to the papacy are kidnapped and held incommunicado. Until they are murdered in various grizzly ways, that is. The secret order of the Illuminati claims responsibility, and Professor Langdon of "Da Vinci Code" fame is called in to crack their usual symbols and riddles. This time, he has to work even faster - the bomb is set to destroy most of Rome at midnight the same day. The usual suspects turn out to be the good guys, while the good guys turn out to be...well, Illuminati.<br /><br />OK, I admit it. I didn't threw up when watching "Angels and Demons". The film is better than "The Da Vinci Code". But then, virtually everything is better than *that* horrendous production!<br /><br />"Angels and Demons" is also more irenic. This time, the old men of the Catholic Church and their security apparatus turn out to be on our side. The Illuminati are the criminals. The pro-occult tendencies of the first movie have been quietly excised, and I don't think anybody so much as mentions the Devil. The story ends with faith and science holding hands in the election of a new pope, while one of the cardinals gives Professor Langdon a precious document by Galileo. Amen to that.<br /><br />As for the God particle...please come on. ;-)<br /><br />I really wanted to diss "Angels and Demons", but I admit that it's OK as lighter Friday night entertainment (or Thursday night, in my case). I feel charitable nine minutes past midnight, so I'll give this film three stars. How about that?</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie is much like Da Vicni code, but there'[s enough differences to keep the two from being copies of one another. I haven't read Angels and Demons, but given how much I enjoyed Da Vinci Code, I should enjoy this book as well. The movie was very enjoyable - if you like Da Vinci Code, you should like this, though I thought Da Vinci Code was better.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This film is clever just like the book. It just has so much to pack into the movie. You can't really get to know the characters as well. I liked the Vatican and the majesty of its architecture and its clergy. I would like to go there one day and tell my story. I love Italy. I loved Robert's quick mind, he is so intelligent and can put things together faster than a computer. It would be fun to put together clues and find the treasure or answer at the end or throughout. I recommend the Da Vinchi Code over this film yet it has a similiar thread just not as much of a find at the end, not as mysterious of a quest and not as rich with character development.</p></br></body></html>
